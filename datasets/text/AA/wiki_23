Antrim Senior Hurling Championship

The Antrim Senior Hurling Championship (known for sponsorship reasons as the Bathshack.com Antrim Senior Hurling Championship and abbreviated to the Antrim SHC) is an annual club hurling competition organised by the Antrim County Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association. It is contested by the top-ranking senior clubs in the county of Antrim, Northern Ireland, with the winners decided through a group and knockout format. It is the most prestigious competition in Antrim hurling.
In its present format, the eight teams are drawn into two groups of four teams and play each other in a single round-robin system. The two group winners proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final. The winner of the Antrim Senior Championship, as well as being presented with the Volunteer Cup, qualifies for the subsequent Ulster Club Championship.
The competition has been won by 19 teams, 15 of which have won it more than once. Loughgiel Shamrocks is the most successful team in the tournament's history, having won it 20 times. RuairÍ Óg, Cushendall are the reigning champions, having beaten Cúchulains Dunloy by 1-16 to 2–12 in the 2024 final.
Commonly the final takes place at Antrim's county stadium, Casement Park. However, on account of the ground's ongoing redevelopment the 2013 and 2014 finals were held at Páirc Mac Uílín in Ballycastle. The 2015 final was held at Dunloy's Pearse Park, due to McQuillan Ballycastle's appearance in the decider.

Constitutional Court of Thailand

The Constitutional Court (, , ), officially the Constitutional Court of the Kingdom of Thailand, is a Thai court created by the 1997 constitution with jurisdiction over the constitutionality of parliamentary acts, royal decrees, draft legislation, as well as the appointment and removal of public officials and issues regarding political parties. The current court is part of the judicial branch of the Thai national government.
The court, along with the 1997 constitution, was dissolved and replaced by a Constitutional Tribunal in 2006 following the 2006 Thai coup d'état. While the Constitutional Court had 15 members, seven from the judiciary and eight selected by a special panel, the Constitution Tribunal had nine members, all from the judiciary. A similar institution, consisting of nine members, was again established by the 2007 Constitution.
The Constitutional Court has provoked much public debate, both regarding the court's jurisdiction and composition as well as the initial selection of justices. A long-standing issue has been the degree of control exerted by the judiciary over the court.
The decisions of the court are final and not subject to appeal. Its decisions bind every state organ, including the National Assembly, the Council of Ministers, and other courts.
The various iterations of the court have made several significant decisions. These include the 1999 decision that Newin Chidchop, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, could retain his seat in cabinet after being sentenced to imprisonment for defamation; the 2001 acquittal of Thaksin Shinawatra for filing an incomplete statement regarding his assets with the National Anti-Corruption Commission; the 2003 invalidation of Jaruvan Maintaka's appointment as auditor-general; the 2007 dissolution of the Thai Rak Thai political party; the 2014 removal of prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office; the dissolution of the Thai Raksa Chart Party before the March 2019 election; the dissolution of the Future Forward Party in 2020 and its successor Move Forward Party in 2024; and the removal of Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin in 2024.
The FY2019 budget of the Constitutional Court is 223.7 million Baht. , its president is Nakharin Mektrairat.
Origins and controversy.
Drafting of the 1997 constitution.
The creation of the Constitutional Court was the subject of much debate during the 1996–1997 drafting of the 1997 Constitution of Thailand. Senior judges opposed the concept on the grounds that constitutional and judicial review should remain a prerogative of the Supreme Court and that a Constitutional Court would create a fourth branch of government more powerful than the judiciary, legislature, or executive. Judges stated their fear over political interference in the selection and impeachment of judges. The Constitution Drafting Assembly (CDA) eventually made several concessions regarding the composition and powers of the court.
Jurisdiction.
The constitution did not give the Constitutional Court the authority to overrule a final judgment of the Supreme Court. An affected party, or a court, could request the opinion from the Constitutional Court if it believed a case involved a constitutional issue. The court where the initial action was pending would stay its proceedings until the Constitutional Court issued its decision. Constitutional court decisions would have no retroactive effect on previous decisions of the regular courts.
The constitution also did not give the Constitutional Court the authority to rule on any case in which the constitution did not specifically delegate an agency the power to adjudicate.
Impeachment.
The constitution allowed individual justices to be the subject of impeachment proceedings with the vote of one-fourth of the members of the House or with the approval of 50,000 petitioners. A vote of three-fifths of the Senate is required for impeachment. Earlier drafts had required votes of only 10% of the combined House and Senate to call for a vote of impeachment, and votes of three-fifths of the combined Parliament of Thailand to dismiss a justice.
Appointment.
The constitution gave the judiciary a strong influence over the composition of the Constitutional Court. Originally, the court was to have nine justices including six legal experts and three political science experts. A panel of 17 persons would propose 18 names from which parliament would elect the nine justices. The panel president would be the president of the Supreme Court of Thailand, the panel itself would have included four political party representatives. The CDA finally compromised and allowed seven of the justices to be selected by the judiciary, while the remaining eight justices would be selected by the Senate from a list of Supreme Court nominees.
Appointment of the first Constitutional Court.
The appointment of the first Constitutional Court following the promulgation of the constitution in 1997 was four month controversy pitting the Senate of Thailand against the Supreme Court. A key issue was the senate's authority to review the backgrounds of judicial nominees and reject nominees deemed inappropriate or unqualified.
Appointment of Amphorn Thongprayoon.
After receiving the Supreme Court's list of nominees, the Senate created a committee to review the nominees' credentials and backgrounds. On 24 November 1997, the Senate voted to remove the name of Supreme Court Vice-president Amphorn Thongprayoon, on the grounds that his credentials were dubious and on allegations that he had defaulted on three million Baht in debt. The Supreme Court was furious, arguing the constitution did not empower the senate to do background checks or to reject Supreme Court nominees. The Supreme Court requested a ruling from the Constitutional Tribunal chaired by the House speaker. On 8 January 1998, in a six to three vote, the Tribunal ruled the Senate did "not" have the authority to do background checks or reject the Supreme Court's nominees. The Tribunal ruled that the Senate's review powers were limited to examining the records of the nominees and electing half of those nominees for appointment.
Immediately after the Supreme Court filed its request to the Tribunal, Justice Amphorn withdrew his name. After the Tribunal's ruling, the Supreme Court elected justice Jumpol na Songkhla on 9 January 1998 to replace Amphorn. The Senate ignored the Tribunal's ruling and proceeded to review Jumphol's background and delayed a vote to accept his nomination for seven days so that the Senate could evaluate Jumphol. Finding no problems, the Senate acknowledged his appointment to the court on 23 January 1998.
Appointment of Ukrit Mongkolnavin.
The appointment of former Senate and Parliament president Ukrit Mongkolnavin was especially problematic. The Senate had initially elected Ukrit from the list of ten legal specialists nominated by the selection panel, despite claims by democracy activists that Ukrit was unqualified to guard the constitution because he had served dictators while president of parliament under the 1991–1992 military government of the National Peacekeeping Council.
Stung by the Senate rejection of Amphorn Thongprayoon, the two Bangkok Civil Court judges, Sriampron Salikhup and Pajjapol Sanehasangkhom, petitioned the Constitutional Tribunal to disqualify Ukrit on a legal technicality. They argued that Ukrit only had an honorary professorship at Chulalongkorn University, while the 1997 constitution specifically specifies that a nominee, if not meeting other criteria, must be at least a professor. Echoing the Senate's rejection of Amphorn, the judges also alleged that Ukrit was involved in a multi-million baht lawsuit over a golf course. On 10 January 1998, the Tribunal ruled that the judges were not affected parties and therefore they had no right to request a ruling. Nevertheless, the parliament's president invoked his power as chairman of the tribunal to ask the Senate to reconsider Ukrit's nomination.
On 19 January 1998, the Senate reaffirmed Ukrit's qualifications, noting that his professorship was special only because he was not a government official. Under Chulalongkorn's regulations, he had the academic status of a full professor.
This position inflamed activists and the judiciary, and prompted the parliament president on 21 January to invoke his authority under Article 266 of the 1997 Constitution to order the Constitutional Tribunal to consider the issue. On 8 February, in a four to three vote, the tribunal ruled that Ukrit's special professorship did "not" qualify him for a seat on the Constitutional Court. The tribunal noted that Chulalongkorn's criteria for honorary professorship were different from its criteria for academic professors, as intended by the Constitution. The Senate ended up electing Komain Patarapirom to replace Ukrit.
Jurisdiction.
Under the 2007 Constitution, the court is competent to address the following:
Composition.
1997 Constitution.
The Constitutional Court was modeled after the Constitutional Court of Italy. According to the 1997 constitution, the court had 15 members, all serving nine year terms and appointed by the king upon senatorial advice:
2006 Constitution.
According to the 2006 Constitution, the Constitutional Tribunal was established to replace the Constitutional Court which had been dissolved by the Council for Democratic Reform. The Tribunal had nine members as follows:
2007 Constitution.
After the Constitutional Court was abolished by the Council for Democratic Reform and was replaced by the Constitutional Tribunal under the 2006 Constitution, the 2007 Constitution reestablishes the Constitutional Court and makes various changes to it. The court is back with greater vigour and is also empowered to introduce to the National Assembly the draft laws concerning the court itself.
Under the 2007 Constitution, the Constitutional Court has nine members, all serving for nine year terms and appointed by the King with senatorial advice:
2017 constitution.
After the 2014 Thai coup d'état, the court had not been dissolved. Until the 2017 constitution of Thailand was in effect, the judges from the 2007 Constitutional Court continued to work on the 2017 Court.
Key decisions.
Chuan-government emergency decrees during the 1997 economic crisis.
Unconstitutionality of emergency economic decrees.
In its first decision, the court ruled on the constitutionality of four emergency executive decrees issued by the Chuan government to deal with the Asian financial crisis. The government had issued the decrees in early-May 1998 to expand the role of the Financial Restructuring Authority and the Assets Management Corporation, to settle the debts of the Financial Institutions Development Fund through the issue of 500 billion baht in bonds, and to authorize the ministry of finance to seek 200 billion baht in overseas loans. The opposition New Aspiration Party (NAP) did not have the votes to defeat the bills, and therefore, on the last day of debate, invoked Article 219 of the constitution to question the constitutionality of an emergency decree.
The NAP argued that since there was no emergency nor necessary urgency (under Article 218(2)), the government could not issue any emergency decrees. Article 219, however, specifically notes the constitutionality of an emergency decree can be questioned only on Article 218(1) concerning the maintenance of national or public safety, national economic security, or to avert public calamity. The government, fearing further economic damage if the decree were delayed, opposed the court's acceptance of the complaint, as the opposition clearly had failed to cite the proper constitutional clause. The court wished to set a precedent, however, demonstrating it would accept petitions under Article 219, even if technically inaccurate. Within a day it ruled that it was obvious to the general public that the nation was in an economic crisis, and that the decrees were designed to assist with national economic security in accordance with Article 218(1). The decrees were later quickly approved by Parliament.
The NAP's last minute motion damaged its credibility, and made it unlikely that Article 219 will be invoked unless there is a credible issue and the issue is raised and discussed at the beginning of parliamentary debate, rather than at the last-minute before a vote.
On the other hand, a precedent was established by the court that it would accept all petitions under Article 219 to preserve Parliament's right to question the constitutionality of emergency executive decrees.
Treaty status of IMF letters of intent.
The NAP later filed impeachment proceedings with the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) against prime minister Chuan Leekpai and the minister of finance Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda for violation of the Constitution. The NAP argued that the letter of intent that the government signed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to secure emergency financial support was a treaty, and that Article 224 of the constitution stipulated that the government must receive prior consent from Parliament to enter a treaty.
The NACC determined the issue concerned a constitutional interpretation and petitioned the Constitutional Court for an opinion. The court ruled the IMF letters were not treaties, as internationally defined, because they were unilateral documents from the Thai government with no rules for enforcement or provisions for penalty. Moreover, the IMF itself had worded the letters in a way that stated that the letters were not contractual agreements.
Appointment of Jaruvan Maintaka as auditor-general.
On 24 June 2003, a petition was filed with the Constitutional Court seeking its decision on the constitutionality of Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka's appointment by the Senate as auditor-general. Jaruvan was one of three nominees for the position of auditor-general in 2001, along with Prathan Dabpet and Nontaphon Nimsomboon. Prathan received five votes from the eight person State Audit Commission (SAC) while Jaruvan received three votes. According to the constitution, State Audit Commission chairman Panya Tantiyavarong should have submitted Prathan's nomination to the Senate, as he received the majority of votes. However, on 3 July 2001, the SAC chairman submitted a list of all three candidates for the post of auditor-general to the Senate, which later voted to select Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka.
The Constitutional Court ruled on 6 July 2004 that the selection process that led to the appointment of Jaruvan as auditor-general was unconstitutional. The court noted that the constitution empowers the SAC to nominate only one person with the highest number of votes from a simple majority, not three as had been the case. The court stopped short of saying she had to leave her post. However, when the Constitutional Court had ruled on 4 July 2002 that the then Election Commission chairman Sirin Thoopklam's election to the body was unconstitutional, the president of the court noted "when the court rules that the selection [process] was unconstitutional and has to be redone, the court requires the incumbent to leave the post".
Jaruwan refused to resign without a royal dismissal from King Bhumibol Adulyadej. She noted "I came to take the position as commanded by a royal decision, so I will leave the post only when directed by such a decision." The State Audit Commission later nominated Wisut Montriwat, former deputy permanent secretary of the ministry of finance, for the post of auditor-general. The Senate approved the nomination on 10 May 2005. However, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in an unprecedented move, withheld his royal assent. The National Assembly did not hold a vote to overthrow the royal veto. In October 2005, the Senate rejected a motion to reaffirm her appointment, and instead deferred the decision to the SAC.
On 15 February 2006 the State Audit Commission (SAC) reinstated Auditor-General Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka. Its unanimous decision came after it received a memo from the office of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's principal private secretary, directing that the situation be resolved.
The controversy led many to reinterpret the political and judicial role of the King in Thailand's constitutional monarchy.
Thaksin Shinawatra's alleged conflicts of interest.
In February 2006, 28 Senators submitted a petition to the Constitutional Court calling for the prime minister's impeachment for conflicts of interest and improprieties in the sell-off of Shin Corporation under Articles 96, 216 and 209 of the Thai constitution. The Senators said the prime minister violated the constitution and was no longer qualified for office under Article 209. However, the court rejected the petition on 16 February, with the majority judges saying the petition failed to present sufficient grounds to support the prime minister's alleged misconduct.
Court rejects flawed oath petition.
In September 2019, the court rejected a petition lodged by the Ombudsman of Thailand regarding the incomplete oath recited by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha and his cabinet in July 2019. The prime minister failed to recite the final sentence of the oath which pledges to uphold and abide by the Constitution. The court ruled that it was "not in its authority" to make a ruling on the issue, in effect ruling that vows to uphold the constitution are none of the Constitutional Court's business.
Future Forward Party dissolution.
On 20 November 2019, the court convicted Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, disqualifying his MP status. On 21 February 2020, Future Forward Party was dissolved in the court ruling, which said that the party was in violation of election laws regarding donations to political parties. The party was loaned 191.2 million Baht (about US$6 million) from its leader, Thanathorn, according to the court, counted as a donation. The dissolution order drew criticism from commentators inside and outside the country, who characterized it as part of the military's continued interference in Thai politics, noting that the party's vocal anti-military position made it a target and that the other parties' finances were not similarly scrutinized.
Court rules that Prayut not "state official".
The court ruled in September 2019, that General Prayut, on seizing power in May 2014 with no authorization to do so, answering to no other state official, and holding onto his power only temporarily, could not be considered a state official. The ruling bears on Prayut's eligibility to serve as prime minister.
Court rules that the monarchy reform is to overthrow the state and the monarchy.
On 10 November 2021, the court ruled that Arnon, Panupong, and Panusaya of the 2020–2021 Thai protests' 10-point call for reforms of the monarchy in 'Thammasat will not tolerate' rally on 10 August 2020 aimed to overthrow the state and the monarchy in their speeches. The court ordered them and other protest groups to end all monarchy reform movements. The petition was filed by Natthaporn Toprayoon on 3 September 2020.
The court explained that such demands were an "abuse of the rights and freedoms and harmed the state's security", but the court did not enforce a punishment on them, ruling on the constitutionality of their demands. Three protest leaders deny seeking to overthrow the monarchy. Evidence submitted by the defence was not examined by the court. Their lawyer and Panusaya walked out of the middle of hearing. The court also rules that sovereign power belongs to the monarchy not the people.
Sunai Phasuk of Human Rights Watch described the ruling as "essentially a judicial coup" that could escalate more legal cases against protesters, possibility treason. This could lead to an end to Thailand's constitutional monarchy rule and replacing with absolute monarchy. Jonathan Head of BBC described this ruling forcefully shuts down any room in Thailand for public discussion of the monarchy, but private discussion and social media discussion will continue on, regardless of the government efforts to stop. It was seen as another politicised intervention on the side of conservatives, royalists, by the independent court.
On 11 November 2021, the court website was hacked. Its homepage was renamed to the Kangaroo Court and a YouTube video of a song, "Guillotine (It goes Yah)" by Death Grips.
Same sex marriage.
In 2021, the court ruled that Section 1448 of the Civil and Commercial Code interpreting marriages as only between women and men is constitutional. The full text of the ruling says that members of the LGBTQ community cannot reproduce, as it is against nature, and that they are no different from other animals with unusual behaviours or physical characteristics. The text was deemed by some as sexist, politically incorrect and demeaning.
Prayut's term limit.
According to the 2017 constitution, the position of prime minister has a term limit of eight years. On 30 September 2022, the court ruled 6–3 that this term limit was counted from when the constitution was promulgated, which allowed Prayut Chan-o-cha to remain prime minister despite having held the position since coming to power in the 2014 coup.

Yeh Hui-Mei

Yeh Hui-Mei () is the fourth studio album by Taiwanese recording artist Jay Chou. It was released by Alfa Music on 31 July 2003, and was distributed throughout Asia in physical and digital formats. Chou enlisted various collaborators to assist with the album's lyrical content, including Vincent Fang, , Tseng Yu-ting, and Vivian Hsu, while Chou served as the album's sole composer. Named after the singer's mother, "Yeh Hui-Mei" utilizes genres such as pop, R&amp;B, and alternative rock, whilst containing influences from classical music, opera, and hip-hop. The record's production and visuals utilize both retro and contemporary elements.
The album received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its production and composition. "Yeh Hui-Mei" saw commercial success in various countries across Asia; in Singapore, it reached number one on the Recording Industry Association Singapore (RIAS) album chart upon release. In Taiwan, it was the best-selling album of 2003 with 335,000 copies sold, becoming Chou's third consecutive best-selling annual album after "The Eight Dimensions" (2002) and "Fantasy" (2001). "Yeh Hui-Mei" went on to sell over three million copies throughout Asia, and was certified gold by the RIAS.
"Yeh Hui-Mei" produced various singles—the track "In the Name of the Father" premiered on radio stations ahead of the album's release on 16 July, while the singles "Sunny Day" and "Dong-Feng-Po" were promoted after the album's release. Several of the record's other tracks were also featured in promotional campaigns in Greater China. At the 15th Golden Melody Awards, "Yeh Hui-Mei" won two awards out of eight nominations: Album of the Year, while the video for "Class 3-2" won Best Music Video. The album's other accolades include Most Popular Album of the Year the 4th Global Chinese Music Awards and the Asia Album Award at the 2004 Metro Radio Mandarin Hits Music Awards.
Background and development.
Chou assumed creative control over all aspects of "Yeh Hui-Mei", composing all of the tracks on the album and served as the executive producer and visual director. Alongside Chou and Vincent Fang, other musicians such as , Tseng Yu-ting and Vivian Hsu helped write the lyrical content for the record. Chou not only composed the songs and wrote the lyrics for three of them, but also served as the album's producer and stylist. In terms of the cover art, "Yeh Hui-Mei" added retro elements, and Chou also wore a retro suit to participate in the shooting.
Chou's musical philosophy in creating the album was to seek change. Out of his humanistic aspirations, Chou added different views and ideas to the album. The lead single "In the Name of the Father" was inspired by Chou's experience with his father. Chou's father, Chou Yiu-Chung, was an introvert and didn't talk much to Chou, so Chou wrote the song "In the Name of My Father" for him. The song "Class 3-2" was inspired by Jay's experience of playing pool with his friend Fang.
Writing and composition.
"Yeh Hui-Mei" carries a variety of styles, including vintage style, classical, opera, hip-hop and rock. The album is full of human, musical, experimental, satirical and social realism images that stimulate the flesh and blood of people.
"In the Name of the Father" is a song with a special mix of vintage music and piano, complemented by a fusion of Italian opera. The lyrics are based on "Godfather, Godfather, Father", explaining the Godfather's helplessness, the father's mercy, the selflessness of Godfather, etc., explaining that in order to reach a higher position, a person must give up some of the freedom and ideas he should have, but often behind the glory, he only gets lonely company. "Coward" utilizes a heavy metal rap rock music style, plus a rap chorus with children; the lyrics mainly use irony of drugs to express doubts and anger about those who are addicted to drugs and take drugs. "Sunny Day" is an intimate love song. "Class 3-2" is a medium-tempo R&amp;B song that uses the sound of ping-pong balls runs throughout. Chou imitates the style of ancient tunes with the song "Dong-Feng-Po," supplemented by the integration of erhu and pipa.
"You Hear Me" is a love song between lovers, speaking on how the secrets between them are only known to each other, and the love that depends on each other makes people reluctant to leave. "Same Tone" uses the sound of the pipa to create a Western classical atmosphere, and the interlude adds Argentine tango music to run through it. "Her Eyelashes" has the message that love has no fixed rules. "Love Cliff" has Chou and Vivian Hsu working together again; Hsu's way of writing lyrics shows that love is like a cliff, the deeper you love, the deeper you fall. "Terrace Field" uses an Aboriginal chorus, Chinese folk music and classical piano in the composition; the lyrics imply that people's destruction of the environment is cruel, and that the environment has been destroyed and the happiness of the past is gone forever. "Double Blade" expresses the Chinese being bullied in Chinatown, and their rebellion against the humble and peace-loving attitude of their parents, against the environment, and against inequality.
Release.
On 16 July 2003, the album's title and release date for 31 July was announced. On 19 July 2003, the album became available for pre-order with a free small oil painting of the album cover. The song "Same Tone" was used in a commercial for Pepsi-Cola. On 30 July 2003, Chou held a press conference for the release of the album in Taipei, Taiwan; at the press conference, the 13-minute movie version of "Double Blade" shot by Chou in the United States was also screened. It was reported that the album's pre-orders sold more than 1 million copies, bringing Chou 30 million Taiwan dollars in royalties. On 9 August 2003, Chou held a signing event in Ximending, Taipei that was attended by over 4,000 fans. 
On 20 August, the press conference for Chou's "2008--Beijing is Waiting for You" charity concert was held in Beijing; Sina Entertainment live-broadcast the press conference that allowed Chou to chat with his fans online for about half an hour. Chou attended the new album launch held at the Kowloonbay International Trade &amp; Exhibition Centre on 27 August 2003, and met with fans. On 31 August 2003, Chou signed autographs for fans at the "Jay Chou Yeh Hui-Mei CD Autograph Session" held at Fashion Walk in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. On the evening of 7 September 2003, Chou held a press conference at the Beijing Tianlun Dynasty Holiday Hotel for his concert "Beijing Looking Forward to You 2008" to be held at the Workers' Stadium on 12 September.
Title and artwork.
The album title uses the name of the singer's mother "Yeh Hui-Mei" because Chou thought that the title song of the album should be called "In the Name of the Father," so he used his mother's name as the album title for the sake of "balance." The album cover design of "Yeh Hui-Mei" features Chou donning a retro-style suit whilst sitting on a vintage chair and pays homage to the classic movie "The Godfather".
Singles and music videos.
On 16 July 2003, "In the Name of the Father" was premiered simultaneously on more than 50 radio stations across Asia, with an estimated 800 million people listening to it at the same time. Therefore, 16 July every year is designated as "Jay Chou Day." In order to match the song and image, Chou went to Rome to shoot the music video for "In the Name of the Father," which was directed by Kuang Sheng. The video tells the story of a child who grew up as a killer in a gangster family; one day, he suddenly discovered that the godfather who adopted him turned out to be the one who killed his biological father.
The music video for "Sunny Day" was filmed in Tamsui, New Taipei City, directed by and features actress Doris Lai. After seeing Lai's commercial, Chou selected her to play the heroine in the music video. When filming the video, Lai had just graduated from high school. In the video for "Sunny Day," Chou broke the habit of never kissing the heroine of the video, and made a breakthrough performance with 19-year-old Lai.

Clementi Road

Clementi Road () is a road in Singapore. Part of the wider AH2 road network, it starts at Bukit Timah Road and ends at West Coast Highway. Its landmarks include Maju Camp, the Singapore University of Social Sciences, Ngee Ann Polytechnic and National University of Singapore.
The road was once known as 'Reformatory Road' as there was a boys' home situated along the road. In 1947, the Singapore Rural Board discussed renaming the road. Their original intention was to name it after Sir Hugh Clifford, but it was eventually named as Clementi Road. It is generally suggested that the road was named after Sir Cecil Clementi Smith, who was the first British High Commissioner in the Straits Settlements. However, it is also possible that the road was named after Sir Cecil Clementi, another former Governor of the Straits Settlements (1930–33) who initiated the construction of the Kallang Airport.

Siege of Kagoshima

The 1587 siege of Kagoshima took place during Japan's Sengoku period, and was the last stand of the Shimazu family against the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. This was the final battle in Hideyoshi's campaign to take Kyūshū.
Following the Shimazu defeat at Sendaigawa, the Shimazu then retreated to their home castle of Kagoshima. Hideyoshi's forces numbering roughly 60,000, then made a landing, having set off from Akune. Under the leadership of Hashiba Hidenaga, Fukushima Masanori, Katō Kiyomasa, and Kuroda Yoshitaka, they then surrounded the city. The land-based divisions, which were not on the boats from Akune, had traversed the volcanic valleys defending the city with the help of local monks. In the end, however, negotiation precluded any fighting.

Kevin Francis (footballer, born 1967)

Kevin Derek Michael Francis (born 6 December 1967) is a former professional footballer who played as a striker. At , Francis was at one time the tallest player in the Football League. He is best known for his four-year spell at Stockport County, where he scored 117 goals.
Football career.
Early career.
Francis started his career at Mile Oak Rovers, before a big move to Derby County in 1989. He made 17 appearances for Derby, 15 as a substitute, scoring once in the FA Cup.
Stockport County.
Danny Bergara spotted Francis whilst he was playing a reserve match and immediately wanted to sign him. County paid Derby £45,000 in March 1991. He scored 5 goals as County finished as runner-up in Division Four. The following season, he notched 26 as County made it into two Wembley finals, followed by 33 in 1992–93 season as Stockport made it to the final of the Autoglass Shield. In his final full season he produced another 30 goals as County yet again made it to Wembley, however he was to lose for a fourth time. In 1994–95 he had already scored 13 times before he left Stockport in January 1995, for £800,000, a record at the time for County.
He did make a return to County in 2000, but it was short-lived as after just four appearances he broke his leg in a match versus Manchester City. He was released at the end of the season, a sad way to end his glorious County career.
Due to his excellent goal-scoring feats he earned the honour of "County Player of the Century" in 2002. Francis appeared back at Edgeley Park on 18 July 2014 as one of 30 Stockport County legends to play in Mike Flynn's testimonial match. Francis was welcomed back like a hero by the Stockport fans and stayed after the game to meet the fans.
Birmingham City.
In January 1995, Francis was signed for £800,000 by Barry Fry for his hometown club Birmingham City, and enjoyed a successful period, scoring 21 times in 94 appearances. This included the most successful season in his career, picking up a Division Two Champions medal as Birmingham secured promotion back to the 1st Division, and a winners medal in the Football League Trophy Final of the same season. Birmingham beat Carlisle United 1–0 at Wembley to secure a season double, with Francis finally breaking his Wembley duck after previously enduring four successive defeats with Stockport. Francis also played a major part in Birmingham's eventual promotion that season, scoring 8 times in the promotion run-in, (bringing his season tally to 21) including the first goal in a vital 2–0 home victory against second placed Brentford (only one team secured automatic promotion from the league that season).
Francis also played for Birmingham for a further two seasons in the 1st Division, although his time at St Andrews was disrupted by injury. Despite this, he played a major part in Birmingham's run to the League Cup Semi-Finals in the 95–96 season, scoring a brace as Birmingham eliminated Premiership Middlesbrough 2–0 in a 4th Round replay at St Andrews. He also opened the scoring with a 25-yard rocket in the Semi-Final 1st Leg at St Andrews against another Premier League side, Leeds Utd. Unfortunately for Francis and Birmingham, Leeds Utd came back to win the first leg 2-1 before securing a 3–0 victory in the second leg at Elland Road, to progress to the final on a 5-1 aggregate.
Later career.
Francis left Birmingham in 1998 moving to Oxford United, then Exeter City (for whom he scored once, against Lincoln City) and Hull City followed, before Francis exited the Football League and joined Hednesford Town. He finished his career off with spells at Redditch United and Studley before retiring in 2005.
Personal life.
Born in Birmingham, England, Francis played international football for Saint Kitts and Nevis, qualifying through his parents, who were both born in the country. He played his first international matches in the Caribbean Cup in April 1998.
He moved to Canada, where he worked as a police officer in Calgary, Alberta. He is married to Sharon, with whom he has two children, Stacey and Keisha. Stacey plays netball for England and West Coast Fever in Perth, Western Australia as a defender.

Mercenaries in India

Mercenaries in India were fighters, primarily peasants, who came from India and abroad, to fight for local rulers in India in the medieval period. This mercenary work became an important source of income for some communities.
During the 16th and 17th centuries, a number of mercenaries, arriving from several countries found employment in India. Some of the mercenaries emerged to become independent rulers.
Purbiyas and Pindaris.
In the medieval period, Purbiya mercenaries from Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh were a common feature in Kingdoms in Western and Northern India. They were also later recruited by the Marathas and the British. They also played a prominent role in the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Pindaris were irregular military men who were recruited by the elites of the Mughal Empire and the Deccan sultanates, and later by the Maratha Confederacy. They were disbanded in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.
African mercenaries in India.
The Siddi (pronounced [sɪd̪d̪iː]), also known as Sidi, Siddhi, Sheedi, or Habshi, are an ethnic group inhabiting India and Pakistan. Some were merchants, sailors, indentured servants, slaves and mercenaries. The Habshi or Siddis are thought to have arrived in India in 628 AD at the Bharuch port. Several others followed with the first Arab Islamic conquest of the subcontinent in 712 AD. The latter group are believed to have been soldiers with Muhammad bin Qasim's Arab army, and were called Zanjis.
Some Siddis escaped slavery to establish communities in forested areas, and some also established the small Siddi principalities of Janjira State on Janjira Island and Jafarabad State in Kathiawar as early as the twelfth century. A former alternative name of Janjira was Habshan (i.e., land of the Habshis). In the Delhi Sultanate period prior to the rise of the Mughals in India, Jamal-ud-Din Yaqut was a prominent Siddi slave-turned-nobleman who was a close confidant of Razia Sultana (1205–1240 CE). Although this is disputed, he may also have been her lover, but contemporary sources do not indicate that this was necessarily the case.
Siddis were also brought as slaves by the Deccan Sultanates. Several former slaves rose to high ranks in the military and administration, the most prominent of which was Malik Ambar.
European mercenaries in India.
Thousands of Europeans took up service at the courts of rulers all over India. These mercenaries for the most part came from the margins of their respective societies. During the first war between Bahamani Sultanate and Vijayanagara Empire, launched in 1365 by Muhammad Shah I, both sides imported their artillery guns and employed Turkish and European gunners to man them.
European mercenaries served in the courts of Indian rulers for 300 years, beginning with the large-scale defections of soldiers from Portuguese Goa in the 16th century, followed by a series of defections of British soldiers and laymen from the British East India Company bridgehead at Surat in the 17th century. During Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's first historic journey to India in 1498, he observed that there were Italian mercenaries in the employ of various "Rajahs" on the Malabar coast. Two of da Gama's own crewmen had left him to join the Italians in the service of a Malabar "Rajah" for higher wages.
Portuguese historian João de Barros stated that there were at least 2,000 Portuguese fighting in the armies of various Indian princes in 1565. Among these mercenaries included the indigenous Goan Christian and Bombay East Indian Christian soldiers and sailors. The Maratha ruler Shivaji employed many Portuguese and hundreds of Goans and Bombay East Indians in his navy, until they were persuaded by the colonial authorities in Goa to desert. They were generally sought after as artillery experts by the Mughals and Marathas. When the Mughals complained to the Portuguese viceroy António de Melo e Castro about the Portuguese soldiers serving under the Marathas, the latter responded with a letter stating he had no control over the Portuguese and native Christian officers in Shivaji's army, just as he had no control over the mercenaries serving in the Mughal and other armies.
During the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, so many Europeans took up service at the Mughal Army that a distinct suburb was built for them outside Delhi named Firingipura (Foreigners' Town). Its inhabitants included Portuguese, French and English mercenaries, many of whom had converted to Islam. These mercenaries formed a special "Firingi" (Foreigners') regiment, under the command of a Frenchman named Farrashish Khan. Shah Alam II gave the German mercenary Walter Reinhardt Sombre a large estate in the Doab, north of Delhi. Sombre settled in the estate with his wife Farzana Zeb un-Nissa, also known as Begum Samru, and made the village of Sardhana his capital. The ruling class of this principality was drawn from an assortment of Mughal noblemen, and 200 French Indian and Central European mercenaries, many of whom had converted to Islam. Sombre was succeeded after his death by his wife who took command of his mercenary troops and became the ruler of Sardhana, earning the distinction of being the only Roman Catholic ruler in India. Among these mercenaries was John-Augustus Gottlieb Cohen, a German Jewish mercenary who was the father of Urdu poet, Farasu.
There were many mercenaries working in the armies of the Deccan Sultanates who controlled much of central and southern India. One of the most prominent mercenaries in the Adil Shahi court was Gonçalo Vaz Coutinho, a Portuguese former landowner in Goa, who was imprisoned there on a murder charge before escaping to Bijapur in 1542. There he converted to Islam with his wife and children, and was given lands with great revenues by Ibrahim Adil Shah I. A Portuguese Jewish gunner by the name Sancho Pires, defected in similar circumstances to the Ahmadnagar Sultanate in 1530. Pires converted to Islam and took the name Firanghi Khan; acquiring a position of great influence in the Nizam Shahi court.
Many British renegades defected to the service of the Mughals and Deccan Sultanates during the 17th century, as in the case of Joshua Blackwell, a British East India Company official who in 1649 converted to Islam, and took up service in the Mughal army. Most of these renegades, like the trumpeter Robert Trulleye, however, went into the service of the Deccan Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda. In 1654, 23 British East India Company servants deserted Surat in a single mass break-out. In the 1670s, the authorities uncovered an active network of covert recruiting agents in British Bombay. By the 1680s, the increasing defections of British soldiers and East India Company servants led Charles II of England, to issue an order calling back all Englishmen in the employ of Indian princes.
During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a British convert to Islam named Abdullah Beg was one of the most active insurgents in old Delhi against British rule. Beg was a former Company soldier, who upon the arrival of the mutineer "sepoys" on 11 May, self-identified with them and virtually became a leader and advisor to the rebel forces in Delhi. He was last seen manning the rebel artillery along with another British defector and Muslim convert, Sergeant-Major Gordon. On account of his faith, Gordon was spared during the massacre of Christians at the outbreak of the uprising. In due course Gordon was taken to Delhi, where he manned the guns on the northern side of the city walls.

Goodwin College of Professional Studies

The Richard C. Goodwin College of Professional Studies is a higher education college at Drexel University, Philadelphia.
History.
Established shortly after the founding of Drexel as the Department of Lectures and Evening Classes, the College of Professional Studies has been a part of the school since 1892 under nine names. In 1896, the Department of Lectures and Evening Classes was renamed as the Department of Evening Courses. In 1918, during Hollis Godfrey's internal reorganization, it was renamed the Evening School. When degrees were offered through the school in 1924, it was renamed once again to the Evening Diploma School, from then it became known as the Evening College and Diploma School (1950–1965), and the Evening College (1965–1987). In 1987, it was renamed University College and remained that until it was merged with the Drexel University College of Arts and Sciences in 1993. In 1997, the college was brought back as the College of Evening and Professional Studies and underwent its last name change to the Goodwin College of Professional Studies in 2001 in honor of alumnus Richard C. Goodwin.
Goodwin's provides programs and services to part-time adult undergraduate, graduate, and lifelong learning individual and corporate consumers as well as traditional full-time undergraduates including credit and non-credit courses and programs and academically related services for the Philadelphia region, Northern California.
In fall 2008, Goodwin College merged with Drexel's School of Education. In conjunction with this merge, a new school was formed within Goodwin called the School of Technology &amp; Professional Studies, which includes the academic programs previously housed within Goodwin College prior the merge.
Included in this merge was The Math Forum, a web-based center for mathematics and mathematics education, which moved to Drexel in 2002 under the leadership of former university president Constantine Papadakis (1946–2009). The Math Forum is composed of teachers, mathematicians, researchers, students, and parents. They offer problems and puzzles; online mentoring; research; team problem-solving; collaborations; and professional development.
Shortly thereafter, the Center for the Prevention of School-Aged Violence and Drexel-Torrance Center for Creativity became part of Goodwin.

RK Celje

Rokometni klub Celje () or simply RK Celje, currently named Celje Pivovarna Laško () due to sponsorship reasons, is a professional handball club from Celje, Slovenia. They were the winners of the Champions League in the 2003–04 season, becoming European club champions by defeating German side SG Flensburg-Handewitt in the final. Celje play their home games at Zlatorog Arena with a capacity for 5,191 spectators.
History.
The first handball match in Celje was played in 1942. After World War II, handball became the most popular sport in this Slovenian town. By May 1945, there were already two established teams in Celje: Celje and Olimp. The two teams were city rivals and played multiple matches against each other. Therefore, the year 1946 is marked as the official beginning of handball in Celje.
In 1947, the two rival teams finally united to form a new, central sports society, Kladivar Sports Association. Among the 21 sports that were incorporated in this association, was the handball club. The first season of the national league began in 1949, and Celje won the first title amongst the competition of six other teams without a defeat. The winning streak continued until 1954; with an exception of a single draw against other Slovenian teams. The knowledge and skill of the game was successfully transferred from a former German national handball player and a World War II prisoner of war Fritz Knoffler, and thanks to him, the Celje handball club was already one of the best in former Yugoslavia. The first Yugoslavian league season, where Celje handball club participated, was in 1950. But nevertheless, interest in the sport of large arena handball was slowly dying down in the 1950s. Most of the teams then turned to a small arena handball, which was becoming increasingly popular. The first generation of Celje players started to practice small arena handball, and played their first game on concrete, on the open, in front of the local railway station. They played against Ljubljana handball club and won with staggering 43–4. In 1953, the first such league season in Yugoslavia had begun, but the Celje team only took a disappointing last place among the six teams. 
The Celje handball club wasn't so successful as anticipated, for they were playing in a regional league until 1961, when after two failed qualifications in 1959 and 1960, finally managed to enter the First Republic (Slovenian) League. With this event, the rise of the small arena handball (handball as we know it today) in Celje began.
In the meantime, talented players from the youngster team of Celje (such as Persinger, Telič, the Goršič brothers etc.) led by Jože Kuzma with the help of Tone Goršič and Franc Ramskugler had become 4 time consecutive vice-champions of the youngster First Republican League.
In the winter of 1964, the new city rivals-ŽRK Celje and Partizan Celje, unified once again under the name of ŽRK Celje. In the same year, ŽRK Celje became the Slovenian runners-up. One year later, they won the Slovenian national cup against their archrivals, Ljubljana, with the score of 17–11. In the 1965–66 season, Celje finally became the Slovenian republic first league champions, and after successful qualifications one season later in Slavonski Brod, finally became members of the elite Yugoslav Handball Championship. The maiden season in the first Yugoslavian league wasn't so successful, as Celje was relegated back to the republic league (the Slovenian First Republican league was basically the Yugoslavian second division), but managed to come back to the first league the following season. Jure Koren was the first Celje player who was drafted in the Yugoslavia national handball team. Celje managed to stay in the first division for three seasons, when it was once again relegated to a newly established Second Yugoslavian Federal Handball League in 1971. Tone Goršič and Franc Ramskugler created a new generation of players, such as Peunik, Luskar, Mrovlje and others, with the support of more experienced players such as Marguč, Koren, Levstik and Pučko. The Celje team was playing in the second division for four full seasons, gaining valuable experience and skill. The work on the young players had paid off, for in 1976, in the new Golovec Hall, Celje beat Velež Mostar in the qualifications, and once again became a member of the first division. The success of regaining a place amongst the elite obviously had a positive impact, because the Celje team managed to come to three Yugoslavian Cup finals, although all three of them were lost to Partizan in 1976, Medveščak in 1978 and Metaloplastika in 1980. The star of this successful team was Vlado Bojović, who was also successful in the national team, where he played 108 matches scoring 124 goals. He was the captain of the national team nine times, and participated on two world cups in 1978 and 1982. He was also part of the team on 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics, making him the most successful Slovenian player, who played for Celje. The youngster team of Celje, on the other hand, were already the first division champions in 1977, 1979, 1980 and 1982, and vice-champions in 1976, 1978, 1981, 1987 and 1988.
In 1978, the Slovenian company Aero Celje became the sponsor of the team. After two consecutive seventh places in the first division, Celje was again relegated in the 1978–79 season, came back in 1983–84 season, but was relegated back into the second division the same year. A seven-year crisis occurred, when Celje was struggling even in the second division until the season 1988–89, when they were preparing a new, better team, which would be capable of regaining a position in the first division.
In 1990, Pivovarna Laško became a new sponsor of the club and since then it has been called Celje Pivovarna Laško. In the 1990–91 season, the team won the second division and once again earned a promotion to the first Yugoslavian league. However, Slovenia declared its independence from Yugoslavia on 26 June 1991, and after a brief war, the Slovenian league was formed. In the first ten editions of the league between 1992 and 2001, Celje won the title every season. In the 2003–04 season, Celje became the European champions after defeating SG Flensburg-Handewitt in the final with an aggregate score 62–58 over two legs.

Career.
Musical career.
With his original band Gorky, De Vos ended third in Humo's Rock Rally in 1990. Together with Noordkaap, who won the same Rock Rally, he brought the genre of Dutch language rock music to the people's attention. After Gorky disbanded in 1993, Luc De Vos continued under the name Gorki. Stijn Meuris described the genre of Gorki's songs and De Vos's lyrics as "Flemish poetry with the boots in the clay" and "I have no clue what this guy was talking about, but I understood him".
Temporary side projects of De Vos include English language rock formation Automatic Buffalo which he started with the members of Ashbury Faith, and a solo tour in 2010.
With his bands Gorky/Gorki, he had 3 singles and 12 albums in the Flemish charts (the album charts only start in 1995, i.e. after his first albums were released). This included 5 top ten albums.
Writing career.
Luc De Vos wrote columns for, among others, Flemish radio station Studio Brussel and the Ghent city magazine "Zone 09/". He also wrote several books, the most recent of which, "Paddenkoppenland" ("Toadheadsland"), was described as an autobiography even though De Vos himself denied this.
Death.
Luc De Vos was found dead in the early evening of 29 November 2014 in his working apartment in Ghent. After an autopsy, both suicide and malicious intent were ruled out. The cause of death was concluded to be acute failure of vital organs. He left a wife and a son.
De Vos' public funeral at Saint Peter's Church in Ghent took place on Saturday 6 December 2014. Around 15,000 people assembled outside on the Saint Peter's Square as the church was full. He was buried in the famous Catholic cemetery of Campo Santo.
Legacy.
Luc De Vos's most famous song was "Mia". Though originally a B-side, it soon grew to be one of the most popular songs in Flanders, as well as gaining a cult following in the Netherlands, having been voted top of multiple radio station's lists of most timeless songs, including reaching the #1 spot three years in a row on "De Tijdloze 100", the best song of all-time list voted for by the listeners of Studio Brussel. The song has given its name to the MIA's, the music awards for Belgian artists.

The Polar Express (video game)

The Polar Express is an action-adventure platform game based on the film of the same name. It was developed by Blue Tongue Entertainment for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Microsoft Windows. A version for the Game Boy Advance was developed by Tantalus Media. All versions of the game were published by THQ. It was released in North America on November 2, 2004 and in Europe on December 16, 2004.
Gameplay.
The game follows most of the main plot of the film. One major difference is that the Ebenezer Scrooge Puppet, who only makes a minor appearance in the film, plays a much bigger role as the main antagonist who attempts to prevent the children from believing in Santa Claus by stealing their tickets, and trying to get them thrown off the train to keep the children from getting to the North Pole. The game is broken down into six chapters, giving the player the opportunity to explore areas like the train, the North Pole, and more. The player controls a young boy in each of the 6 chapters. The game also contains puzzle-solving as well as some minigame-styled elements.
The Game Boy Advance version is a 2D side-scrolling platformer which also has some levels where you control The Polar Express train itself in 3D.
Development.
THQ unveiled the game at the E3 convention in 2004. The PlayStation 2 version contains EyeToy support. A portable version of the game was also in development for the Game Boy Advance, by developer Tantalus.
Reception.
"The Polar Express" received "generally unfavorable" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.
Reviewing the console versions of the game for "GameSpot", Avery Score felt the experience was "a soulless video game cash-in on the movie" and that it would "leave even the youngest of tykes painfully aware that they've been cheated." "IGN"s Matt Casamassina was likewise very negative, finding every sort of gameplay featured was "flawed or underdeveloped" and criticizing its short length.
Dana Jongewaard, of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, was more positive about the game. While she conceded its short length and simplicity would make it a "questionable choice for anyone over 8," she thought that the game's target audience would enjoy it. She also complimented the bonus EyeToy content.
The Gameboy Advance version was also more positively received by "Nintendo Power", who praised it for its graphics and gameplay, and recommended it for fans of the film. On the other hand, this version was more negatively reviewed by "GameZone", who described it as "tired, worn out" and simply "no fun."

During the Quebec municipal reorganizations of 2002, it was amalgamated with the municipalities of Sainte-Marthe-du-Cap, Cap-de-la-Madeleine, Trois-Rivières, Trois-Rivières-Ouest and Pointe-du-Lac, to form the current town of Trois-Rivières.
History.
Founded in 1904, it had the status of a parish municipality from 1904 to 1993 and then a city from 1993 to 2002.

 ". . . It is argued that Saint-Louis-de-France (1214-1270) being the first holder of the former mission of the Vieilles-Forges (1740), to which Saint-Louis-de-France once belonged, renamed in 1921 Saint-Michel-Archange-des-Forges, sometimes Saint-Michel-Archange-des-Vieilles-Forges, it is for this reason that his name was transplanted to the parish on whose territory the Forges du Saint-Maurice began their activities in 1738. Canonized in 1297, Louis IX demonstrated a great spirit of peace and piety."
 . . . "However, account may also have been taken of the fact that the bishop of Trois-Rivières, Monseigneur Laflèche (1818-1898), to whom petitions were submitted to open a new parish, was Louis-François. According to another explanation, Saint-Louis-de-France would constitute a calque of Saint-Louis-des-Français, name of the French national church of Rome."

Burnt offering (Judaism)

A burnt offering in Judaism (, "qorban ʿōlā") is a form of sacrifice first described in the Hebrew Bible. As a tribute to God, a burnt offering was "entirely" burnt on the altar. This is in contrast to other forms of sacrifice (entitled "zevach" or "zevach shelamim"), which was "partly" burnt and "most" of it eaten in communion at a sacrificial meal.
During the First Temple and Second Temple periods, offerings took place twice daily offered on the altar as a burnt animal 
in the temple in Jerusalem that was completely consumed by fire. The skin of the animal, however, was not burnt but given to the priests respective of their priestly division. These skins are listed as one of the twenty-four priestly gifts in Tosefta Hallah (or Tosefta Challah).
Etymology.
The Hebrew noun "olah" (עֹלָה) occurs 289 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible. It means "that which goes up [in smoke]". It is formed from the active participle of the verb "alah" (עָלָה), "to cause to ascend." It was sometimes also called "kalil", an associated word found in Leviticus, meaning "entire".
Its traditional name in English is "holocaust", and the word "olah" has traditionally been translated as "burnt offering." The term was translated as "holocauston" in the Septuagint. Today, some English Bible translations render the word as "holocaust", and others translate it as "burnt offering". For example, Exodus a is translated in the New American Bible as "Then Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, brought a holocaust and other sacrifices to God", while it is translated in the New International Version as "Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God".
In classical rabbinical literature, there are several different etymologies given for the term "olah", though all agree that it literally translates as "(that which) goes up". Some classical rabbis argued that the term referred to "ascent of the mind" after making the sacrifice, implying that the sacrifice was for atonement for evil thoughts, while others argued that it was a sacrifice "to the highest", because it is entirely intended for God. Modern scholars, however, argue that it simply refers to the burning process, as the meat "goes up in flames".
Hebrew Bible.
In Biblical narrative.
The first uses of the "olah" for burnt offering refer to the sacrifices of Noah "of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar", and to the near-sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham: "offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains". Another burnt-offering is that of Jethro, Moses' father-in-law ().
The Nevi'im section of the Hebrew Bible, particularly passages in the Book of Judges, presents the practice of the burnt offering. In the story of Gideon, a slaughter offering of a young goat and unleavened bread is consumed by fire sent from heaven. In the story of Samson's birth, his father, who was intending to make a slaughter offering so that he could give a meal to an angel, is told by the angel to burn it completely instead.
Procedure.
Initially, the burnt-offering was required to be offered on an "altar of earth". After the tabernacle was built, it was specified that the tabernacle's altar be used.
The major types of sacrificial offerings, their purpose and circumstances, details of their performance and distributions afterwards are delineated in the Book of Leviticus 1:1-7:38.
The animals were required to be "unblemished"; the list of blemishes includes animals "that are blind or broken or maimed, or have an ulcer or eczema or scabs". The animals were brought to the north side of the altar, and ritually slaughtered. The animal's blood was carefully collected by a priest and sprinkled on the outside corners of the altar. Unless the animal was a bird, its carcass was flayed, with the skin kept by the priests.
The flesh of the animal was divided according to detailed instructions given by the Talmud (Tamid 31), and would then be placed on the wood on the altar (which was constantly on fire due to the large number of sacrifices carried out daily), and slowly burnt. After the flesh (including any horns and goats' beards) had been reduced to ashes, usually the following morning, the ashes were removed by a Kohen, as refuse, and taken to a ritually clean location outside the Temple.
The burnt-offering was offered together with a meal offering and a drink offering, whose quantities depended on the variety of animal being offered (bull, ram, sheep, or goat).
Occasions.
The schedule of obligatory sacrifices, including burnt-offerings, appears in the Book of Numbers 28:1-30:1. These include daily offerings, as well as additional offerings for Shabbat, Rosh Chodesh, Rosh Hashanah, Passover, Shavuot, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot. The sacrificial animals were required to be bulls, rams, goats (as sin offerings) and lambs.
A "korban olah" was also made as a sin offering on the appointment of a priest, on the termination of a Nazirite's vow, after recovery from "tzaraath", by a woman after childbirth, after recovery from a state of abnormal bodily discharges, a gentile's conversion to Judaism, or as a voluntary sacrifice, when the sacrificial animal could be a young bull, ram, year-old goat, turtle doves, or pigeons.
In Hellenistic Judaism.
The Septuagint mainly translates the Hebrew "olah" with the common Greek term "holokaustos", a traditional Greek religious practice in which the sacrificial victim was reduced to ash rather than parts consumed in a meal; for example, in Genesis 22:2, Isaac is to be sacrificed "as a holocaust" (Greek: εἰς ὁλοκάρπωσιν). Josephus uses the term both for Abraham and Isaac, but also in relation to the human sacrifice by Ahaz of his son to Baal. The practice is also referenced by Philo, but with significant changes.
In Rabbinic Judaism.
Chazal sources, 3rd-6th century CE, portray the "olah" form of sacrifice, in which no meat was left over for consumption by the Kohanim, as the greatest form of sacrifice and was the form of sacrifice permitted by Judaism to be sacrificed at the Temple by the Kohanim on behalf of both Jews and non-Jews.
The priestly gifts.
Unless the offering was a bird ("olat haof"), its corpse was flayed. The skin of the offering was then kept by the priests who were serving their shift as part of the rotation of the priestly divisions. The Tosefta narrates that, as time evolved, more powerful priests forcibly took possession of the skins from the lesser priests. Subsequently, it was decreed by the Beth din shel Kohanim (the court of the priests in Jerusalem) that the skins should be sold, with the monetary proceeds being given to the Temple in Jerusalem (Tosefta 19).
Modern scholarship.
Some passages in the Book of Judges show the principle and practice of whole offerings; in the story of Gideon, a slaughter offering of a young goat and unleavened bread is destroyed when fire sent from heaven consumes it; in the story of Samson's birth, his father, who was intending to make a slaughter offering so that he could give a meal to an angel, is told by the angel to burn it completely instead.
The burnt offering is believed to have appeared as an extreme form of the slaughter offering, whereby the portion allocated to the deity increased to all of it. In slaughter offerings, the portion allocated to the deity was mainly the fat, the part which can most easily be burnt (fat is quite combustible); scholars believe it was felt that the deity, being aethereal, would appreciate aethereal food more than solid food—the burning of the fatty parts of animals being to produce smoke as a "sweet savour" for the deity.

WFMK

WFMK (99.1 FM) is an adult contemporary radio station licensed to East Lansing, Michigan and serving the Lansing radio market. The station is owned by Townsquare Media and broadcasts in HD radio. WFMK is one of the oldest adult contemporary stations, as it has been carrying the format for almost 5 decades. The station also switches to an all-Christmas music format, temporarily replacing its AC format from mid-November through December.
The Studios are on Pine Tree Road and its transmitter is near downtown Lansing. WFMK operates with an ERP of 28,000 watts, making it a class B radio station.
History.
WSWM was founded in 1959 by John P. McGoff who sold the station to Robert G. Liggett Jr. owner of Liggett Communications in 1971. Liggett changed the station's call sign to WFMK, and initially programmed a mix of Adult Contemporary music as "Stereo Island, WFMK 99" during the day (using the "Stereo Island" approach pioneered at WKNR-FM in Detroit), and Album Oriented Rock overnight. The AOR portion of the format was dropped in the mid-1970s, and the Adult Contemporary format expanded to 24 hours a day, under the moniker "Easy Rockin' FM 99".
Over the years WFMK's adult contemporary format has evolved to the point that the station's current slogan is "A Variety From the '80s to Now." WFMK has long been one of the most popular and most highly rated stations in the Lansing area.
When WHZZ in Lansing, Michigan abruptly changed format from Contemporary Hit Radio to Adult Hits in 2005, WFMK, along with WQHH and WJXQ temporarily took advantage of the format switch, touting the many CHR artists on the station until WFMK's sister station, WJIM-FM changed format from oldies to CHR a few days later.
On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Townsquare Media would acquire 53 Cumulus Media stations, including WFMK, for $238 million. The deal is part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare and Dial Global are both controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013 and WFMK came under the Townsquare ownership.
Christmas Music.
Each year, WFMK switches to all Christmas music for the holiday season. The tradition began in 2010 when the station flipped to the format 24/7 for the first time. The Christmas Music usually begins the week before Thanksgiving and continues through Christmas Day. This Christmas format competes with WXLA, which also goes all-Christmas for the season.
Jingle.
WFMK has had its jingle melody changed over the years. During the mid and late 1980s, WFMK's jingles were by JAM Creative Productions and used the WENS melody. In the 1990s, WFMK's jingles, by TM Century, also used the WENS melody, which also was the call sign melody for WMXV. WFMK's jingle melody was changed again when the station began using the "Cuddle" jingle package from Thompson Creative; this package remained for seven years. The most recent jingle melody change came in 2007 when WFMK began using Reelworld's 2007 WLIT jingle package; WFMK has stayed with Reelworld and the WLIT melody ever since. Their current jingle package to this day is Reelworld One AC and the KVIL package, both using the same WLIT melody.

Novaggio

Novaggio is a former municipality in the district of Lugano, in the canton of Ticino, Switzerland. On 6 April 2025, the former municipalities of Astano, Bedigliora, Curio, Miglieglia and Novaggio merged to form the new municipality of Lema.
History.
Novaggio is first mentioned in 1244 as "Novagio".
Graves found in Pazz and Traversagna suggest a nearby Iron Age settlement. In the Early Middle Ages the monastery of S. Abbondio of Como owned property in the village, while the Como Cathedral owned a farm and mill near Novaggio. In 1294, the Humiliati monastery of Astano owned a house and property in the village. At that time Novaggio, Curio, Banco and Bedigliora formed a "kastlanei". There were certainly several fortifications around the village, but the exact location, number and type is unknown.
The Church of S. Siro was first mentioned in 1352, and was a parish church since 1632. The current building dates from 1625. At the end of the 19th century, a local family founded Evangelical parish. In 1902 they built a church established an evangelical school. In 1905, Doctor Fausto Buzzi-Cantone, built Villa Alta. His partner, Alice Meier, opened a small hospital where the residents of Novaggio were provided free medical care in the park of the villa. Later the villa was bought by the Confederation, which set up a military hospital, in 1922.

Expoland

Expoland, located in Suita, Japan was opened as the amusement zone at the International Exposition in 1970 (Expo '70) in Osaka and thrived for over 30 years as an amusement park. There were more than 40 rides and attractions (including eight roller coasters) and 19 restaurants and shops. The park was permanently closed in 2009.
On May 5, 2007, Fujin Raijin II, the park's TOGO stand-up coaster, derailed, killing Yoshino Kogawara, a 19-year-old university student from Higashiomi, Shiga and injuring an additional nineteen guests. Initial reports said that forty people were injured, with thirty-one being taken to hospital. An investigation revealed that the ride derailed due to a broken axle, of which none had been replaced for fifteen years. Following this accident, similar coasters at other Japanese parks were voluntarily shut down and inspected to see if they could also have the same axle flaw. Expoland was cited by authorities for faulty maintenance when similar axle cracks were found on a second train a month later.
The park reopened after the accident but closed again on December 9, 2007, citing a lack of attendance. On February 9, 2009, its owners decided to close the park down permanently.

History.
Origlio is first mentioned in 1335 as "Orellio".
In the Middle Ages, the village, was part of the valley community of Lugano. In 1484 it was ravaged by the plague. In the 15th century it was under the Duke of Milan, to whom it had to provide soldiers and weapons. Under Swiss Confederation rule, it was part of the bailiwick of Lugano. In 1803, after the Act of Mediation, it became part of the district of Lugano.
The first church in the village dates from the 8th century. The church of San Vittore Mauro in Carnago was built on the site of this earlier church. In 1570 it became a parish church. A duty was shared after 1812, with the church of SS Giorgio and Maria Immacolata, which dates back to the 17th century. Its interior contains a number of frescoes and stucco work.

Royal Air Force roundels

The air forces of the United Kingdom – the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm, the Army's Army Air Corps and the Royal Air Force use a roundel, a circular identification mark, painted on aircraft to identify them to other aircraft and ground forces. In one form or another, it has been used on British military aircraft from 1915 to the present.
Background.
When the First World War started in 1914 it was the habit of ground troops to fire on all aircraft, friend or foe, so that the need for some form of identification mark became evident. At first the Union Flag was painted under the wings and on the sides of the fuselage. It soon became obvious that at a distance the St George's Cross of the Union Flag was likely to be confused with the Iron Cross that was already being used to identify German aircraft. After the use of a Union Flag inside a shield was tried it was decided to follow the lead of the French who used a tricolour cockade (a roundel of red and white with a blue centre). The British reversed the colours and it became the standard marking on Royal Flying Corps aircraft from 11 December 1914, although it was well into 1915 before the new marking was used with complete consistency.
The official order stated:
The Royal Naval Air Service specified in A.I.D. SK. No. A78 a five-foot red ring with a white centre and a thin white outline on the lower surfaces of the lower wings at mid span, from October 1914 until it was decided to standardise on the RFC roundel for all British military aircraft in June 1915.
With the same roundel being carried by RFC and RNAS aircraft, the use of the Union Jack was discontinued. The Royal Flying Corps and its successor the Royal Air Force have employed numerous versions of the roundel since then.
By 1917, a thin white outline was usually added to the roundel, to make the blue of the outer circle easier to distinguish from the dark PC.10 and PC.12 protective dope. On squadrons operating at night there was not the same need to make the marking more conspicuous, indeed it became customary to overpaint the white ring of the roundel itself, either in the camouflage finish of the aircraft as a whole, or in red. By the end of the war this had become standardised as the so-called "night roundel" of blue and red, which continued to be used on the dark NIVO green camouflage of post-war night bombers. Most RAF aircraft now had a silver finish (either bare metal or aluminium dope) so that the national markings were conspicuous enough without outlining. During the late 1930s RAF and Fleet Air Arm (FAA) aircraft were once again camouflaged, and a new outline was introduced, this time trainer yellow, and the same width as the blue and white rings.
Use by other air arms.
Aside from the RAF, the Royal Navy's Royal Naval Air Service (First World War) and later the Fleet Air Arm as well as the air elements of the British Army all adopted the same roundels.
Many nations which had been within the British Empire and Commonwealth continued to use British roundels despite having achieved independence, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and India until nationalism demanded unique roundels for each of those countries.
South Africa experimented with briefly, but then reverted to the RAF roundel but replaced the , and then the dot with a before replacing the disk with a .
In Canada, the Royal Canadian Air Force changed the red dot into a , while the Royal Canadian Navy adopted the and both were replaced with a .
Australia changed the red dot to a (both standing and running were proposed before the running variant won out) and New Zealand experimented with gold, green and white ferns inset in the red dot before settling on a .
India briefly replaced the SEAC roundel (blue on blue) with a blue and white chakra, before adopting an .
Southern Rhodesia, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and Rhodesia used variations on the British roundel featuring "assegais" before adopting a green ring with a lion and tusk on a white centre in 1970.
Roundel history.
The use of letters (A, B, C, D) to denote different versions of roundels does not come from official documents, but rather from attempts by historians in the 1950s to catalogue the various roundels being used. Official documents instead provided dimensions in inches. Since most sources now use this nomenclature it has been included here.
Roundel sizes.
Pre-war.
Up until mid-1938, roundel sizes tended to vary widely, depending on the type of aircraft; the exception to the use of type A roundels for all aircraft was seen on the overall NIVO (a dark grey-green finish with a sheen) painted night bombers (e.g., Handley Page Heyfords) which used type B roundels. Roundels used on aircraft painted in NIVO were duller than the normal colours. The size of the roundel was generally determined by the space available at the specified location, with a space of several inches around the edges. Some aircraft – primarily seaplanes, had a white outline around the fuselage roundel, even on silver doped finishes however this application was inconsistent so was probably not official. From 1929, the RAF switched to a new system of colour specifications, discarding the one used since the First World War, and as a result, the colour used for insignia changed, however the changeover period appears to have extended until at least 1932 for new production, and the old colours were not overpainted, but only gradually phased out as aircraft needed to be repainted.
During the Munich crisis of mid- to late 1938, most RAF aircraft adopted green and dark earth camouflage with type B roundels of reduced sizes on all upper surfaces and the fuselage sides; though based on colour photos, these remained in the bright pre-war colours. FAA aircraft largely remained silver doped overall with type A roundels predominating. To illustrate the progression up to the end of the war the Spitfire will be used as a typical single seat-single engine fighter:
1938 – November 1939: The first production batches of Spitfires (aircraft registrations K9787-K9814) were built with roundels on the fuselage sides-these were centred aft of the rear edge of the cockpit door. type A1s were on the upper wings. From K9815, the fuselage roundels were moved back, to be centred aft of the cockpit door and above the main longeron, and reduced in diameter to type A1. This position for the fuselage roundel was subsequently standard on all Supermarine and Westland built Spitfires and Seafires. The first 180 or so built (K9787–K9960) also had factory applied type A roundels under the wings. After K9960, there were "no factory applied" under-wing roundels until December 1940. With the change to type B roundels Spitfires built with type A.1 roundels had were repainted by the squadrons creating a plethora of sizes and proportions.
Between K9961 and N3032, the factory paint scheme required type B roundels on the fuselage sides and a roundel with a red centre on the upper wings. From N3033–P9374, it was intended that type B fuselage roundels would be used, although few Spitfires saw service with roundels of this size.
Most RAF aircraft went through similar transitions, as a result of which there was little conformity, depending on when the aircraft was built and how squadrons over painted or repainted the roundels.
Second World War.
By the beginning of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, RAF roundel sizes started to show more conformity. On 30 October, all commands were ordered to change upper wing surface Type B roundels to Type A. Further instructions ordered all but fighters and night bombers to have Type A under the wing tips. This was clarified in November to the effect that only reconnaissance maritime aircraft (e.g., Short Sunderland flying boats) would have the Type A on the upper wings but all aircraft would use the Type B on the sides.
A decision was made to make roundels more conspicuous and, in May 1940, the yellow outer ring was ordered to be added back to fuselage sides (along with red, white, and blue stripes on the fin). Where possible, the yellow should be the same width as the blue, but on Spitfires with their narrower fuselages a thinner ring was acceptable. Also in May, an order was made to put red, white, and blue roundels on the underwings of all fighters, with an addendum that where the roundel was on a black background it should be outlined in yellow. In June, orders were given for the half black/half-white underwing scheme to be replaced by "sky" Underwing roundels were dispensed with until August when they were ordered back.
Because of the pressures of front-line service there were always exceptions to the standards set by the RAF and that deadlines were not necessarily met. Although type C and C.1 roundels were meant to be in use by July 1942 some Spitfires displayed type A and A1 roundels as late as October:
Although the Spitfire is used as one example, because it was one of the few British aircraft to see front-line service before, during and after the Second World War, other aircraft types went through similar transitions. During the transition from A type to C type roundels some Hawker Typhoons displayed type C1 roundels which were modified from type A1s.
After June 1940 the official sizes for roundels were:
Many variations could be seen because of the problems involved in interpreting instructions or repainting aircraft in front-line service, but most production aircraft conformed to these basic dimensions.
SEAC and RAAF.
In the China/Burma/India (CBI) theatre and Pacific it was thought that the red centres of RAF roundels could be confused with the red "hinomaru" carried by Japanese aircraft. After an RAAF No. 11 Squadron Catalina was mistaken for a Japanese aircraft by a US Navy Wildcat in the Pacific Theatre and attacked, the roundels on RAAF were modified, mostly in the field, by painting over the red with white. Often the yellow outer rings of type A1 roundels were left intact. No British or American built aircraft had factory painted SEAC style roundels; all aircraft had to be repainted, and, in many cases re-camouflaged by Maintenance Units behind the lines or by front line squadrons.
When Spitfire Mk VCs reached the CBI Theatre in November 1943 their type B, C and C1 roundels were all modified by painting out the red centre spots in white, the red of the fin flash was similarly painted over. When the Mk VIIIs arrived in early 1944 most of them had their roundels overpainted completely and replaced by diameter SEAC roundels with light blue centre spots (a mix of dull roundel blue and white) of approximately diameter. The fin flashes were replaced by high by wide versions, each light blue (leading edge) and roundel blue stripe being wide.
Mk VC Spitfires used by the Royal Australian Air Force over Northern Australia in October 1943 had their 36-inch type C1 fuselage roundels modified to SEAC roundels by painting out the yellow outer ring in the camouflage colours and over-painting the red centre in white. The lower wing type C roundels and upper wing type Bs were also modified by over-painting the red centres in white. The red fin stripe was also painted out with white and, in many cases the blue was extended forward making equal widths of . RAAF Mk VIIIs had their roundels and fin flashes modified in the same ways, although some had their upper wing roundels overpainted and replaced with SEAC roundels.
Fin flash.
All current Royal Air Force aircraft carry a flash on the fin. This is either red/white/blue, or red/blue, the latter normally being used on camouflaged aircraft, with the red stripe forward. Aircraft painted anti-flash white in the nuclear strike role had a pale pink and blue flash, the same shades as the roundels, to reflect some of the thermal radiation from a nuclear explosion.
The Royal Navy and Army do not use the fin flash but have the words "ROYAL NAVY" or "ARMY" on the rear fuselage or fin instead. An exception to this was the Harrier GR7s and GR9s of the Naval Strike Wing, which carried similar markings to RAF Harriers. The fin flash can be rectangular, slanted or tapered, depending on aircraft type.
In a situation similar to that of the roundels, the fin flash was also shared with the air forces of Australia and New Zealand.
The fin flash evolved from the rudder stripes painted on the rudders of early RFC and RAF aircraft during the First World War, the markings being blue, white and red vertical stripes on the rudder. The fin flash of RNAS, RFC and RAF aircraft of the First World War was applied with the blue stripe forward. This orientation continued through to the late 1920s when it was reversed to have the red stripe forward in the order used through WW2 up to the present day. When applied to night bomber aircraft the red/blue fin flash was also blue forward through this period.
With the performance of aircraft increasing considerably during the 1930s, the practice of applying painted markings onto the (then manually powered) control surfaces was generally discontinued because of the need to rebalance the controls – failure to do this could have adverse effects on the surface's balance, possibly leading to flutter of the control surface at high airspeeds. It was for the same reason that the positioning of the wing roundels was revised so that they no longer encroached upon the ailerons.
In an attempt to conform to the appearance of French military aircraft, rudder stripes reappeared on aircraft (mainly Fairey Battles and Hawker Hurricanes) of the RAF based in France, starting in early September 1939. These stripes were painted in standard RAF colours in the order blue, white, red.
Fin flashes were officially adopted in June 1940. For the first six months there was no conformity in the width or height of the stripes and they were painted to cover as much of the fin area as possible. With occasional exceptions the order was red (leading edge), white, blue. In December 1940 type A fin flashes were standardised with a height of , and an overall width of , divided into three red, white and blue stripes (e.g.: photo six, the Sea Hurricanes show this standardised fin flash). On some aircraft, e.g.; photo reconnaissance Spitfires the fin flash was about half these dimensions.
In July 1942, with the adoption of the type C and C1 roundels the fin flash became a square for RAF fighters, the stripe widths becoming red, white and blue. There were some exceptions; RAF North American Mustangs all used fin flashes which were high by wide. In early 1944 some aircraft types were painted in a "High-altitude" camouflage scheme and adopted type B roundels and fin flashes.
The then-current RAF fin flashes were also adopted for USAAF aircraft operating alongside British and Commonwealth forces in the Mediterranean theatre in 1942, appearing on US Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighters and North American B-25 Mitchell bombers, as well as on USAAF Consolidated B-24 Liberators flying from North Africa on attacks such as 1943's Operation Tidal Wave.
Colours.
Roundel and fin-flash colours changed several times during the First World War because of severe problems with fading. The third standard (VB3 and VR3) would be used until the early 1930s when much brighter colours replaced the red and blue at the same time that rudder stripes were omitted. The red and blue were both duller and less saturated than later versions and varied considerably as paint was usually mixed locally. The actual switchover began in 1929 but new aircraft were still being delivered in 1932 with the earlier colours.
For the period from the early 1930s until 1938, Roundel Red was close to FS 595 21136 and the Roundel Blue was slightly lighter and brighter than FS 595 15056. Trainer Yellow was close to FS 595 23538.
Photo 2, a restored Bristol F.2 Fighter is a fairly good representation of the late interwar colours. On fabric covered aircraft these were glossy (as was the general finish) until dulled with age, even during the First World War.
In 1938, with the threat of war looming, new markings colours were introduced along with camouflage. The blue was darker, becoming similar to FS 595 25050 while the red became a slightly brownish brick-red, about FS 595 20109. The trainer yellow stayed the same shade but all colours were now matte. These colours remained standard for another eight years. To further complicate matters, old stocks continued to be used up. A series of colour photos of a Miles Master show wing and fuselage roundels (C and C1) in dull colours, while the fin flash remains in the bright pre-war colours, albeit with the later proportions. Other colour photos show a mixture of bright and dull colours being used on the same insignia, though all instances found have been of trainers.
Post-war colours were specified by the new BS 381 colour standard and approximate the late pre-war colours except for special cases, such as anti-flash markings and the current low visibility markings. The old blue colour, Aircraft Blue on BS381c was BS108. A new colour BS110, Roundel blue, made on Phthlalocyanine blue, was introduced in the early 1960s to improve weather fastness.
In popular culture.
Roundels in general and the RAF roundel in particular have been associated with pop art of the 1960s, appearing in paintings by Jasper Johns and British artist Sir Peter Blake. It became part of the pop consciousness when British rock group The Who wore RAF roundels (and Union Flags) as part of their stage apparel at the start of their career. Subsequently it came to symbolise Mods and the Mod revival. The roundel is often used on clothing of the Ben Sherman brand.

Paradiso, Ticino

Paradiso is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. It lies on the shore of Lake Lugano and, although administratively independent of the city of Lugano, it is surrounded on all other sides by that city.
History.
Paradiso is first mentioned in 1335 as "Calprino". In 1835 it was first called "Paradiso" from a district of the village, though that didn't become the official name until 1929, also to avoid confusion with the hamlet of Caprino, across the lake.
Excavations in 1951 in Calprino discovered evidence of a Roman era settlement in the area. In the 7th century, there was a small Langobard settlement in the same area. The settlement of Morchino goes back to the 8th century, while Calprino, Fontana and Guidino are each mentioned between the 12th and 14th centuries. In 1040 the Benedictine monastery S. Carpoforo owned land in Calprino. Between 1264 and 1375, they owned extensive lands and an episcopal fief in the village. In the 12th century, the Benedictine Abbey S. Ambrogio in Milan owned land in Guidino. By about 1335, the settlements that now make up Paradiso, formed part of the Council of "sancti Petri di Pamio". The Council existed until the 19th century and administered the community properties.
The church of Paradiso was the parish of Pambio. The Chapel of Beata Vergine alla Geretta has been occupied since the 16th century.
The village economy was based on agriculture, mostly grain and vineyards. Then, in the 18th and 19th century, the silk industry entered the village. Thanks to the views over Lake Lugano, Paradiso became a popular holiday resort after the opening of the Gotthard Railway in 1882. The funicular railway up Monte San Salvatore opened in 1890. The funicular and increasing lake traffic contributed to the further development of the hotel and tourism industry in Paradiso. At the same time, the population grew. The construction of the highway along the municipal border with Lugano in 1966 began to change the character of the municipality. At the beginning of the 21st century, tourism began to decline and Paradiso began to develop into a residential community with many luxury buildings.

Exning

Exning is a village and civil parish in the West Suffolk district of Suffolk in eastern England.
It lies just off the A14 trunk road, roughly east-northeast of Cambridge, and south-southeast of Ely. The nearest large town is Newmarket.
The most conspicuous building in Exning is the Church of St Martin, which is visible from the A14.
History.
Local lore reputes Exning to have been the capital of the Iceni tribe and therefore the home of Queen Boadicea (Boudica).
"The Island", a moated earthworks to the south of the parish is no longer visible following the building of the Newmarket bypass (originally part of the A45, before being redesignated the A14 in 1973. This led to the destruction of the site and its consequential delisting as a scheduled monument. However the site was examined before its destruction.
Exning is reputed to have been the birthplace of Saint Ethelreda, to whom Ely Cathedral is dedicated, though this is disputed.
A spring at Exning was named St Wendreda's Well, and a local legend had it that the seventh-century Saint Wendreda used its water for healing. Newmarket jockeys used to take horses there to drink before a race.
At the time of William the Conqueror, Exning was in Staploe Hundred. Later, the settlement was in the Liberty of Ely. When the powers of the Liberty were reduced, some of its territory returned to Suffolk, including Exning – albeit as a part of Lackford Hundred, where it would remain until the Victorian period. For several centuries, the part of Suffolk centred on Exning was almost an enclave of the county within the confines of Cambridgeshire. The parish of Newmarket All Saints was transferred from Cambridgeshire to this virtual enclave in 1894, but it continued to be practically detached until boundary changes in the area widened considerably the "bridge" between it and the rest of Suffolk a hundred years later.
The Rosery Hotel is an early Victorian building which was frequently visited by Queen Mary.
During the Second World War, the headquarters of No. 3 Group of RAF Bomber Command were located in Harraton House. Nearby Newmarket Heath, the northwest corner of which borders on Exning, was used as an airfield, RAF Newmarket, for, amongst others, Stirling III Bombers of No. 75 (NZ) Squadron RAF. Little evidence remains of this chapter in Exning's history, apart from a single aircraft hangar on Heath Road, Burwell (near the One Thousand Guineas Connect service station on the A14 trunk road) and a memorial plaque on the racecourse.

Ponte Capriasca

Ponte Capriasca is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
Ponte Capriasca is first mentioned in 1335 as "Ponte". In 1491 it was mentioned as "Ponte Criviascha".
Historically, it was part of bailiwick of Lugano. Under the rule of the Duchy of Milan as well as the Swiss Confederation, the village was an independent municipality with its own statutes and rights. The rights and statutes were first documented in 1443 and were confirmed in 1648. Early in the 16th century, the village was involved in the fierce fighting between the Guelphs and Ghibellines.
In 1455, it separated from the Tesserete parish to form an independent parish. The parish church of S. Ambrogio is first mentioned in 1356 but is built on a Roman era foundation. Its present form dates from a rebuilding of 1835, in which the old bell tower and the nave were incorporated. The Last Supper in the interior dates from the 16th century and was modeled on Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper. The painting was restored in 1951 and again in 1989–92.
The local economy of the village was based on agriculture and the income from the seasonal migration, especially to northern Italy. From the 1970s the village experienced a building boom and its population increased fivefold. In 2005 slightly over half of the jobs are in the service sector and over three-quarters of the population are commuters.

ASD Licata Calcio

Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Licata Calcio is an Italian association football club located in Licata, Sicily.
Licata is a historical Sicilian team, and one of the six Sicilian football clubs to have ever reached the Serie B league in Italian football history.
The club currently plays in Serie D.
History.
The club was founded in 1931 as Associazione Calcio Licata by a few local students who discovered the game of association football thanks to some Swedish sailors who worked in the area; the official team colours, in fact, refer to the flag of Sweden. The club was renamed Polisportiva Licata in 1967.
The first appearance of Licata in a professional league, is dated in 1982 within Serie C2. During the 1984–85 season, Licata, coached by a young Zdeněk Zeman, won Serie C2 and was promoted to Serie C1, despite a team composed almost entirely by players from the youth squad.
In 1988, with Aldo Cerantola as coach, Licata won also Serie C1/B, and was promoted to Serie B for the first time in the club's history. During its first season in the Italian second division, with Giuseppe Papadopulo as a coach, then replaced by Francesco Scorsa, Licata ended in ninth place; finishing above Parma. They also achieved the honor of playing a Coppa Italia match at the Stadio San Siro against AC Milan.
The following season however, Licata were relegated to Serie C1 after finishing in 18th position. A couple of seasons later, in 1991–92 they were relegated down to Serie C2. They were then relegated in the 1992–94 season, and were set to compete in the CND league, but slow decay for the Sicilian club was complete and they became bankrupt in 1994.
Refoundations.
A new club, Licata AC, was then founded and admitted to the regional Eccellenza league. But in 1996, after having daringly avoided relegation, Licata AC did not register to Eccellenza and was cancelled too; a new team, Santos Licata (then Nuovo Licata, that finally switched to the current denomination), started from Promozione (7th level in the Italian football league system).
During the 2005–06 season, Licata won the round A of Sicilian Eccellenza, consequently returning to Serie D for the first time for a decade.
In the season 2010–11 it was promoted from Eccellenza Sicily group A to Serie D.
A new club was created in 2014 after another bankruptcy.
Colors and badge.
The traditional club colours of Licata is yellow and blue; known in Italy as "gialloblu". The club has two other nicknames; I Santi which means The Saints, and I Falchi which translates as The Hawks.

MAD Dragon Music Group

The Music Industry Program Entities, or the MAD Dragon Music Group (MDMG), is an umbrella company owned by Drexel University, run by university students and overseen by faculty and staff. The purpose of the company is to provide industry experience to the students in the university's Music Industry program. The companies of MDMG include MAD Dragon Records, DraKo Booking, MAD Dragon Publishing, MADKo Concerts, and artist services company Bantic Media.
History of the Music Industry program.
The brainchild of Jonathan Estrin, the dean of the college at that time, the Music Industry program came about in 2000 when he came to Drexel to head the College of Media Arts and Design and wanted to revive the sub-par music program, "re-envisioning the media-oriented university for the new century". Part of the process was redesigning the curriculum, which showed that the music program would need an overhaul and the addition of a recording studio. After obtaining $250,000 in funding staffing was hired for the program. Marcy Rauer Wagman, an entertainment lawyer and former songwriter/producer, was hired to teach about industry law, business models, royalties, and create and manage a student-run record label. The concept of having an umbrella organization was the brainchild of Wagman in 2003 as a way for students to have experience in all aspects of the music industry.
The name MAD Dragon came from the fact that the College of Media Arts and Design was often abbreviated as CoMAD and the university's mascot is a dragon.
MAD Dragon Records.
The record label, MAD Dragon Records, is the only student run record label with a national distribution deal. It was signed through RYKO Distribution in Spring 2005 and is run out of the University itself. The venture between Ryko and MAD Dragon allows the LPs that are produced to be distributed nationally while allowing the students to continue to work with the artist. MAD Dragon Records is currently distributed by the Alternative Distribution Alliance (ADA/Warner).
On December 18, 2007, MAD Dragon Records' work with Hoots &amp; Hellmouth won them the 2008 College Record Label Award from the Independent Music Awards (IMA). They won again in 2009 for their work with The Redwalls. They received over 15 IMA nominations in 2009 and 2010.
MAD Dragon worked with or put out records for artists such as Jules Shear, The Swimmers, Matt Duke, Andrew Lipke, Hoots and Hellmouth, Toy Soldiers, Kuf Knotz, The Spinning Leaves, Pretty Good Dance Moves, and The Redwalls.

Sarratt is both a village and a civil parish in Three Rivers District, Hertfordshire, England. It is situated north of Rickmansworth on high ground near the county boundary with Buckinghamshire. The chalk stream, the River Chess, rising just north of Chesham in the Chiltern Hills, passes through Sarratt Bottom in the valley to the west of the village to join the River Colne in Rickmansworth. The conditions offered by the river are perfect for the cultivation of watercress. Sarratt has the only commercially operating watercress farm in Hertfordshire. The valley to the east of Sarratt is dry.
Church and chapel.
The parish church of Sarratt is the "Church of the Holy Cross". Founded , construction is flint-and-brick built with, reputedly, reused Roman tiles.
From the 17th century a large linear village developed nearly away. Nowadays, this area is referred to as Sarratt Green and the area around the church is known as Church End.
The village also included a Baptist Chapel and an independent Providence Mission Hall; both closed and converted into private residences.
Motorway.
When the M25 London orbital motorwaywidened in 2011 to eight lanes (four each way). Where it passes Sarratt, it is less than distant at its nearest point, the bridge carrying Sarratt Road.
Junction 18 (M25) is on the Chorleywood Road (the A404) only by road from the village.
Schools.
Sarratt's Church of England school, situated near the junction of Church Lane and The Green, is the village's primary school with 160170 pupils. In December 2015 Ofsted inspected the school and judged it to be "good" across the board, having been rated "inadequate" since December 2014.
Sarratt Ducklings, an independent pre-school for children aged from 2 to 4, located in the grounds of Sarratt Primary School, is a registered charity. It was judged outstanding by Ofsted in 2015.
Fiction and filming.
In some of the early novels of John le Carré, Sarratt is the location of a fictional agent-training school and interrogation centre for the British foreign intelligence service, which is nicknamed 'the Nursery'.
Le Carré and Mikhail Lyubimov, a former KGB colonel, contributed to a book published by Village Books in 1999 as a fund-raiser for village charities titled, "Sarratt and the Draper of Watford".

London–Sydney Marathon

The London–Sydney Marathon was a car rally from the United Kingdom to Australia. It was first run in 1968, a second event by the same organizers was run in 1977 and a third in 1993 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the original. Three further rallies have subsequently been contested in 2000, 2004 and 2014.
The 1968 event inspired different organisers to create the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally, the 1974 London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally and the Dakar Rally.
The original 1968 event was won by Andrew Cowan, Colin Malkin and Brian Coyle, driving a Hillman Hunter. Fifty-six cars finished.
1968.
Background.
The original Marathon was the result of a lunch in late 1967, during a period of despondency in Britain caused by the devaluation of the pound. Sir Max Aitken, proprietor of the "Daily Express" and two of his editorial executives, Jocelyn Stevens and Tommy Sopwith, decided to create an event which their newspaper could sponsor, and which would serve to raise the country's spirits. Such an event would, it was felt, act as a showcase for British engineering and would boost export sales in the countries through which it passed.
The initial UK£10,000 winner's prize offered by the "Daily Express" was soon joined by a £3,000 runners-up award and two £2,000 prizes for the third-placed team and for the highest-placed Australians, all of which were underwritten by the "Daily Telegraph" newspaper and its proprietor Frank Packer, who was eager to promote the Antipodean leg of the rally.
The route.
An eight-man organising committee was established to create a suitably challenging but navigable route. Jack Sears, organising secretary and himself a former racing driver, plotted a course covering eleven countries in as many days, and arranged that the P&amp;O liner SS "Chusan" would ferry the first 72 cars and their crews on the nine-day voyage from India, before the final across Australia:
The remaining crews departed Bombay at 03:00 on 5 December, arriving in Fremantle at 10:00 on 13 December before they restarted in Perth the following evening. Any repairs attempted on the car during the voyage would lead to the crew's exclusion.
Result.
Roger Clark established an early lead through the first genuinely treacherous leg, from Sivas to Erzincan in Turkey, averaging almost in his Lotus Cortina for the stage. Despite losing time in Pakistan and India, he maintained his lead to the end of the Asian section in Bombay, with Simo Lampinen's Ford Taunus second and Lucien Bianchi's Citroën DS in third.
However, once into Australia, Clark suffered several setbacks. A piston failure dropped him to third, and would have cost him a finish had he not been able to cannibalise fellow Ford driver Eric Jackson's car for parts. After repairs were effected, he suffered what should have been a terminal rear differential failure. Encountering a Cortina by the roadside, he persuaded the initially reluctant owner to sell his rear axle and resumed once more, although at the cost of 80 minutes' delay while it was replaced.
This left Lucien Bianchi and co-driver Jean-Claude Ogier in the Citroën DS in the lead ahead of Gilbert Staepelaere/Simo Lampinen in the German Ford Taunus, with Andrew Cowan in the Hillman Hunter 3rd. Then Staepelaere's Taunus hit a gate post, breaking a track rod. This left Cowan in second position and Paddy Hopkirk's Austin 1800 in third place. Approaching the Nowra checkpoint at the end of the penultimate stage with only to Sydney, the Frenchmen were involved in a head-on collision with a motorist who mistakenly entered a closed course, wrecking their Citroën DS and hospitalising the pair.
Hopkirk, the first driver on the scene (ahead of Cowan on the road, but behind on penalties) stopped to tend to the injured and extinguish the flames in the burning cars. Andrew Cowan, next on the scene, also slowed but was waved through with the message that everything was under control. Hopkirk rejoined the rally, and neither he nor Cowan lost penalties in this stage. So Andrew Cowan, who had requested "a car to come last" from the Chrysler factory on the assumption that only half a dozen drivers would even reach Sydney, took victory in his Hillman Hunter and claimed the £10,000 prize. Hopkirk finished second, while Australian Ian Vaughan was third in a factory-entered Ford XT Falcon GT. Ford Australia won the Teams' Prize with their three Falcons GTs, placing 3rd, 6th and 8th.
1977.
The success of the 1968 marathon spawned the World Cup rallies, although after the controversial 1974 event, no further World Cup event would be held. While the original event was to prove a triumph for the Rootes Group, the 1977 edition, this time sponsored by Singapore Airlines, was dominated by Mercedes-Benz. The German marque claimed a 1–2 finish and had two other cars in the top eight, with Andrew Cowan in a 280E repeating his success of nine years previous, followed home by teammate Tony Fowkes in a similar car. Paddy Hopkirk, this time driving a Citroën CX, took the final podium spot.
1993.
Nick Brittan, a competitor in the original event in a Lotus Cortina, established his company as an organiser of modern endurance rallies with a 25th anniversary re-run of the marathon in 1993. He persuaded 21 drivers who had competed in 1968 to return, including Andrew Cowan and Roger Clark, and altogether 106 teams from 17 countries entered. Cowan drove the same car as the first time, having his Hillman Hunter loaned to him by the Scottish Automobile Club museum, while other competitors drove pre-1970 era cars. The entry fee was £12,900, and the estimated cost of participating was put at £45,000.
The 16,000 km rally had three major differences to its ancestor. First, the changing political climate in the Middle East meant that several countries such as Iran and Afghanistan were now out of bounds, although in Europe, Turkey and Australia much of the original route was retraced. Also, the old scheduled open road sections were replaced with more modern timed special stages for safety reasons. Finally, with the demise of the great passenger liners there would be no great voyage across the Indian Ocean to Australia, Brittan instead negotiating for two Antonov An-124 cargo planes to take the vehicles to Australia.
The winning driver was Francis Tuthill in a Porsche 911, ahead of the Ford Falcon GT of Ian Vaughan who finished third in 1968. Kenya's Mike Kirkland, a stalwart of the Safari Rally, took the final place on the podium in a Peugeot 504.
2000.
A second rerun was organised in 2000 as a "Millennium celebration of [the] first epic event." Again, much of Asia was inaccessible for political reasons, with two airlifts instead of the single one of 1993. Now, after crossing Europe and Turkey in the first fourteen days, the competitors would be loaded on to the Antonovs for the trip to northern Thailand, driving south through the country and into Malaysia for twelve days before being flown to Australia for the last eight days of the rally.
Of the 100 starters who left London 78 reached Sydney, with Stig Blomqvist and Ben Rainsford scoring victory ahead of Michèle Mouton in a Porsche 911, whose co-driver was 1993 winner Francis Tuthill. Rick Bates and Jenny Brittan in another 911 took third.
2004.
The third re-run was a combination of modern Group N (showroom-class) cars, and pre-1977 classics, all limited to two wheel drive and a sub-two-litre engine. New Zealand, in tandem with Lincolnshire, England race-preparation specialists Langworth Motorsport, scored a 1–2–3 podium clean sweep with three Kiwi-piloted Honda Integras; overall winners Joe McAndrew and Murray Cole, runners-up Mike Montgomery and Roy Wilson, and Shane Murland and John Benton in third. The highest-placed classic car was a Ford Escort RS1600 driven by Anthony Ward and Mark Solloway, which finished sixth overall.
2014.
Ten years later a sixth Marathon was run. Differing from its five predecessors it was run in the reverse direction, starting in Sydney and travelling to London with an airlift linking the west coast of Australia to Turkey.

Mohan Singh Oberoi

Rai Bahadur Mohan Singh Oberoi (15 August 1898 – 3 May 2002) was an Indian businessman and politician. Oberoi was the founder and chairman of Oberoi Hotels &amp; Resorts, India's second-largest hotel company, with 31 hotels in India, Egypt, Indonesia, UAE, Mauritius and Saudi Arabia. Oberoi was also active in politics and was a member of both houses of the Parliament of India during his political career.
In his obituary, the "Times of India" said that he was acknowledged for putting the Indian hotel industry on the global map by successfully establishing hotel brands like Oberoi and Trident worldwide.
Early life.
Oberoi was born in a Punjabi Khatri Sikh family in Bhaun, a minor village of Jhelum District (now Chakwal District), Punjab, British India. When he was six months old, his father, a contractor in Peshawar, died, leaving his mother with few resources.
After attending schools in his village and nearby Rawalpindi, he passed the Intermediate College Examination in Lahore, but was unable to continue attending classes because of lack of finances. During his time studying in Lahore Law College, Oberoi lived with his uncle, a devout Sikh, who asked him to leave when Oberoi shaved hair on his chin. He later moved to Shimla.
Career.
Early career and struggle.
In 1922, Oberoi got a job at The Cecil Hotel in Shimla. to escape from the epidemic of plague and as front desk clerk, at a salary of Rs.50 per month. He was a quick learner and took many additional responsibilities. The manager of The Cecil, Ernest Clarke and his wife Gertrude took a great liking to the honesty of a hardworking young Oberoi.
Clarke and his wife decided to hand over the responsibility of managing Hotel Carlton now renamed as Clarkes to Oberoi. It was here, at Clarkes Hotel, that he gained firsthand experience in all aspects of operating a hotel. During their six months absence, Oberoi doubled up the occupancy to eighty percent which gave them enough reason to offer the hotel on a decided amount to Oberoi as they wanted to return to England.
Business career.
Early in his business career, Oberoi nearly faced financial ruin as he used his then-current properties as collateral to acquire The Grand Hotel's lease, in Kolkata, and later discovered the hotel had contaminated water issues. Later, Oberoi over time acquired shares of Associated Hotels of India (AHI), a group that owned variously hotels including the Cecil and Corstophans in Shimla, Maidens and The Imperial in Delhi, and other properties in Lahore, Murree, Rawalpindi, and Peshawar. In 1943, he managed to gain a controlling stake in AHI. However, Oberoi later lost control of The Imperial in a lease battle.
He managed to fund his acquisition of AHI and avoid financial ruin from his earlier The Grand Hotel acquisition through strategically offering the British quartermaster general, during World War II, affordable rates to accommodate troops passing through Calcutta on their way to the Burma front. The influx of troops brought substantial revenue. He would charge the British soldiers a double rate for the women they sneaked in.
After India became independent in 1947, Oberoi built additional hotels, while expanding his base holdings. In 1948, he established East India Hotels, now known as EIH. In April 1955, he was elected President of the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India, and in 1960 was named President of Honour of the Federation for life. In 1965, in partnership with international hotel chains, he opened the Oberoi Intercontinental in Delhi. In 1973, Oberoi founded the Oberoi Sheraton in Mumbai.
Political career.
He participated in legislative politics by winning elections to the Rajya Sabha for two terms, from April 1962 to March 1968 and from April 1972 to April 1978. He was elected to the fourth Lok Sabha in April 1968 as a candidate of the Jharkhand Party from the Hazaribagh Lok Sabha constituency, and remained a Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha till December 1972.
Oberoi Group.
The Oberoi Group, founded in 1934, employed about 12,000 people worldwide and owned and managed about thirty hotels and five luxury cruisers . Oberoi Amarvilas, Agra, ranks amongst the top ten hotel spas Asia-Pacific, Africa, and the Middle East of the "Travel + Leisure" magazine, and ranked third in Best Hotels in Asia in 2007. Other activities include airline catering, management of restaurants and airport bars, travel and tour services, car rental, project management and corporate air charters. The Group has a number of hotels worldwide, latest hotel additions being in Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Egypt and Africa.
Oberoi was the first to employ women in the hospitality sector. In 1966, he also established The Oberoi Centre for Learning and Development, which is now regarded as one of Asia's top institutions for hospitality education.
Honours and awards.
Throughout his later life Oberoi received numerous honours and awards from the Indian government and other organizations. Oberoi was presented with the title Rai Bahadur (pater familiae) by the British Raj government in 1943. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, one of India's highest civilian awards, in 2001.
Centenarian.
Almost all publications indicated Oberoi's year of birth as 1898 and his age at death as 103. In his own autobiographical sketch – "How M S Oberoi became India's greatest hotelier", however, he gave 1900 as his official birth year, a fact attesting to his having lived to 101. However, "The New York Times" obituary, the date is given as 1898 and the following was written: "He was 103, although for years he said he was born in 1900 because he did not want to be seen as dating from the 19th century."
Personal life and family.
Oberoi married Ishran Devi in 1920, the daughter of Shri Ushnak Rai belonging to his village. They had two sons, Tilak Raj and Prithvi Raj Singh, and 3 daughters, Swaraj, Rajrani and Prem. Oberoi died on 3 May 2002, at the age of 103. Tilak Raj died in 1984 and Prithvi Raj Singh succeeded Oberoi as the Chairman of EHI in 2002 after Oberoi died.
Oberoi's nephew Brij Raj Oberoi, nicknamed "Diamond Oberoi" by Oberoi, also ventured into the hospitality industry, operating several Heritage hotels in the Himalayas.

Saba Mahmood

Saba Mahmood (1961–2018) was professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, she was also affiliated with the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Institute for South Asia Studies, and the Program in Critical Theory. Her scholarly work straddled debates in anthropology and political theory, with a focus on Muslim majority societies of West Asia (including the Middle East) and South Asia. Mahmood made major theoretical contributions to rethinking the relationship between ethics and politics, religion and secularism, freedom and submission, and reason and embodiment. Influenced by the work of Talal Asad, she wrote on issues of gender, religious politics, secularism, and Muslim and non-Muslim relations in the Middle East.
Career.
Mahmood was born on February 3, 1961, in Quetta, Pakistan, where her father was a policeman. In 1981, she moved to Seattle to study at the University of Washington. She received her PhD in anthropology from Stanford University in 1998. She also held master's degrees in Political Science, Architecture, and Urban Planning. She married Charles Hirschkind, an anthropology professor at UC Berkeley, in 2003. Prior to joining Berkeley in 2004, she taught at the University of Chicago.
Prior to studying anthropology, Mahmood spent four years studying architecture, during which she was also involved in movements against US foreign policy in Central America and the Middle East. After the first Gulf War, she showed interest in Islamic politics and the challenge it brought against secular nationalism in the Muslim societies, which eventually led her to anthropology. 
Mahmood held visiting appointments at the American Academy in Berlin, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and Leiden University. She taught at the School of Criticism and Theory at Cornell University, the Venice School of Human Rights, and the Institute of Global Law and Policy. She was a co-convener of the Summer Seminar in Experimental Critical Theory at the University of California Humanities Research Institute, Irvine. Mahmood served on the editorial boards of "Representations," "Anthropology Today", "L'Homme", "Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East," and "Journal of the American Academy of Religion".
Mahmood was the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships, including an honorary doctorate from Uppsala University, the Carnegie Corporation's scholar of Islam award, the Frederick Burkhardt fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies, and grants from the Henry Luce Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies, and Harvard Academy of International and Area Studies. Her book "Politics of Piety: The Islamic Revival and the Feminist Subject" received the 2005 Victoria Schuck Award from the American Political Science Association and was an honorable mention for the 2005 Albert Hourani Book Award from the Middle East Studies Association. Her book "Religious Difference in a Secular Age: A Minority Report" received the 2016 Clifford Geertz Prize in the Anthropology of Religion from the Society for the Anthropology of Religion. Her work has been translated into Arabic, French, Persian, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish, and Polish.
Overview of work.
Mahmood's work has carried profound implications for the philosophical and empirical study of sovereignty, subjectivity and feminist agency, and has led many scholars to reconsider dominant approaches to the law and the modern state, particularly with respect to how religious subjects and groups are governed and defined. Crossing disciplinary boundaries in the humanities and social sciences, her work has shaped theoretical and ethnographic inquiry into religion and freedom in modernity, as well as the legacies of colonialism, capitalism, and secularism in contemporary conflicts in the Middle East.
"Politics of Piety" (2005).
In "Politics of Piety: the Islamic Revival and the Feminist Subject", Saba Mahmood offers an ethnography of the women's piety movement in Cairo, Egypt, which is part of a larger Egyptian movement of Islamic political revival and reform. Drawing on this ethnography, the book interrogates the liberal and secular epistemologies that inform dominant understandings of modern Islamic politics, freedom, and agency. The book's key theoretical interventions include examining Aristotelian discourses on ethics as they are taken up in both the Islamic tradition and continental thought; critically engaging anthropological theory on cultural and embodied practice, including the work of Marcel Mauss, Pierre Bourdieu and Michel Foucault; and intervening in feminist theory on agency, gender and embodiment, and particularly through the work of Judith Butler. In these ways, Mahmood interrogates the relationship between bodily practices and bodily form, on the one hand, and ethical and political imaginaries, on the other, while at the same time questioning the presumed separation of the domains of ethics and politics.
The second edition of "Politics of Piety" was published in 2011. In the Preface, Mahmood addressed the book's critics who had argued her engagement with the women's piety movement was "an abandonment of feminism’s emancipatory mandate". She wrote that her critics "ignore the fact that I was not interested in delivering judgments on what counts as a feminist versus an anti-feminist practice". She argued that an analysis that leads with a moral evaluation of the women's movement does not yield a better understanding of it. “My task as a scholar," she wrote, "is not simply to denounce, but to try to understand what motivates people to be involved in such movements.”
"Religious Freedom, Minority Rights, and Geopolitics" (2012).
In "Religious Freedom, Minority Rights, and Geopolitics", Mahmood challenges the meaning of religious freedom as a universal concept by examining its development in the Middle East, in particular, the Ottoman Empire. She pointed out that geopolitical tension, instead of a consensus across different cultures, shaped the course of religious freedom. 
The Ottoman Empire, which is the primary subject of study in this article, implemented a hierarchical system to rule its population of diverse religious affiliations. The system positioned Muslim at the most privileged position, and granted restricted autonomy to non-Muslims such as Christians and Jews. In 1856, the Empire granted freedom of religion to its citizens through the Imperial Reform Edict. This progression to religious freedom, however, is due to a shift in power dynamics between European Christian states and the Ottoman Empire, after centuries of rivalry. Mahmood then pointed out that religious freedom is not an idea that merely promotes inclusion, rather it is coupled with the struggles between regional powers. She further questioned whether the advocacy of religious freedom, as well as other forms of human right, can be isolated from seeking geopolitical advantages.
"Religious Difference in a Secular Age" (2015).
In "Religious Difference in a Secular Age: A Minority Report", Mahmood challenges liberal conceptions of secularism as religion's opposite as well as celebratory views of secularism as the solution to religious discrimination. Drawing on the intertwined history of secularism in the Middle East and Europe, and extensive fieldwork on the experiences of Copts and Bahais in Egypt, Mahmood explores the conceptual, discursive and lived paradoxes of political secularism. In essence, how can the existing religious inequality in a society be remediated by state law that disregards difference in religion? Mahmood believed that this paradox caused the debate over deliberate protection for religious minorities in the 1923 Egyptian constitution and again in 2012 after the Egyptian Revolution. Mahmood concludes that "political secularism is the modern state's sovereign power to reorganize substantive features of religious life, stipulating what religion is or ought to be, assigning its proper content, and disseminating concomitant subjectivities, ethical frameworks, and quotidian practices".
"Politics of Religious Freedom" (2015).
Co-authored with Elizabeth Hurd, Peter Danchin, and Winnifred Sullivan, "Politics of Religious Freedom" was written after a three-year project funded by the Henry Luce Foundation, unfolding the development of religious freedom in Europe, the US, the Middle East, and South Asia. Collecting from more than twenty contributors, the book shows that religious persecution has a more diverse and complicated background than one would typically assume. The book also carried the idea from previous work of Mahmood on how advancing religious liberty without discretion can create an adverse effect.
Death.
Mahmood died from pancreatic cancer on March 10, 2018, in Berkeley, California. On her behalf, the Department of Anthropology of the University of California said: "Saba Mahmood was a brilliant scholar, cherished colleague, and dedicated teacher and graduate mentor. Along with her ceaseless political passions and trenchant analyses, she keened to the beauty of the wilderness, the poetry of Ghalib, the delights of cooking and sharing excellent food. She cultivated with joyous attention her relationships with family and friends. She mentored her students with remarkable care and intensity, demanding their best work, listening, responding with a sharp generosity, coming alive in thought, and soliciting others to do the same. In her final months, she affirmed the values of thought and love, leaving now a vibrant legacy that will persist and flourish among all whose lives were touched by her life and work. She is survived by her husband, Charles Hirschkind, her son, Nameer Hirschkind."

Callen-Lorde Community Health Center

Callen-Lorde Community Health Center is a primary care center located at 356 West 18th Street in New York, New York, with satellite locations in Brooklyn and The Bronx. Callen-Lorde also provides comprehensive mental health services at Brooklyn Community Health Center. Callen-Lorde is dedicated to providing medical health care to the city's LGBTQ population without regard to ability to pay. It is named in honor of Michael Callen and Audre Lorde.
Their facilities offer a variety of services, including dental care, HIV/STD testing and treatment, mental health services, women's health services, transgender hormone therapy, and medical case management support. Callen-Lorde is also home to the Health Outreach to Teens (HOTT) program, which serves youth between the ages of 13 and 24 in an on-premises clinic and a fully equipped medical van. The Cecilia Occupational Inclusion Network (COIN) Clinic, founded by late transgender icon Cecilia Gentili, is also housed within Callen-Lorde.
Callen-Lorde is the only primary care center in New York City created specifically to serve LGBTQ communities. Callen-Lorde's grassroots heritage dates back nearly 50 years to the St. Mark's Community Clinic and the Gay Men's Health Project, two volunteer-based clinics that provided screening and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. These clinics merged in 1983 to form Community Health Project, a mostly volunteer-staffed, episodic care program housing the nation's first community-based HIV clinic. The center has grown both in size and scope since these early days: from a 2,500 square-foot space inside of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center on West 13th Street that primarily worked with HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, into a comprehensive primary care center housed in more than 3 locations, including the 6-floor, 27,000 square-foot 18th Street facility that it moved into in 1997.
In 2007, it was among over 530 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $30 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.
In 2015, during National Health Center Week, Callen-Lorde was one of 266 health centers selected for Affordable Care Act funding as a Federally Qualified Health Center, for providing primary care to a medically underserved population. In a proclamation announcing these awards, President Obama declared, "This week, as we recognize the 50-year anniversary of the first community health centers being established in America, let us remember that health care is not a privilege for the few among us who can afford it, but a right for all Americans -- and let us recognize the vital role health centers across our country play in carrying us toward greater health for our people."
In 2016, Callen-Lorde opened a new center in The Bronx, located at 3144 3rd Avenue, located in the South Bronx neighborhood. Their Brooklyn location would open in 2020 after an $18.2 million dollar and 25,000-square-foot facility was constructed in Downtown Brooklyn, located at 40 Flatbush Avenue Extension.

Joseph A. "Socks" Lanza (1904 – October 11, 1968) was a New York labor racketeer and a member of the Genovese crime family, who controlled the Fulton Fish Market in Lower Manhattan through the United Seafood Worker's Union local 359 from 1923 to 1968.
Biography.
Born in Palermo, Sicily, Lanza immigrated to the United States and settled in New York working as a handler in Lower Manhattan's Fulton Fish Market. Lanza soon became involved in labor union activity and, by 1923, had become an organizer for the United Seafood Workers union (USW). It was during this time that Lanza had become involved in organized crime, eventually becoming a member of the Luciano (and later the Genovese) crime family. As head of the Local 359 USW, Lanza threatened wholesalers with delays in loading and unloading perishable goods resulting in profits of $20 million from the Fulton Fish Market alone.
Although convicted of labor racketeering in 1938, Lanza became an important figure in safeguarding New York's waterfront during the early 1940s. Lanza personally advised the Office of Naval Intelligence working with local stevedores and fisherman in tracking submarines, resulting in obtaining key strategic positions in waterfront installations and effectively conduct counter-espionage activities for the Third Naval District.
Although Lanza had helped secure the New York waterfront, he was convicted of extortion the following year and sentenced from 7½ to 10 years imprisonment. Upon his release in 1950, Lanza resumed his leadership role in the Fulton Fish Market and, despite a 1957 arrest for parole violation; he maintained control of the area until his death on October 11, 1968.

Snowblind Studios was an American video game developer located in Kirkland, Washington. They were founded in 1997, specializing in role-playing video games.
In February 2009, Snowblind Studios was acquired by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. Originally located in Bothell, Washington, after the Warner Bros. acquisition, the studio was relocated to Kirkland. Following the release of ", the studio was merged in with Monolith Productions in 2012.
Game engine.
The Snowblind engine, also referred to as the Dark Alliance game engine, is a game engine created by Snowblind Studios for perspective correct overhead third person view role-playing games. It was first used by Snowblind Studios to create ". The previous "Baldur's Gate" games used the Infinity Engine which was created by BioWare for isometric role-playing games.
The first game to use the engine was "Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance", a joint collaboration between Interplay Entertainment and Snowblind Studios. Interplay then used the engine for all their ports of the game except the Game Boy Advance version, which used its own game engine. These ports of the game greatly expanded on how much content the game was able to use and the amount of save slots present in the game.
The engine was then used by Snowblind Studios in its "EverQuest" games starting with "Champions of Norrath". Snowblind improved the engine in their own ways, such as adding new features such as character creation and online multiplayer. Interplay, however, continued to use the engine, due to the fact they partly owned the engine, for their console games. Interplay used the engine for their sequel to "Dark Alliance", ', which was developed by Black Isle Studios. This sequel once again improved on the engine's capabilities and added more features, improved graphics and better audio; it added features from the Infinity Engine "Baldur's Gate" games such as "Companions". Interplay then released ' and "The Bard's Tale"; both games improved on the engine in their own way. "Brotherhood of Steel" added a reputation system to the game and "The Bard's Tale" improved on other features of the engine, such as audio. "The Bard's Tale" was the Dark Alliance Engine's first PC release. Interplay was developing a sequel to "Brotherhood of Steel", "". This game would have added the features of sniping, stealth and a more advanced reputation system, but was soon canceled.
Snowblind Studios then released ', which refined the online multiplayer and changed the linear portion of the games released for the engine and allowed characters to change the ending. Around this time, Snowblind began to license the engine out to indie developers, but only one could make a game. The game was met with a lawsuit by Titus Software, the owners of Interplay, and Acclaim Entertainment but in the end, it was ultimately released as '.
Snowblind then created "Justice League Heroes" with the same engine in 2006. The game was released around the time the next gen of video game consoles was out, but due to it being created for the previous gen, it was released for Xbox and PlayStation 2. A portable version of the engine was used for the PlayStation Portable. The Game Boy Advance version, which was released as "", used its own engine, and the Nintendo DS version did the same thing. To fit the superhero theme of the game, Snowblind Studios put most of their effort into the length of the game, thereby taking out many features of the engine.

Louis de Watteville

Louis de Watteville (born Abraham Ludwig Karl von Wattenwyl; 1 July 1776 – 16 June 1836) was a Swiss mercenary in Dutch and British service. He became a major general in the British Army, and fought in the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812.
Early life and career.
Watteville was born in Grandson, Switzerland to David Salomon von Wattenwyl and Elisabeth Magdalena Jenner, and first served as a mercenary in the Netherlands. In 1801 he took over the command of De Watteville's Regiment from his uncle, Franz Friedrich von Wattenwyl. The regiment entered British service, and de Watteville fought with it in the French campaign in Egypt and Syria.
Napoleonic Wars.
Louis fought with the regiment at the Battle of Maida, in 1806, and at the Siege of Cádiz. He was appointed Colonel of his regiment in 1812. In the following year, he and the regiment were transferred from Cádiz to Upper Canada. By this time the regiment was a mixture of nationalities, including German, Italian and Hungarian, many of whom had been taken prisoner of war by the British while serving in the French armies in Spain.
War of 1812.
On arrival at Québec, de Watteville immediately struck up a friendship with the Governor General of Canada, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, himself of Swiss origin. He received promotion to Major General on 11 August 1813, although for a time held no appointment. On 17 October, he was appointed to command the district of Montreal, which at the time was threatened by American armies approaching on two fronts. De Watteville immediately called out the militia and began strengthening his defences, but on 26 October, his collected outpost units under Lieutenant Colonel Charles de Salaberry defeated the nearest American force at the Battle of Chateauguay. De Watteville was present and gave full credit to de Salaberry in his dispatch. Prevost, however, who was also present, belittled both de Watteville and de Salaberry in his own dispatch, which took precedence over those of his subordinates.
In June 1814, de Watteville was transferred briefly to the Richelieu River sector, but on 8 August, he was appointed to command the "Right Division" on the Niagara River in Upper Canada, succeeding Major General Phineas Riall, who had been wounded and taken prisoner by the Americans at the Battle of Lundy's Lane. He reported to the siege lines around Fort Erie on 15 August. On 17 September, American troops made a sortie against de Watteville's lines, leading to a bloody engagement in which about 600 men were killed or wounded on each side.
As campaigning wound down over the winter, de Watteville took leave in Montreal to meet his wife and family. Here he learned that the War had ended. After presiding over the court martial of Major General Henry Procter, he resumed his command.
In late 1815, de Watteville was appointed commander in chief of the forces in Upper Canada. He preferred to retire from the army and returned to Switzerland. He bought an estate in Rubigen, and was a member of the Grand Council of Bern from 1817 to 1831. He died in Rubigen on 16 June 1836.
De Watteville's Regiment.
Note: de Watteville's regiment, although no longer under his command from the date of his promotion to Major General, suffered heavy casualties at Fort Erie, and also suffered heavily from desertion. As already mentioned, by the time it arrived in Canada it was a motley mix of nationalities with little obvious cause for loyalty to the British cause. On the end of the war, several of its survivors accepted discharge on the spot, and settled in Upper Canada. The members of the regiment were offered land grants.

Concept learning

Concept learning, also known as category learning, concept attainment, and concept formation, is defined by Bruner, Goodnow, &amp; Austin (1956) as "the search for and testing of attributes that can be used to distinguish exemplars from non exemplars of various categories". More simply put, concepts are the mental categories that help us classify objects, events, or ideas, building on the understanding that each object, event, or idea has a set of common relevant features. Thus, concept learning is a strategy which requires a learner to compare and contrast groups or categories that contain concept-relevant features with groups or categories that do not contain concept-relevant features.
The concept of concept attainment requires the following five categories:
In a concept learning task, a human classifies objects by being shown a set of example objects along with their class labels. The learner simplifies what has been observed by condensing it in the form of an example. This simplified version of what has been learned is then applied to future examples. Concept learning may be simple or complex because learning takes place over many areas. When a concept is difficult, it is less likely that the learner will be able to simplify, and therefore will be less likely to learn. Colloquially, the task is known as "learning from examples." Most theories of concept learning are based on the storage of exemplars and avoid summarization or overt abstraction of any kind.
In machine learning, this theory can be applied in training computer programs. 
Types of concepts.
Concept learning must be distinguished from learning by reciting something from memory (recall) or discriminating between two things that differ (discrimination). However, these issues are closely related, since memory recall of facts could be considered a "trivial" conceptual process where prior exemplars representing the concept are invariant. Similarly, while discrimination is not the same as initial concept learning, discrimination processes are involved in refining concepts by means of the repeated presentation of exemplars. Concept attainment is rooted in inductive learning. So, when designing a curriculum or learning through this method, comparing like and unlike examples are key in defining the characteristics of a topic.
Concrete or perceptual concepts vs abstract concepts.
Concrete concepts are objects that can be perceived by personal sensations and perceptions. These are objects like chairs and dogs where personal interactions occur with them and create a concept. Concepts become more concrete as the word we use to associate with it has a perceivable entity. According to Paivio’s dual-coding theory, concrete concepts are the one that is remembered easier from their perceptual memory codes. Evidence has shown that when words are heard they are associated with a concrete concept and are re-enact any previous interaction with the word within the sensorimotor system. Examples of concrete concepts in learning are early educational math concepts like adding and subtracting.
Abstract concepts are words and ideas that deal with emotions, personality traits and events. Terms like "fantasy" or "cold" have a more abstract concept within them. Every person has their personal definition, which is ever-changing and comparing, of abstract concepts. For example, cold could mean the physical temperature of the surrounding area, or it could define the action and personality of another person. However, within concrete concepts there is still a level of abstractness; concrete and abstract concepts can be seen on a scale. Some ideas like chair and dog are more cut and dry in their perceptions but concepts like cold and fantasy can be seen in a more obscure way. Examples of abstract concept learning are topics like religion and ethics. Abstract-concept learning is seeing the comparison of the stimuli based on a rule (e.g., identity, difference, oddity, greater than, addition, subtraction) and when it is a novel stimulus. Abstract-concept learning has three criteria to rule out any alternative explanations to define the novelty of the stimuli. One transfer stimuli has to be novel to the individual. This means it needs to be a new stimulus to the individual. Two, there is no replication of the transfer stimuli. Third and lastly, to have a full abstract learning experience, there has to be an equal amount of baseline performance and transfer performance.
Binder, Westbury, McKiernan, Possing, and Medler (2005) used fMRI to scan individuals' brains as they made lexical decisions on abstract and concrete concepts. Abstract concepts elicited greater activation in the left precentral gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus and sulcus, and left superior temporal gyrus, whereas concrete concepts elicited greater activation in bilateral angular gyri, the right middle temporal gyrus, the left middle frontal gyrus, bilateral posterior cingulate gyri, and bilateral precunei.
In 1986 Allan Paivio hypothesized the dual-coding theory, which states that both verbal and visual information is used to represent information. When thinking of the concept "dog", thoughts of both the word dog and an image of a dog occur. Dual-coding theory assumes that abstract concepts involve the verbal semantic system and concrete concepts are additionally involved with the visual imaginary system.
Defined (or relational) and associated concepts.
Relational and associated concepts are words, ideas and thoughts that are connected in some form. For relational concepts they are connected in a universal definition. Common relational terms are up-down, left-right, and food-dinner. These ideas are learned in our early childhood and are important for children to understand. These concepts are integral within our understanding and reasoning in conservation tasks. Relational terms that are verbs and prepositions have a large influence on how objects are understood. These terms are more likely to create a larger understanding of the object and they are able to cross over to other languages.
Associated concepts are connected by the individual’s past and own perception. Associative concept learning (also called functional concept learning) involves categorizing stimuli based on a common response or outcome regardless of perceptual similarity into appropriate categories. This is associating these thoughts and ideas with other thoughts and ideas that are understood by a few or the individual. An example of this is in elementary school when learning the direction of the compass North, East, South and West. Teacher have used “Never Eat Soggy Waffles”, “Never Eat Sour Worms” and students were able to create their own version to help them learn the directions.
Complex concepts.
Constructs such as a schema and a script are examples of complex concepts. A schema is an organization of smaller concepts (or features) and is revised by situational information to assist in comprehension. A script on the other hand is a list of actions that a person follows in order to complete a desired goal. An example of a script would be the process of buying a CD. There are several actions that must occur before the actual act of purchasing the CD and a script provides a sequence of the necessary actions and proper order of these actions in order to be successful in purchasing the CD.
Concept attainment learning plan development.
Concept attainment for in education and learning is an active learning method. Therefore, learning plans, methods, and goals can be chosen to implement concept attainment.
David Perkin's Work on Knowledge as Design, Perkin's 4 Questions outline learning plan questions:
1) What are the critical attributes of the concept?
2) What are the purposes of the concept?
3) What model cases of the concept?
4) What are the arguments for learning the concept?
Bias in concept attainment.
Concept learning has been historically studied with deep influences from goals and functions that concepts are assumed to have. Research has investigated how function of concepts influences the learning process, which focuses on the external function. Focusing on different models for concept attainment research would expand studies in this field. When reading articles and studies, noticing potential bias and qualifying the resource is required in this topic.
Inductive learning and ML conflict with concept learning.
In general, the theoretical issues underlying concept learning for machine learning are those underlying induction. These issues are addressed in many diverse publications, including literature on subjects like Version Spaces, Statistical Learning Theory, PAC Learning, Information Theory, and Algorithmic Information Theory. Some of the broad theoretical ideas are also discussed by Watanabe (1969, 1985), Solomonoff (1964a, 1964b), and Rendell (1986); see the reference list below.
Modern psychological theories.
It is difficult to make any general statements about human (or animal) concept learning without already assuming a particular psychological theory of concept learning. Although the classical views of concepts and concept learning in philosophy speak of a process of abstraction, data compression, simplification, and summarization, currently popular psychological theories of concept learning diverge on all these basic points. The history of psychology has seen the rise and fall of many theories about concept learning. Classical conditioning (as defined by Pavlov) created the earliest experimental technique. Reinforcement learning as described by Watson and elaborated by Clark Hull created a lasting paradigm in behavioral psychology. Cognitive psychology emphasized a computer and information flow metaphor for concept formation. Neural network models of concept formation and the structure of knowledge have opened powerful hierarchical models of knowledge organization such as George Miller's Wordnet. Neural networks are based on computational models of learning using factor analysis or convolution. Neural networks also are open to neuroscience and psychophysiological models of learning following Karl Lashley and Donald Hebb.
Rule-based.
Rule-based theories of concept learning began with cognitive psychology and early computer models of learning that might be implemented in a high level computer language with computational statements such as if:then production rules. They take classification data and a rule-based theory as input which are the result of a rule-based learner with the hopes of producing a more accurate model of the data. The majority of rule-based models that have been developed are heuristic, meaning that rational analyses have not been provided and the models are not related to statistical approaches to induction. A rational analysis for rule-based models could presume that concepts are represented as rules, and would then ask to what degree of belief a rational agent should be in agreement with each rule, with some observed examples provided. Rule-based theories of concept learning are focused more so on perceptual learning and less on definition learning. Rules can be used in learning when the stimuli are confusable, as opposed to simple. When rules are used in learning, decisions are made based on properties alone and rely on simple criteria that do not require a lot of memory.
Example of rule-based theory:
"A radiologist using rule-based categorization would observe whether specific properties of an X-ray image meet certain criteria; for example, is there an extreme difference in brightness in a suspicious region relative to other regions? A decision is then based on this property alone."
Prototype.
The prototype view of concept learning holds that people abstract out the central tendency (or prototype) of the examples experienced and use this as a basis for their categorization decisions.
The prototype view of concept learning holds that people categorize based on one or more central examples of a given category followed by a penumbra of decreasingly typical examples. This implies that people do not categorize based on a list of things that all correspond to a definition, but rather on a hierarchical inventory based on semantic similarity to the central example(s).
Exemplar.
Exemplar theory is the storage of specific instances (exemplars), with new objects evaluated only with respect to how closely they resemble specific known members (and nonmembers) of the category. This theory hypothesizes that learners store examples "verbatim". This theory views concept learning as highly simplistic. Only individual properties are represented. These individual properties are not abstract and they do not create rules. An example of what exemplar theory might look like is "water is wet". It is simply known that some (or one, or all) stored examples of water have the property wet. Exemplar based theories have become more empirically popular over the years with some evidence suggesting that human learners use exemplar based strategies only in early learning, forming prototypes and generalizations later in life. An important result of exemplar models in psychology literature has been a de-emphasis of complexity in concept learning. One of the best known exemplar theories of concept learning is the generalized context model (GCM).
A problem with exemplar theory is that exemplar models critically depend on two measures: similarity between exemplars, and having a rule to determine group membership. Sometimes it is difficult to attain or distinguish these measures.
Multiple-prototype.
More recently, cognitive psychologists have begun to explore the idea that the prototype and exemplar models form two extremes. It has been suggested that people are able to form a multiple prototype representation, besides the two extreme representations. For example, consider the category 'spoon'. There are two distinct subgroups or conceptual clusters: spoons tend to be either large and wooden, or small and made of metal. The prototypical spoon would then be a medium-size object made of a mixture of metal and wood, which is clearly an unrealistic proposal. A more natural representation of the category 'spoon' would instead consist of multiple (at least two) prototypes, one for each cluster. A number of different proposals have been made in this regard (Anderson, 1991; Griffiths, Canini, Sanborn &amp; Navarro, 2007; Love, Medin &amp; Gureckis, 2004; Vanpaemel &amp; Storms, 2008). These models can be regarded as providing a compromise between exemplar and prototype models.
Explanation-based.
The basic idea of explanation-based learning suggests that a new concept is acquired by experiencing examples of it and forming a basic outline. Put simply, by observing or receiving the qualities of a thing the mind forms a concept which possesses and is identified by those qualities.
The original theory, proposed by Mitchell, Keller, and Kedar-Cabelli in 1986 and called explanation-based generalization, is that learning occurs through progressive generalizing. This theory was first developed to program machines to learn. When applied to human cognition, it translates as follows: the mind actively separates information that applies to more than one thing and enters it into a broader description of a category of things. This is done by identifying sufficient conditions for something to fit in a category, similar to schematizing.
The revised model revolves around the integration of four mental processes – generalization, chunking, operationalization, and analogy.
This particular theory of concept learning is relatively new and more research is being conducted to test it.
Bayesian.
Taking a mathematical approach to concept learning, Bayesian theories propose that the human mind produces "probabilities" for a certain concept definition, based on examples it has seen of that concept. The Bayesian concept of Prior Probability stops being overly specific, while the likelihood of a hypothesis ensures the definition is not too broad.
If, say, a child is shown three horses by a parent and told these are called "horses" – she needs to work out exactly what the adult means by this word. She is much more likely to define the word "horses" as referring to either this "type of animal" or "all animals", rather than an oddly specific example like "all horses except Clydesdales", which would be an unnatural concept. Meanwhile, the likelihood of "horses" meaning 'all animals' when the three animals shown are all very similar is low. The hypothesis that the word "horse" refers to all "animals of this species" is most likely of the three possible definitions, as it has both a reasonable prior probability and likelihood given examples.
Bayes' theorem is important because it provides a powerful tool for understanding, manipulating and controlling data5 that takes a larger view that is not limited to data analysis alone6. The approach is subjective, and this requires the assessment of prior probabilities6, making it also very complex. However, if Bayesians show that the accumulated evidence and the application of Bayes' law are sufficient, the work will overcome the subjectivity of the inputs involved7. Bayesian inference can be used for any honestly collected data and has a major advantage because of its scientific focus6.
One model that incorporates the Bayesian theory of concept learning is the ACT-R model, developed by John R. Anderson. The ACT-R model is a programming language that defines the basic cognitive and perceptual operations that enable the human mind by producing a step-by-step simulation of human behavior. This theory exploits the idea that each task humans perform consists of a series of discrete operations. The model has been applied to learning and memory, higher level cognition, natural language, perception and attention, human-computer interaction, education, and computer generated forces.
In addition to John R. Anderson, Joshua Tenenbaum has been a contributor to the field of concept learning; he studied the computational basis of human learning and inference using behavioral testing of adults, children, and machines from Bayesian statistics and probability theory, but also from geometry, graph theory, and linear algebra. Tenenbaum is working to achieve a better understanding of human learning in computational terms and trying to build computational systems that come closer to the capacities of human learners.
Component display theory.
M. D. Merrill's component display theory (CDT) is a cognitive matrix that focuses on the interaction between two dimensions: the level of performance expected from the learner and the types of content of the material to be learned. Merrill classifies a learner's level of performance as: find, use, remember, and material content as: facts, concepts, procedures, and principles. The theory also calls upon four primary presentation forms and several other secondary presentation forms. The primary presentation forms include: rules, examples, recall, and practice. Secondary presentation forms include: prerequisites, objectives, helps, mnemonics, and feedback. A complete lesson includes a combination of primary and secondary presentation forms, but the most effective combination varies from learner to learner and also from concept to concept. Another significant aspect of the CDT model is that it allows for the learner to control the instructional strategies used and adapt them to meet his or her own learning style and preference. A major goal of this model was to reduce three common errors in concept formation: over-generalization, under-generalization and misconception.

Busy-hour call attempts

In telecommunications, busy-hour call attempts (BHCA) is a teletraffic engineering measurement used to evaluate and plan capacity for telephone networks. BHCA is the number of telephone calls attempted at the sliding 60-minute period during which occurs the maximum total traffic load in a given 24-hour period (BHCA), and the higher the BHCA, the higher the stress on the network processors. BHCA is not to be confused with busy hour call completion (BHCC) which measures the throughput capacity of the network. If a bottleneck in the network exists with a capacity lower than the estimated BHCA, then congestion will occur resulting in many failed calls and customer dissatisfaction. 
BHCA is usually used when planning telephone switching capacities and frequently goes side by side with the Erlang unit capacity calculation. As an example, a telephone exchange with a capacity of one million BHCA is estimated to handle 250,000 subscribers. The overall calculation is more complex however, and involves accounting for available circuits, desired blocking rates, and Erlang capacity allocated to each subscriber.
Determination.
The busy hour is determined by fitting a horizontal line segment equivalent to one hour under the traffic load curve about the peak load point. If the service time interval is less than 60 minutes, the busy hour is the 60-minute interval that contains the service timer interval. In cases where more than one busy hour occurs in a 24-hour period, "i.e.," when saturation occurs, the busy hour or hours most applicable to the particular situation are used.

Niels Christian Geelmuyden

Niels Christian Geelmuyden (born 18 December 1960) is a Norwegian journalist and writer, mostly known for his interviews and essays.
Geelmuyden grew up in Lysaker as a younger brother of Hans Geelmuyden. They were nephews of the writer Hans Geelmuyden. The Geelmuyden name is traced back to Dutch immigrants in the 1600s. Niels Christian Geelmuyden attended local schools before getting the cand.polit. degree in political science at the University of Oslo.
Geelmuyden was a columnist in the conservative newspapers and periodicals "Morgenbladet", "Farmand" and "Tidens Tegn". He mostly became known for his biographical portraits in interview form, which were mostly printed in "Kapital" and collected in several books. By 2016, the number of interviews had approached 600. Geelmuyden also wrote for other outlets, notably a 1993 portrait of Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland for "Det Nye". Growing frustrated with Brundtland's way of handling the media and her elusive verbal style, Geelmuyden decided to quote her exactly as she replied, which appeared wholly incoherent in print. The Office of the Prime Minister refused and "Det Nye" printed a "sanitized" version, prompting "Kapital" to print the "real" version.
In 2007, he received the Fritt Ord Honorary Award. Geelmuyden proceeded to write several critical books about the food industry. The first two were "Sannheten på bordet" (2013) and "Sannheten i glasset" (2015), regarding safety and additives in food and drink respectively. "Pillebefinnende" (2017) regarded the increased consumption of nutritional and medicinal pills.
Geelmuyden resides in Tjøme.

Jilawatan

Jilawatan (Urdu: جلاوطن, literal English translation: "exile") is the debut album by Pakistani rock band, Call. It was released on November 20, 2005 and gained huge popularity. It was the second album produced by the band's guitarist, Xulfi. The album was received with quite a bit of critical acclaim as well, spending over a year on the Vibes Charts.
Background.
The word Jilawatan means being exiled from one's country, state or mind. The album uses the word jilawatan in the context of being exiled from one's own mind. Xulfi said to MTV Moto:
The majority of the album is pretty heavy and features the drop-d tuning on guitar. The only exceptions to this are Sab Bhula Kai, Nishaan and Bichar Kai Bhee. Sab Bhula Kai and Bichar Kai Bhee feature guitars with the DADGAD (low to high) tuning whilst Nishaan's guitars feature the traditional EADGBE tuning. Almost all the tracks on the album have acoustic guitars except Shayad, Kuch Naheen, Jilawatan and Wujud and all of the tracks, with the exception of Pukaar and Jilawatan, feature guitar solos.
During live performances, the band plays several songs differently from the album. They usually include an unplugged version of Shayad, include a solo in Jilawatan, perform a completely different solo on Sab Bhula Kai and play the piano intro of Kismet a bit differently on guitars.
Track listing.
All songs composed and arranged by Zulfiqar J. Khan and Junaid Khan, except for Shayad and Bichar Kai Bhee music by Zulfiqar J. Khan and Jilawatan, Sab Bhula Kai and Wujud music by Sultan Raja, Zulfiqar J. Khan and Junaid Khan.

Target acquisition

Target acquisition is the detection and identification of the location of a target in sufficient detail to permit the effective employment of lethal and non-lethal means. The term is used for a broad area of applications. 
A "target" here is an entity or object considered for possible engagement or other action (see Targeting). Targets include a wide array of resources that an enemy commander can use to conduct operations including mobile and stationary units, forces, equipment, capabilities, facilities, persons and functions. It may comprise target acquisition, Joint Targeting or Information Operations. 
Technically target acquisition may just denote the process of a weapon system to decide which object to lock on to, as opposed to surveillance on one and target tracking on the other side; for example in an anti-aircraft system.
History.
Target acquisition under the doctrines of the Cold War and post–Cold War were focused on identifying the capabilities, assets and identities of large troop formations, air defense systems, artillery, rockets, missiles and identifying other High Pay-off Targets (HPTs) and High Value Targets (HVTs). HPTs, which if successfully engaged and neutralized, significantly contribute to the success of the "friendly commander's" course of action. HVT is a target that an "enemy commander" requires for completion of a mission. They both seem to accomplish the same, but are different when conducting the targeting analysis process.
Since the September 11 attacks, target acquisition has become a highly technical, robust and complex process because of the priority target types, including the targeting of individuals. Whereas a satellite can locate a missile launcher or a formation of 16 tanks by its shape, heat signature or size, it cannot identify and locate 1 of 7 billion individuals without having a person on the ground to recognize, report and engage that individual. This also requires an enhancement of Human Intelligence (HUMINT) sources or the enhancement of biometric technology for the purpose of positive identification of individuals in the targeting process. The Joint Targeting process is better suited for targeting individuals. The latest U.S. doctrine is the JP 3-60, "Joint Doctrine for Targeting".

Estadio Augusto César Sandino

Estadio Augusto César Sandino is a multi-use stadium in Santa Clara, Cuba. It is currently used mostly for baseball games and is the home stadium of Villa Clara Naranjas. The stadium holds 20,000 people.
Sandino Stadium "Orange fury" | La furia naranja, el estadio sandino de Santa Clara
La Furia Naranja (Orange Fury) is the nickname of Villa Clara province baseball team, the name was also given since 2009 to everything painted in orange throughout the city.
History and architecture.
The architects Emilio Castro and Gustavo R. Arnavat projected the Sandino in 1963 using the technique of articulated precast molding. In an effort to take the National Sport to every corner of the country, they were looking for a design solution that was less expensive and easier to adapt to the rest of Cuban cities without baseball facilities. It has an area of and capacity for 10,000 people. It opened on January 8, 1966.
The substructure is made out of concrete cast in-situ. Prefabricated structures such as vaults and PEPSA joints that hold the ceiling tiles were made using prefabricated reinforced concrete. The lobby's floor is tiled with Cuban marble, while the rest of the structure has polished concrete floor.
The gallery of the stadium has 148 columns from high sustaining 100 beams. It has ten lighting towers high with 320 bulbs of 1500 Watts. The stadium's water supply is provided by gravity from an elevated tank of 10,000 gallon capacity. It also has among its facilities a dorm room with 208 beds, nursery, bathrooms, lockers, warehouses and offices.
This structure's design was first built in Santa Clara city and subsequently repeated in the cities of Camagüey, Matanzas and Pinar del Rio. Then slowly to the rest of the country's cities and towns. The Cienfuego's stadium executed on September 5, 1977 is a good example of how the Sandino architectural typology could be re-adapted and slightly modified to create a similar looking building with some variants.
The stadium's namesake is Nicaraguan revolutionary Augusto César Sandino.

The Tainan Municipal Baseball Stadium () is a baseball stadium in South District,
Tainan, Taiwan. Situated in the South District, it is currently used mostly for professional baseball games, and has been the home stadium of Uni-President Lions since 1990.
History.
The stadium was built in 1931 at the site of a baseball field built during the Japanese period. The stadium underwent a series of refurbishment in the 1970s, and the light poles were installed in 1992 to enable the stadium for nighttime uses. Because the stadium is directly under the flight path of commercial airliners in and out of Tainan Airport, the building code limits the renovation that can be done to the stadium, resulting in sub-optimal placements of the light poles and support structures.
The stadium is currently under the management of the Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions organization since 1999, although the ownership is retained by the Tainan City Government. Chiayi-Tainan Luka of Taiwan Major League also occasionally played its home games here during its year of existence, although never officially naming it its home stadium.

History.
The William Penn Highway was organized as an alternative to the Lincoln Highway being parallel to the Pennsylvania Railroad west of Harrisburg. The route's New York City extension was adopted in 1916. The Pennsylvania Department of Highways assigned the PA 3 designation to this road in 1924, and, in 1926, it became part of US 22 when the U.S. Numbered Highway System was formed.
East of Harrisburg.
The first alignment of the William Penn Highway became problematic for motorists in Lebanon along the current US 422; Reading via US 22 and US 222 and Allentown on Hamilton Street, present-day PA 222. The highway continued through Allentown on Hanover Avenue and through Bethlehem on Broad Street, Linden Street, and Easton Avenue.
PA 43 was aligned as a bypass, north of the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, that ran from US 22, US 11, and PA 5 in Harrisburg east to PA 12 in Bethlehem. From Harrisburg, this route followed modern-day US 22 to Paxtonia, then Jonestown Road to Jonestown and modern-day Old Route 22, Airport Road, and Main Street through Fredericksburg. East of here to Fogelsville, the route is variously called Old Route 22, Shartlesville Road, and Hex Highway. The route from Fogelsville to the Allentown line, now Main Street and Tilghman Street, was designated Legislative Route 443 in 1925 before being incorporated into this route. The route entered Harrisburg by Liberty Street and connected with the William Penn Highway through 17th Street. "The New York Times" was recommending use of this cutoff by early 1931. On June 8, 1931, the American Association of State Highway Officials came to a resolution for the traffic problem, by replacing the PA 43 corridor with US 22. The Pennsylvania Department of Highways moved the William Penn Highway name to match. The state deleted a concurrency with PA 43 and what was then US 309 and truncated PA 43 to Susquehanna Street and Broadway from Allentown to Bethlehem. Signs were changed to reflect the new designations on May 31, 1932, with the new route designations officially in place on June 1, 1932.
Tilghman Street was eventually connected directly from Cetronia to Allentown by a bridge over Cedar Creek; Tilghman Street (west of the Lehigh River) and Union Boulevard (east of the river) were joined in 1929 by a bridge. By 1936, US 22 had been moved from its Hamilton and Broad streets alignment to Tilghman Street and Union Boulevard through Allentown and Bethlehem. From Bethlehem to Easton, an alternate route was formed along Goepp Street, Pembroke Road, and Freemansburg Avenue. With the construction of a new bridge over the Delaware River in 1938, Prospect Avenue, Pearl Street, and Snyder Street in Easton were incorporated into US 22. A new alignment from Fredericksburg to Paxtonia was built in the early 1940s. When the Lehigh Valley Thruway was completed in 1954, US 22 was moved onto it; its old alignment was redesignated State Route 1002 (SR 1002) through Lehigh County. With the completion of I-78, US 22 was moved onto that highway from Fredericksburg to Kuhnsville. The former alignment, although no longer a major state highway, is still well traveled by those who live in the vicinity.
I-78 originally would have continued with the US 22 concurrency on the Lehigh Valley Thruway into New Jersey, and I-178 and I-378, serving Allentown and Bethlehem, respectively. Due to opposition in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, on the building of a new highway through the town, the Pennsylvania and New Jersey departments of transportation decided to reroute I-78 to the south and allow US 22 to remain on the limited-access highway, which, after going through a series of sharp, potentially dangerous curves in Easton and crossing the Delaware River into New Jersey, becomes an at-grade divided highway in Phillipsburg.
West of Harrisburg.
The origins of this section of US 22 date back to the early 1800s, with the chartering of the Harrisburg, Lewistown, Huntingdon, and Pittsburgh Turnpike in 1807, following the course of what would become US 22 from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh, providing a more northerly alternative to the Harrisburg and Pittsburgh Turnpike chartered the year prior. Support for the turnpike was lacking along its route, and so, to foster a sense of locality to the road, the company was broken up in the subsequent years into five sections: the Huntingdon, Cambria, and Indiana in 1810 (terminating at Huntingdon and Blairsville); the New Alexandria and Conemaugh in 1816 (Blairsville to New Alexandria); the Pittsburgh and New Alexandria Turnpike in 1816; and the Harrisburg and Millerstown, Millerstown and Lewistown, and Lewistown and Huntingdon turnpikes in 1821. In their own times, these companies constructed a highway across the Appalachian Mountains collectively called the Northern Pike, but all folded with competition from the Main Line of Public Works and, later, the Pennsylvania Railroad.
In its earliest years, US 22 deviated from the original course of the William Penn Highway in a few notable places. With the construction of the Boulevard of the Allies in the early 1920s, the highway was rerouted to service this thoroughfare. This alignment entered Pittsburgh on modern day PA 8, then made its way downtown by Dallas Avenue, Wilkins Avenue, Beeler Street, Forbes Street, the Boulevard of the Allies, and Second Street. The highway then followed the old Pittsburgh and Steubenville Pike to Ohio. With the construction of the Penn-Lincoln Parkway in the late 1950s, both US 22 and US 30 were shifted to the new highway. 
Further east, where the William Penn Highway deviated from the Northern Pike between Ebensburg and Water Street to service Altoona and Tyrone, the Northern Pike was restored as the main east–west thoroughfare, while US 220 was chosen to service these cities. A few notable deviations from this include Turkey Valley Road near Canoe Creek Lake, and a bend servicing Williamsburg via modern-day PA 866 and SR 2015, which both deviated from the Northern Pike. These were later christened as PA 303 and PA 203 respectively when the highway was restored to the Northern Pike. Near the Susquehanna River, before an alignment along the Juniata River had been constructed, the highway serviced New Bloomfield and Meck's Corner by modern-day PA 34 and PA 274; while US 22 was shifted north, this alignment still held its old designation of PA 3 for some time afterward.
Future.
In 2011, it was announced that plans were being resurrected to widen US 22 from Allentown to Bethlehem. Part of the plan is to reconstruct the Lehigh River Bridge. The plan's cost is between $240 million to $320 million. In late 2019, plans to study a potential upgrade to an interstate were announced since additional federal funding is available for interstate construction.

Miles &amp; Monk at Newport

Miles &amp; Monk at Newport is a split album featuring separate performances by the Miles Davis sextet and the Thelonious Monk quartet at the Newport Jazz Festival. It was released in June 1964 by Columbia Records. Davis's set was recorded in 1958, and Monk's in 1963. Despite the album's title, the two artists do not perform together at either date.
On the first side of the LP was a series of high tempo performances of bebop tunes and other staples of the Davis live repertoire from 1958. The performance was contemporaneous with Davis' "Milestones" album. Aside from the 1973 release "Jazz at the Plaza" (also a 1958 concert) during the LP era, this was the only legitimate (non-bootleg) recording of a live Davis combo performance earlier than the 1960 Blackhawk recordings. As such, this performance and "Jazz at the Plaza" were the only legitimate live recordings representing the "Kind of Blue" sextet. On the second side were a few numbers by Thelonious Monk's combo, from a 1963 Newport appearance. It featured an idiosyncratic appearance by clarinetist Pee Wee Russell. The Miles set was recorded in mono and the Monk set was recorded in stereo, so the mono LP featured a fold-down of the Monk set and the stereo LP featured an electronically re-channeled for stereo remix of the Miles set.
In 1973, an expanded version of the Davis Newport performance was released as the LP "Miles &amp; Coltrane".
In 1994 the album was released with the Davis Newport performances expanded and the Monk portion released separately on the 2CD Monk compilation "At Newport 1963 &amp; 1965".

Little Brothers of St. Francis

The Little Brothers of St. Francis (originally founded as the Franciscan Brothers of Peace and Love) were members of a Roman Catholic institute of Religious Brothers founded in the Archdiocese of Boston on September 8, 1970, by Brother James T. Curran, L.B.S.F. (1932 - 2015). 
Canonically designated as a Private Association of the Faithful, the community was spiritually affiliated to the Province of the Immaculate Conception of the Order of Friars Minor. Striving to be poor in spirit, they worked to serve the needs of the homeless primarily through prayer and presence. They followed a contemplative life based on the Rule of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis, also influenced by the "Rule for Hermitages" written by St. Francis of Assisi. The community disbanded in 2013.
History.
James T. Curran was born in Boston, Massachusetts on June 13, 1932, the son of James P. and Anna V. Diffley Curran. He grew up in the North End and was an active member of St. Leonard's parish. He attended Boston University and for a number of years performed with the National Opera Company. He felt called to follow a life of prayer and service among the poor. In this goal, he was guided by the Franciscan friars of Immaculate Conception Province who provided him fraternal support and spiritual direction. On September 9, 1951, he professed vows as a Franciscan tertiary (Secular Franciscan).
In 1970 Curran founded the "Franciscan Brothers of Peace and Love", and in 1976 changed its name to the "Little Brothers of St. Francis" to minister to Boston's homeless. The first home of the community was his apartment on Beacon Hill in downtown Boston. He eventually gained the blessing of the Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Humberto Medeiros, who was himself a member of the Third Order of St. Francis (Secular Franciscan Order). The cardinal allowed him to take religious vows and to wear a Franciscan habit, even though he was alone at that point. He soon adopted a habit made of denim, which quickly became the distinguishing mark of the community, earning them the nickname of the "Blue jeans Franciscans."
Curran's way of life was to keep working at his job while spending several hours in prayer before the Blessed Sacrament. He then would go out among the homeless who would congregate in downtown Boston, especially around the Boston Common, and distribute peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, coffee, underwear, T-shirts, and white cotton socks. As other men came to join him, the community eventually relocated to a house in the Mission Hill section of Boston, among the city's poorest. The community never grew large, however, numbering seven Brothers at its peak around 2008.
In 2006, Curran received the Institute on Religious Life's "Pro Fidelitate et Virtute" Award for his fidelity to his vocation as a religious brother and for supporting the IRL as a board member, coordinator of the Boston Regional Meeting, and as chairman of the Forum of Superiors of Men's Communities.
On November 23, 2008, the Archdiocese of Boston awarded Curran the Cheverus Award Medal in order to recognize his service to the Church and to God's people.
On August 29, 2009, four members of the Little Brothers of St. Francis were invited by Cardinal Seán Patrick O'Malley, Archbishop of Boston, to serve as acolytes at the Funeral Mass of Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy. The Mass was held at the Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, the parish to which the Little Brothers of St. Francis' belonged and where they attended daily Mass.
In 2012, due to declining health, Brother James became a resident of the Don Orione Nursing Home in East Boston. In the community's last newsletter of November 2012, it was announced that the community was disbanding. Another religious congregation, the Brotherhood of Hope, has acquired the property at 785-789 Parker Street, Mission Hill, MA.
Brother James died on June 28, 2015, at St. Joseph Manor Health Care in Brockton, Massachusetts at the age of eighty-three. The Mass of Christian Burial was held at Mission Church (Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help) in Roxbury, MA on July 1, 2015. Interment was held at Mount Benedict Cemetery in West Roxbury, MA.
Over the years, in addition to befriending large numbers of Boston's homeless men and women, the Little Brothers also befriended and were befriended by many well-known Catholic priests, religious, and humanitarians, including: Dom Basil Pennington, O.C.S.O., Ade Bethune, Mother Antonia Brenner, Mother Teresa, Jean Vanier, Little Sister Magdeleine of Jesus, Fr. Benedict Groeschel, Fr. John Hardon, and several others.

Masamichi Noro

 was a Japanese aikido teacher and the founder of Kinomichi.
Formative Years.
Masamichi Noro was born January 21, 1935, in Aomori, Japan. His education destined him to be medical doctor, but one encounter re-directed the course of his life toward the martial arts, irrevocably. In 1955, while pursuing university studies, his uncle arranged for him to be presented to the founder of Aikido, Morihei Ueshiba. This event proved to be decisive and that same day he decided to renounce his plans in order to become uchi deshi, an internal student of this master. His training, in the ancient manner, took place night and day at the master’s side. In this way, from 1955 to 1961, Masamichi Noro followed Morehei Ueshiba from Tokyo to Iwama where he had his private dojo. At this time, 5 uchi deshi (including Yasuo Kobayashi and Nobuyoshi Tamura) encircled the founder of Aikido, and from this breeding ground sprung the generation which would form a great part of Aïkido worldwide.
The Propagation of Aikido.
In 1961, Morihei Ueshiba wished to send an expert to Europe and entrusted his disciple Masamichi Noro, who by that time had received the 6th dan, the responsibility of supporting the enthusiasm and training of the European and African practitioners. So, he was urged by Morihei Ueshiba to embark toward the West with the title "Official Delegate for Europe and Africa". It has been noted that from this time, he renounced all dan above the 6th that had been given to him by his master. He followed the sea route of the time, passing the Suez Canal and the Pyramids to land at Marseille on September 3, 1961. The beginning was difficult. The art was new and the way of teaching it very different from the way it was taught in his master’s dojo. Everything had to be structured, understood and made accessible to the western body and mind. Masamichi Noro deployed his initial energy in southeastern France and in Italy where Judo teachers had invited him to enrich the understanding of their students. The spirit was one of mutual assistance and pleasure in the study, following the wishes of Jigoro Kano, the founder of Judo. Then he was invited to Belgium. He opened his first dojo there. In ploughing these new lands for the budōs he opened more than 200 dojos, as many in Europe as in Africa, flying from Sweden to Senegal. This was a time of pioneers. Mutsuro Nakazono and Nobuyoshi Tamura joined him in 1963 and 1964, respectively. The task was immense, the success exemplary. In 1964, Masamichi Noro established his base in Paris and opened a succession of dojos which left their imprint within the heart of the French aikidokas : at the Gare du Nord, rue de Constance, rue des Petits Hôtels. In the Parisian melting pot, Masamichi Noro met Taisen Deshimaru, Karlfried Graf Dürckheim, Marie-Thérèse Foix, Gisèle de Noiret and Docteur Lily Ehrenfried. He opened himself to new ideas, to original perspectives, to occidental techniques.
The Creation of Kinomichi.
The Second Beginning.
In 1979, after a discussion with Kisshomaru Ueshiba, the son of the founder of Aikido, Masamichi Noro created Kinomichi® in order to further extend his quest. There followed a new succession of Parisian dojos dedicated to the study of Kinomichi : rue Logelbach, boulevard de Strasbourg, boulevard des Batignolles. After an inevitable period of adjustments and intense research, the links between Kinomichi® and Aikido developed and deepened.
A Community of Budōs.
1995, at the time of the 20th anniversary of Aikido in Germany and at the invitation of his friend Katsuaki Asai, 8th dan Aïkikaï and pioneer of Aikido in Germany, he presented Kinomichi® before a gathering of the greatest masters of Aikido, including the Doshu. From 1996, he made frequent visits to the Aikikai Foundation in Tokyo and, of course, to Kishomaru Ueshiba, the son of Aikido’s founder. In 2001, he obtained recognition from the ministry of youth and sports (Ministère de la Jeunesse et des Sports) of Kinomichi® as an official sporting discipline. In 2004, he participated in the events celebrating the 20th anniversary of the , FFAAA, which welcomed the Moriteru Ueshiba, representative of the Centre Mondial de l’Aïkido in Tokyo. Masamichi Noro, Nobuyoshi Tamura and Christian Tissier were notably present to receive the delegation from the Hombu Dojo of Tokyo. They were among 3000 practitioners from all of France as well as numerous European countries. April 8, 2005, he was invited with Master Christian Tissier to participate in a workshop organized by the association Hakki for the benefit of the 220,000 victims of the tsunami of December 26, 2004. In 2007, at the initiative of the FFAAA, he welcomed into his Parisian dojo Japanese masters, including Isoyama. On March 15, 2013, Noro Masamichi died.
An ever evolving creation.
Since its creation, Kinomichi® has known 3 phases and Masamichi Noro emphasized to tell his students that his art was ever evolving. The 1980s were characterized by focusing the work on sensitivity, on a correct and relaxed posture, and on the body as an instrument of perception of the self, others and the world. The 90s accented the orientation of the ki and organized the movement to initiate from the ground. 2000 opened onto a period where the technical richness was to be studied in different degrees of speed, difficulty and freedom. Each level is seen not as inferior to the one that follows but like a pathway to that which comes next, like a call to advance. Masamichi Noro accented the heart, shin 心, in particular. He created access to his art through the work on the breath, ki 気. He demanded, at the highest level, that the ki be oriented by the shin, the breath by the heart and that it should be closely bound to technical expertise. Masamichi Noro deployed his energy to create a discipline that opens onto his becoming, following the example of his own master. Morihei Ueshiba never ceased transforming his art, to the point of having given his art 7 different names, like so many milestones along the Way. In this manner, Masamichi Noro took to heart the etymology of dojo 道場, the place where one studies the Way, Do 道 in Japanese and Tao in Chinese.
Successor and descendants.
Following the death of Noro Masamichi sensei, his son Noro Takeharu sensei continues the teaching of Kinomichi according to his father's wish.
In Germany, the Aikido of Asai Katsuaki sensei, 8th dan Aikikai, maintains a strong influence of the art of Noro Masamichi sensei.
Many Aikido experts like to quote Noro Masamichi sensei as their master or one of their masters:
Nguyen Thanh Thien sensei, a student of Noro Masamichi sensei, has created the Ringenkai Aikido as an offspring Noro Masamichi sensei's teaching.
The KIIA, an independent group, brings together former students of Noro Masamichi sensei (FFAAA technical committee : Christian Bleyer, Jean Pierre Cortier, Lucien Forni, Françoise Paumard, Martine Pillet, Hubert Thomas, Françoise Weidmann). DNBK, Dai Nippon Butoku General Kai Corporation, has certified Noro Masamichi sensei's followers as Shihan Aikido Hanshi :

Shirley Jean Rickert

Shirley Jean Rickert (March 25, 1926 – February 6, 2009) was an American child actress who was briefly the "blonde girl" for the "Our Gang" series in 1931, during the Hal Roach early talkie period.
Career.
At 18 months of age, Rickert won a local baby beauty contest, which emboldened her mother to move the family to Hollywood. She made her screen debut at the age of four in the short "How's My Baby" (1930), soon followed by her "Our Gang" debut, "Helping Grandma" in 1931. Rickert's most notable appearances were in the films "Love Business" and "Bargain Day", in which her spit-curls, inspired by those of Ruth Taylor's in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", were the centerpiece of her precocious performance.
After Rickert left the "Our Gang" series, she had a brief movie career, including starring roles as Tomboy Teri Taylor alongside Mickey Rooney in eight "Mickey McGuire" comedies, followed by a string of jobs including driving trucks for the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. She later worked in burlesque as an exotic dancer, billed as Gilda and Her Crowning Glory (after her long blonde hair), retiring from burlesque in 1959.

Later, she performed in local theater productions, helped to maintain a Web fansite, and made occasional public appearances. She also sold her crafts at a local shop with her daughter's family.
Death.
Rickert died in a nursing home on February 6, 2009, after a long illness. She was 82.

That's What Love Is For

"That's What Love Is For" is a song by Christian music/pop music-crossover singer Amy Grant. It was written by three-time Grammy-Award winner Michael Omartian, Mark Mueller and Amy Grant and produced by Omartian. It was the third Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 pop single from her 5× platinum-selling album "Heart in Motion" and the only one from the album to be released to both Pop and Christian radio.
The song topped "Billboard" Adult Contemporary chart and was No. 1 for three weeks, starting the week of November 29, 1991. It spent a total of 13 weeks in the Top 10 and 32 weeks on the chart overall. The song peaked at No. 7 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 the week of November 23, 1991 and ultimately spent four weeks in the Top 10. It finished the 1992 "Billboard" Year-End Hot 100 Singles chart ranked at No. 91. In Canada, the song also topped the charts, reaching No. 1 on the "RPM Magazine" Adult Contemporary Chart. It peaked at No. 7 on the Pop Chart and was No. 61 on the "RPM Magazine"s Canadian Top 100 Singles Year-End Chart for 1991.
There are two versions of the song, the album cut and the pop radio edit. For pop radio airplay, the strings were removed and the song was remixed with a new rhythm track.
Music video.
A music video was produced to promote the single, and mixes shots of Grant wearing a red cloak and singing to the camera, while other shots of her singing are in black and white. The music video was filmed at the Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve in Idaho. It also features a male/female couple, sitting together on a bench but not looking at each other. At the 3:12 mark of the video (just after Grant sings the bridge leading into the last chorus), the couple are seen in black and white, holding each other loosely while the music plays and Grant sings. The video fades out on a shot of Grant singing ad-libs in front of a sepia-toned background. Off in the distance is the man, and further off, presumably the woman. Behind them all are four large letters which spell the word "LOVE".
There are two versions of this video. One version has additional shots of Amy. One where she is in a giant, tall green dress. Another shot shows a black &amp; white close up of Amy in a very retro-mod hair style.

Headway

Headway is the distance or duration between vehicles in a transit system. The "minimum headway" is the shortest such distance or time achievable by a system without a reduction in the speed of vehicles. The precise definition varies depending on the application, but it is most commonly measured as the distance from the tip (front end) of one vehicle to the tip of the next one behind it. It can be expressed as the distance between vehicles, or as time it will take for the trailing vehicle to cover that distance. A "shorter" headway signifies closer spacing between the vehicles. Airplanes operate with headways measured in hours or days, freight trains and commuter rail systems might have headways measured in parts of an hour, metro and light rail systems operate with headways on the order of 90 seconds to 20 minutes, and vehicles on a freeway can have as little as 2 seconds headway between them.
Headway is a key input in calculating the overall route capacity of any transit system. A system that requires large headways has more empty space than passenger capacity, which lowers the total number of passengers or cargo quantity being transported for a given length of line (railroad or highway, for instance). In this case, the capacity has to be improved through the use of larger vehicles. On the other end of the scale, a system with short headways, like cars on a freeway, can offer relatively large capacities even though the vehicles carry few passengers.
The term is most often applied to rail transport and bus transport, where low headways are often needed to move large numbers of people in mass transit railways and bus rapid transit systems. A lower headway requires more infrastructure, making lower headways expensive to achieve. Modern large cities require passenger rail systems with tremendous capacity, and low headways allow passenger demand to be met in all but the busiest cities. Newer signalling systems and moving block controls have significantly reduced headways in modern systems compared to the same lines only a few years ago. In principle, automated personal rapid transit systems and automobile platoons could reduce headways to as little as fractions of a second.
Description.
Different measures.
There are a number of different ways to measure and express the same concept, the distance between vehicles. The differences are largely due to historical development in different countries or fields.
The term developed from railway use, where the distance between the trains was very great compared to the length of the train itself. Measuring headway from the front of one train to the front of the next was simple and consistent with timetable scheduling of trains, but constraining tip-to-tip headway does not always ensure safety. In the case of a metro system, train lengths are uniformly short and the headway allowed for stopping is much longer, so tip-to-tip headway may be used with a minor safety factor. Where vehicle size varies and may be longer than their stopping distances or spacing, as with freight trains and highway applications, tip-to-tail measurements are more common.
The units of measure also vary. The most common terminology is to use the time of passing from one vehicle to the next, which closely mirrors the way the headways were measured in the past. A timer is started when one train passes a point, and then measures time until the next one passes, giving the tip-to-tip time. This same measure can also be expressed in terms of vehicles-per-hour, which is used on the Moscow Metro for instance. Distance measurements are somewhat common in non-train applications, like vehicles on a road, but time measurements are common here as well.
Railway examples.
Train movements in most rail systems are tightly controlled by railway signalling systems. In many railways drivers are given instructions on speeds, and routes through the rail network. Trains can only accelerate and decelerate relatively slowly, so stopping from anything but low speeds requires several hundred metres or even more. The track distance required to stop is often much longer than the range of the driver's vision. If the track ahead is obstructed, for example a train is at stop there, then the train behind it will probably see it far too late to avoid a collision.
Signalling systems serve to provide drivers with information on the state of the track ahead, so that a collision may be avoided. A side effect of this important safety function is that the headway of any rail system is effectively determined by the structure of the signalling system, and particularly the spacing between signals and the amount of information that can be provided in the signal. Rail system headways can be calculated from the signalling system. In practice there are a variety of different methods of keeping trains apart, some which are manual such as train order working or systems involving telegraphs, and others which rely entirely on signalling infrastructure to regulate train movements. Manual systems of working trains are common in area with low numbers of train movements, and headways are more often discussed in the context of non-manual systems.
For automatic block signalling (ABS), the headway is measured in minutes, and calculated from the time from the passage of a train to when the signalling system returns to full clear (proceed). It is not normally measured tip to tip. An ABS system divides the track into block sections, into which only one train can enter at a time. Commonly trains are kept two to three block sections apart, depending on how the signalling system is designed, and so the length of the block section will often determine the headway.
To have visual contact as a method to avoid collision (such as during shunting) is done only at low speeds, like 40 km/h. A key safety factor of train operations is to space the trains out by at least this distance, the "brick-wall stop" criterion. In order to signal the trains in time to allow them to stop, the railways placed workmen on the lines who timed the passing of a train, and then signalled any following trains if a certain elapsed time had not passed. This is why train headways are normally measured as tip-to-tip times, because the clock was reset as the engine passed the workman.
As remote signalling systems were invented, the workmen were replaced with signal towers at set locations along the track. This broke the track into a series of block sections between the towers. Trains were not allowed to enter a section until the signal said it was clear. This had the side-effect of limiting the maximum speed of the trains to the speed where they could stop in the distance of one block section. This was an important consideration for the Advanced Passenger Train in the United Kingdom, where the lengths of block sections limited speeds and demanded a new braking system be developed.
There is no perfect block-section size for the block-control approach. Longer sections, using as few signals as possible, are advantageous because signals are expensive and are points of failure, and they allow higher speeds because the trains have more room to stop. On the other hand, they also increase the headway, and thus reduce the overall capacity of the line. These needs have to be balanced on a case-by-case basis.
Other examples.
In the case of automobile traffic, the key consideration in braking performance is the user's reaction time. Unlike the train case, the stopping distance is generally much shorter than the spotting distance. That means that the driver will be matching their speed to the vehicle in front before they reach it, eliminating the "brick-wall" effect.
Widely used numbers are that a car traveling at 60 mph will require about 225 feet to stop, a distance it will cover just under 6 seconds. Nevertheless, highway travel often occurs with considerable safety with tip-to-tail headways on the order of 2 seconds. That's because the user's reaction time is about 1.5 seconds so 2 seconds allows for a slight overlap that makes up for any difference in braking performance between the two cars.
Various personal rapid transit systems in the 1970s considerably reduced the headways compared to earlier rail systems. Under computer control, reaction times can be reduced to fractions of a second. Whether traditional headway regulations should apply to PRT and car train technology is debatable. In the case of the Cabinentaxi system developed in Germany, headways were set to 1.9 seconds because the developers were forced to adhere to the brick-wall criterion. In experiments, they demonstrated headways on the order of half of a second.
In 2017, in the UK, 66% of cars and Light Commercial Vehicles, and 60% of motorcycles left the recommended two-second gap between themselves and other vehicles.
Low-headway systems.
Headway spacing is selected by various safety criteria, but the basic concept remains the same – leave enough time for the vehicle to safely stop behind the vehicle in front of it. The "safely stop" criterion has a non-obvious solution, however; if a vehicle follows immediately behind the one in front, the vehicle in front simply cannot stop quickly enough to damage the vehicle behind it. An example would be a conventional train, where the vehicles are held together and have only a few millimetres of "play" in the couplings. Even when the locomotive applies emergency braking, the cars following do not suffer any damage because they quickly close the gap in the couplings before the speed difference can build up.
There have been many experiments with automated driving systems that follow this logic and greatly decrease headways to tenths or hundredths of a second in order to improve safety. Today, modern CBTC railway signalling systems are able to significantly reduce headway between trains in the operation. Using automated "car follower" cruise control systems, vehicles can be formed into platoons (or flocks) that approximate the capacity of conventional trains. These systems were first employed as part of personal rapid transit research, but later using conventional cars with autopilot-like systems.
Paris Métro Line 14 runs with headways as low as 85 seconds, while several lines of the Moscow Metro have peak hour headways of 90 seconds.
Headway and route capacity.
Route capacity is defined by three figures; the number of passengers (or weight of cargo) per vehicle, the maximum safe speed of the vehicles, and the number of vehicles per unit time.
Since the headway factors into two of the three inputs, it is a primary consideration in capacity calculations. The headway, in turn, is defined by the braking performance, or some external factor based on it, like block sizes. Following the methods in Anderson:
Minimum safe headway.
The minimum safe headway measured tip-to-tail is defined by the braking performance:
formula_1
where:
The tip-to-tip headway is simply the tip-to-tail headway plus the length of the vehicle, expressed in time:
formula_9
where:
Capacity.
The vehicular capacity of a single lane of vehicles is simply the inverse of the tip-to-tip headway. This is most often expressed in vehicles-per-hour:
formula_12
where:
The passenger capacity of the lane is simply the product of vehicle capacity and the passenger capacity of the vehicles:
formula_15
where:
Examples.
Consider these examples:
1) freeway traffic, per lane: 100 km/h (~28 m/s) speeds, 4 passengers per vehicle, 4 meter vehicle length, 2.5 m/s^2 braking (1/4 "g"), 2 second reaction time, brick-wall stop, formula_8 of 1.5;
The headway used in reality is much less than 10.5 seconds, since the brick-wall principle is not used on freeways. In reality, 1.5 persons per car and 2 seconds headway can be assumed, giving 1800 cars or 2700 passengers per lane and hour.
For comparison, the Marin County, California (near San Francisco) states that peak flow on the three-lane Highway 101 is about 7,200 "vehicles" per hour. This is about the same number of passengers per lane.
Notwithstanding these formulas it is widely known that reducing headway increases risk of collision in standard private automobile settings and is often referred to as tailgating.
2) metro system, per line: 40 km/h (~11 m/s) speeds, 1000 passengers, 100 meter vehicle length, 0.5 m/s^2 braking, 2 second reaction time, brick-wall stop, formula_8 of 1.5;
Note that most signalling systems used on metros place an artificial limit on headway that is not dependent on braking performance. Also the time needed for station stops limits the headway. Using a typical figure of 2 minutes (120 seconds):
Since the headway of a metro is constrained by signalling considerations, not vehicle performance, reductions in headway through improved signalling have a direct impact on passenger capacity. For this reason, the London Underground system has spent a considerable amount of money on upgrading the SSR Network, Jubilee and Central lines with new CBTC signalling to reduce the headway from about 3 minutes to 1, while preparing for the 2012 Olympics.
3) automated personal rapid transit system, 30 km/h (~8 m/s) speeds, 3 passengers, 3 meter vehicle length, 2.5 m/s^2 braking (1/4 "g"), 0.01 second reaction time, brake-failure on lead vehicle for 1 m/s slowing, bot 2.5, m/s if lead vehicle breaks. formula_8 of 1.1;
This number is similar to the ones proposed by the Cabinentaxi system, although they predicted that actual use would be much lower. Although PRTs have less passenger seating and speeds, their shorter headways dramatically improve passenger capacity. However, these systems are often constrained by brick-wall considerations for legal reasons, which limits their performance to a car-like 2 seconds. In this case:
Headways and ridership.
Headways have an enormous impact on ridership levels above a certain critical waiting time. Following Boyle, the effect of changes in headway are directly proportional to changes in ridership by a simple conversion factor of 1.5. That is, if a headway is reduced from 12 to 10 minutes, the average rider wait time will decrease by 1 minute, the overall trip time by the same one minute, so the ridership increase will be on the order of 1 x 1.5 + 1 or about 2.5%. Also see Ceder for an extensive discussion.

Halifax Rainmen

The Halifax Rainmen were a professional basketball team based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. They played in the Atlantic Division of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) and their home games took place at the Scotiabank Centre, formerly known as the Halifax Metro Centre. Andre Levingston was the owner of the Rainmen since he helped establish the team in 2006. The team played their first season in the American Basketball Association (ABA). However, after becoming unhappy with the ABA, they moved to the Premier Basketball League (PBL) for the next three seasons. In 2011, they joined the NBL Canada as one of the original seven teams. Despite showing success in the four seasons they spent in the Canadian league, making two Finals appearances, the Rainmen filed for bankruptcy in July 2015. The team was coming off a controversial loss in the 2015 NBL Canada Finals against the Windsor Express and forfeited Game 7 after taking part in a pre-game brawl. The Halifax Hurricanes, with a larger ownership group than the Rainmen's single owner, replaced the Rainmen in NBL Canada for the 2015–16 season.
History.
The American Basketball Association announced on August 23, 2006, that Halifax, Nova Scotia, had been granted an expansion franchise for the 2007–08 season. A local contest was later held among fans to help name the team, and on December 19, 2006, the organization unveiled that they would be known as the Halifax Rainmen.
The Rainmen hosted the 2007 ABA All-Star Game ten months before the team started play. Joe Newman, the league's chairman, figured it would be an excellent way to promote Canadian expansion.
On May 30, 2007, the team announced their home venue, the Halifax Metro Centre, and head coach, Kevin MaBone. Mabone later stepped down due to a family illness and was replaced as head coach by Rick Lewis. Shannon Hansen and Daniel Freiberg joined Lewis on the coaching staff as assistants.
The Rainmen's first two player signings were Peter Benoite and Chad Eichelberger. Benoite was a former CIS standout for the Memorial Sea-Hawks, and is currently the Sea-Hawks head coach.
Days before their first game, the Rainmen announced the signing of star Canadian guard Jermaine Anderson, a veteran member of the Canadian National basketball team.
2007–08 season.
The Rainmen played their inaugural season in the Northeast Division of the Blue Conference in the American Basketball Association. The team won its first-ever game on November 15, 2007 at the Metro Center, against the Boston Blizzard by a score of 136-103, in front of 4,343 fans. Halifax went on to lose seven straight before their next win, against the Montreal Royal. The Rainmen ended the season with a record of 12 wins and 20 losses.
Eric Crookshank led the Rainmen during the season, averaging 20.5 points and 12.3 rebounds per game. He was also named to the All-ABA first team. Crookshank and Brian Silverhorn were both chosen to represent the Rainmen at the 2008 ABA All-Star Weekend, in Vermont. Halifax lead the American Basketball Association in attendance during the year.
On March 19, 2008, the Rainmen withdrew from the ABA due to the ownership's dissatisfaction with the league's management. The team announced their intention to pursue membership in the NBA Development League. D-League president, Dan Reed, visited Halifax and the Metro Centre. While he stated was impressed with the city, owner, and arena, he said that for travel costs and other reasons, 2008–09 expansion would be unlikely, and a more likely expansion target would be the 2009–10 season. On June 23, the Rainmen joined the Premier Basketball League.
2009 season.
The Rainmen kicked off their inaugural PBL season by placing former Rainmen Eric Crookshank, Kadiri Richard, Brian Silverhorn and Jimmy Twyman on their protected players list, giving them exclusive PBL negotiating rights to the four. Halifax then received the second overall pick in the PBL Entry Draft, held in Chicago, Illinois. With the pick the Rainmen selected former Acadia Axemen all-star Walter Moyse. With their second-round pick, Halifax selected David Bailey, formerly of the Maryland Nighthawks. Ultimately, Moyse could not come to terms with the team.
In early November 2008, the Rainmen signed Bailey for the 2009 season, along with former ABA All-Stars Rob Sanders, a former Manchester Millrat, and Cordell Jeanty, formerly of the Montreal Royal. Jimmy Twyman and Brian Silverhorn returned to the team along with newcomers Kevin Hammack and Tyronne McNeal. Forward Kadiri Richard was granted a release and was signed by PBL rival the Wilmington Sea Dawgs.
On November 17, the Rainmen re-signed All-Star Eric Crookshank, who had turned down offers from the Vermont Frost Heaves and various overseas teams to sign with the Rainmen. Later that month, the Rainmen signed Jason McGriff, Rodney Mayes and Canadian Jabulah Murray. McGriff and Murray failed to report to the team. With training camp underway, the Rainmen signed shooting guard Glen Dandridge, a former three-year member of the University of Missouri basketball program, to fill the void left by their departures.
Halifax won in their Premier Basketball League opener 110-108 versus the hosting Quebec Kebs on January 2, 2009. Earlier in the day, the Rainmen signed guard Zach Ramey, formerly of the Rockford Fury. The Rainmen played their home-opener seven days later against the Kebs, winning in front of over 4,000 fans.
On January 14, the team suspended star Eric Crookshank for the season, with pay, following a series of conflicts with Coach Rick Lewis. The Rainmen did not comment on the cause.
On February 3, the team released Rick Lewis, the head coach and general manager, citing poor results in weekend games at Vermont and Manchester. The team's record was 6-5 at that point, dropping the Rainmen a game behind in a tight divisional race with Vermont and Manchester. Rodney Mayes, one of the last of the players signed in late November, was also released. Assistant Shannon Hanson served briefly as interim head coach. Following Lewis' dismissal, Crookshank was reinstated.
On February 5, the Rainmen announced Halifax native Les Berry as the new head coach. Berry previously led Acadia University within one win of the national CIS Men's Basketball championship. The team was then bolstered by the signings of guard Tony Bennett who played his college ball at Bradley University and PBL leading scorer A.J. Millien. Although Berry led the team to a record of 6 wins and 3 losses, the Rainmen failed to qualify for the PBL playoffs.
Following the season, Millien was named "PBL Newcomer of the Year" while Tony Bennett was named to the PBL All-Defensive team.
2010 season.
The Rainmen's first move of the 2010 season was to re-sign coach Les Berry. Berry and team owner Andre Levingston began recruiting during the offseason and signed a number of players, including former NBA'er Desmond Ferguson. Tony Bennett, Eric Crookshank, and John Strickland were all re-signed for the 2010 season.
2011 season.
During the pre-season, the Rainmen added Kavon Jones, Josh Dollard, Tajuan Porter, Mike Mercer, Marshall Brown and Tommy Mitchell while welcoming back veteran players Eric Crookshank and Desmond Ferguson to the roster. The Rainmen also re-signed 6'1 point guard Taliek Brown, who joined the team during the 2010 season but did not play due to a family emergency.
On January 14, the organization added former NBA Development League Forward/Centre James "Boo" Jackson to their lineup.
On January 22, the Rainmen announced the addition of Kirk Snyder to their roster but after playing three games between January 23–30, they waived him.
On January 24, Les Berry's tenure as Head Coach of the Halifax Rainmen ended by mutual consent. While the Rainmen had been pleased with Berry's performance, the decision for his resignation came after he was presented with an opportunity to build his career outside of the sports arena. Two days later, former NBA player, scout and coach Mike Evans was named as head coach of the Rainmen for the remainder of the 2011 season.
The Rainmen ended their 2011 season as the fourth place team in the PBL after falling to the Lawton Fort Sill Cavalry in the final game of their series (1-2). In the first game of the series, the Cavalry beat the Rainmen in Halifax by one point in overtime. Four days later, the Rainmen beat the Cavalry by ten points in Oklahoma, where the Cavalry had not lost in three years.
After the controversy surrounding the Rochester Razorsharks's advancement through the PBL playoffs, the Rainmen joined the Saint John Mill Rats in disassociating themselves from the PBL within one hour after the playoffs ended. The decision to withdraw from the league was made upon the Rochester RazorSharks being crowned as PBL champions over the Lawton Fort-Sill Cavalry, with controversies over the officiating of games, as the RazorSharks and the league share a common owner. Rainmen owner Andre Levingston was quoted as saying, "I am appalled by the officiating that took place during the playoffs, and am ashamed of the PBL's operations this season. I want nothing but the best for our city, our fans, our sponsors, and our players, and I can say with confidence that the best is no longer found in the PBL." The Quebec Kebs followed suit one day later.
On May 12, 2011, the Rainmen, Mill Rats, and Kebs founded the National Basketball League of Canada.
2011–12 season.
The Rainmen were one of seven teams competing in NBL Canada's inaugural season, joining past PBL rivals the Quebec Kebs and Saint John Mill Rats along with new teams the London Lightning, Moncton Miracles Oshawa Power, and Summerside Storm. The head coach was Pep Claros.
Before the season, the Rainmen signed Halifax native, 6'0 guard, Christian Upshaw. Upshaw was the third-highest scorer in the Atlantic University Sport the previous year, averaging 18.9 points a game for St. Francis Xavier University (St. FX). In 2009–2010, Upshaw was named MVP of the AUS and was a CIS All-Canadian.
Due to a violation of league and club policies, the Rainmen suspended centre DeAndre Thomas indefinitely and forward Eric Crookshank for one game.
The Rainmen signed 6'1 Canadian guard Joey Haywood. Haywood attended Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia and went on to become the leading scorer for three straight years in the CIS. The previous season he averaged 28.9 points a game and earned the title of MVP in the AUS.
The Halifax Rainmen added former NBA players Orien Greene and Richard Delk to their roster. The Rainmen also made their first trade of the season, trading former NBA player Rodney Buford to the London Lightning in exchange for 6'6" forward Tyrone Levett.
The Rainmen signed 6'9 centre Stevy Worah-Ozimo, but waived him days after. They also activated 6'9 centre and former NBA player Eddie Robinson.
The Halifax Rainmen added 5'9 guard Chris Hagan to the roster and released Richard Delk. Hagan played NCAA Div-1 basketball at Midwestern State University and professionally in New Zealand.
The Halifax Rainmen released their 2011 draft pick, 6'4 Canadian Papa Oppong, and the ex-NBA player Orien Greene.
The Rainmen signed 6'9 Canadian Troy Gottselig and placed Abdullahi Kuso on injury reserved. Gottselig was later released after the signing of forward Richard Anderson. The Rainmen continued to make moves as they released ex-NBA player Eddie Robinson and activated Abduhalli Kuso from the injured reserve list.
The Halifax Rainmen signed Darnell Hugee as well as waiving guard Darrin Dorsey.
Taliek Brown, Canadian Joey Haywood and Tyrone Levett were all selected to participate in the 2012 NBL All-star game.
Lawrence Wright led the Rainmen in scoring with 15.41 ppg. Taliek Brown proved to be a true point with his team-leading 3.05 apg and fan favorite Eric Crookshank grabbed 6.88 rpg.
By the end of the regular season, the Rainmen finishedsecond in the NBL Canada standings and were in good position to make a run at the title. They defeated the Quebec Kebs in the first round of the playoffs. They then went on to face the London Lightning in the finals. Coming back from a 2-0 start which included a huge comeback in the last seconds of game 3, the Rainmen tied the series 2-2. They lost the series 3-2.
After the season, Chris Hagan, Lawrence Wright and Abduhalli Kuso all chose to sign to other teams.
On August 27, the second annual NBL Canada draft took place. The Rainmen did not have a first-round pick due to an early trade in the season but held the seventh pick in the second round. The Rainmen drafted 6'2 guard Courtland Bluford. After the draft, the Rainmen announced they traded Tyrone Levett and Christian "T-Bear" Upshaw to the Moncton Miracles for their first-round draft pick Anthony Johnson. The Rainmen also landed guard Brandon Robinson from the Oshawa Power for cash and a 2013 third-round pick. Robinson was the Rookie of the Year in 2011–2012 and averaged a league best 19.86 ppg. After the draft, owner Andre Levingston commented on the draft trades. "Robinson led our league in scoring last year and is probably the best two guard in our league. He's a very explosive guy. He can score in different facets of the game. He's definitely going to add an element to our game that we lacked last year, which was a guy that can get his shot any time he wants it."
It was announced by the Rainmen that they had re-signed All-Star Canadian guard Joey Haywood. The Rainmen also released fan favorite Eric Crookshank and traded Taliek Brown to Quebec Kebs for a future first round pick.
The Rainmen announced the trading of their 2012 first-round draft pick Anthony Johnson to the Laval Kebs in return for All-Star guard Eddie Smith. They have also signed point guard Darren Duncan, forward Hillary Haley, guard Joel Smith and Halifax native and St. Francis Xavier University ("St. FX") alumnus Tyler Richards. Each player had attended Halifax's pre-season camp.
2012–13 season.
The Rainmen began their pre-season on Sunday, October 21 versus the Summerside Storm at the Halifax Metro Centre. On November 13, 2012, the Rainmen ended the contract with head coach Cliff Levingston after a poor start to the season. Colter Simmonds filled in as interim head coach until the next head coach will be announced.
On November 15, 2012, the Rainmen named former Laval Kebs head coach Rob Spon to the same position.
2014–15 season.
The Rainmen had the second-best record in the league and were the Atlantic Division champion. They advanced to the championship round vs the Windsor Express, which was supposed to come down to a decisive Game 7 hosted by Windsor. Unfortunately, before Game 7 could even begin, the two teams brawled, police were summoned and the Rainmen left the Windsor Arena. Despite calls to the owner and team to come back by league officials, Halifax forfeited the game and the championship to the Express. Coach Pep Claros was nominated coach of the year, but also suspended by the league for life following an investigation of the brawl.
Bankruptcy, folding, and replacement NBL Canada team.
Following the 2015 NBL Canada Finals brawl with the Windsor Express, the Rainmen were fined a total of $90,000. While each player that participated in the altercation was forced to pay $5,000 each and serve an indefinite suspension along with the coaching staff, a $20,000 fine was also imposed on the organization itself due to "conduct detrimental to the league." Over two months later, the team filed for bankruptcy and was nearly $700,000 in debt, ultimately folding. Owner Andre Levingston said, "While it's disappointing to see this chapter end, I can hold my head high knowing that we did everything we could have done. I love this game and I love this city." The market, however, would not be left without a team as the Halifax Hurricanes, with a larger ownership group of local businessmen including Levingston (who joined the Hurricanes as its general manager), replaced the Rainmen in the market beginning with the 2015–16 NBL Canada season.
Home arena.
The Scotiabank Centre multi-purpose indoor sporting arena located, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The arena has a capacity of 11,093. The Rainmen share the arena with the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.
The building is next to the 
Former World Trade and Convention Centre, at the foot of Citadel Hill and it is the largest arena in Halifax.

Osmundastrum

Osmundastrum is genus of leptosporangiate ferns in the family Osmundaceae with one living species, Osmundastrum cinnamomeum, the cinnamon fern. It is native to the Americas and eastern Asia, growing in swamps, bogs and moist woodlands.
In North America it occurs from southern Labrador west to Ontario, and south through the eastern United States to eastern Mexico and the West Indies; in South America it occurs west to Peru and south to Paraguay. In Asia it occurs from southeastern Siberia south through Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan to India, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. "Osmundastrum cinnamomeum" has a fossil record extending into the Late Cretaceous of North America, approximately 70 million years ago, making it one of the oldest living plant species. The fossil records of the genus extend into the Triassic.
Characteristics.
"Osmundastrum cinnamomeum" is a deciduous herbaceous plant that produces separate fertile and sterile fronds. The sterile fronds are spreading, tall and broad, pinnate, with pinnae long and broad, deeply lobed (so the fronds are nearly, but not quite, bipinnate). The fertile spore-bearing fronds are erect and shorter, tall; they become cinnamon-colored, which gives the species its name. The fertile leaves appear first; their green color slowly becomes brown as the season progresses and the spores are dropped. The spore-bearing stems persist after the sterile fronds are killed by frost, until the next season. The spores must develop within a few weeks or fail.
The "Osmundastrum cinnamomeum" fern forms huge clonal colonies in swampy areas. These ferns form massive rootstocks with densely matted, wiry roots. This root mass is an excellent substrate for many epiphytal plants. They are often harvested as osmunda fiber and used horticulturally, especially in propagating and growing orchids. Cinnamon Ferns do not actually produce cinnamon; they are named for the color of the fertile fronds.
Classification.
Traditionally, this plant has been classified as "Osmunda cinnamomea" L. However, recent genetic and morphological evidence (Metzgar et al. 2008; Jud et al. 2008) clearly demonstrate that the cinnamon fern is a sister species to the entire rest of the living Osmundaceae. Cladistically, it is either necessary then to include all species of the Osmundaceae, including "Todea" and "Leptopteris" in the genus "Osmunda", or else it is necessary to segregate the genus "Osmundastrum". "O. cinnamomeum" is the sole living species in the genus, although it is possible that some additional fossils should be assigned to "Osmundastrum".
Formerly, some authors included the interrupted fern, "Osmunda claytoniana", in the genus or section "Osmundastrum", because of its gross apparent morphological similarities. However, detailed morphology and genetic analysis have proven that the interrupted fern is actually a true "Osmunda". This is borne out by the fact that it is known to hybridize with the American royal fern, "Osmunda spectabilis" to produce "Osmunda × ruggii" in a family in which hybrids are rare, while "Osmundastrum cinnamomeum" has no known hybrids.
"Osmundastrum cinnamomeum" is considered a living fossil because it has been identified in the geologic record as far back as 75 million years ago. The oldest member of the genus is "O. indentatum" from the Triassic of Tasmania, Australia.
The Asian and American populations of cinnamon fern are generally considered to be varieties of a single species, but some botanists classify them as separate species. The Asian taxon is thus named "Osmundastrum asiaticum".
Uses.
According to the Native American Ethnobotany Database, cinnamon fern has been historically used by first nations tribes (Abnaki, Menominee) as a food source. The Iroquois and Cherokee tribes used the fern for a wide variety of medicinal purposes including as a cold remedy, gynecological aid, venereal aid, and as a remedy to snake bites.

Vision Creation Newsun

Vision Creation Newsun is an album by Japanese rock band Boredoms released by WEA Japan. The standard one-disc edition was released in Japan December 10, 1999, and in the United States the following year by Birdman Records.
Music and composition.
Described as a space rock and krautrock album, "Vision Creation Newsun" marks the band moving away from their noise-influenced sound. According to AllMusic's Mark Richardson, the album sees Boredoms "settling into a loose, jam-oriented aesthetic." Richardson further added: "The first two tracks find Boredoms further investigating pounding tribal rock with propulsive drumming, energetic guitar work, and vocal chants. The overall feel bears some similarity to "Super æ", with tracks that draw from Krautrock and psychedelia, but "Vision Creation Newsun" adds a folk element, including softer instrumental textures like hand percussion, lengthy cymbal washes, and acoustic guitars. Some passages even flirt with new age, as they weave bird songs and the sound of falling water into the mix."
Critical reception.
"Vision Creation Newsun" generally received positive reviews from music critics. Writing for AllMusic, Mark Richardson said: "This is not the left-field triumph that "Super æ" was, but it's a strong album nonetheless."
"Pitchfork" ranked "Vision Creation Newsun" at number 39 on its list of the 200 best albums of the 2000s.
Track listing.
With the exception of track #9, each song's title is represented officially by a symbol. When referring to these tracks in print and in MP3 tags, the alternate names (including parentheses) are often used.
Limited edition.
The album was originally released with alternative artwork, a second disc, a T-shirt, a sticker, and an electronic device that played sampled frog noises when the box was opened. The second disc contains a 30+ minute live track consisting of an unreleased song and the opening track from the studio disc. The track is bookended by two short edits of tracks from the studio disc.

Richard of San Germano

Richard of San Germano (; before 1170 – after October 1243) was a notary in San Germano in the Latin Valley not far from the monastery of Monte Cassino between February 1186 and March 1232. He wrote a chronicle (sometimes "Chronica regni Siciliae") of the Mezzogiorno from the death of William II of Sicily in 1189 to 1243. It is the fullest source of information on the Hohenstaufen in Italy. 
Richard was a companion of Stephen of Marsia, the abbot of Montecassino, and dedicated his chronicle to him. His brother John was also a notary, though in the chancery of Emperor Frederick II. In the early 1220s, Richard was found in the service of Frederick, perhaps alongside his brother. In the late 1230s, Richard became an imperial Chamberlain (until 1242). 
His chronicle was originally intended as a continuation of the "Annales Casinenses". It is largely, but far from mostly, focused on the "Terra Sancti Benedicti", the lands of the abbey of Montecassino. The first part was written beginning in 1216 and covers the time between the papal visit to San Germano and the death of Stephen of Marsia in July 1227. This survives in manuscript form in Bologna. Altered and expanded to stand on its own, the chronicle was finished after the Roman visit of Pope Innocent IV in October 1243. It then began with the conquest of Sicily by Henry VI. It is an important source for the War of the Keys (1228–1230).
Richard was personally involved in many of the events he recounts. Pope Innocent III visited his monastery in June 1208. He accompanied Stephen of Marsia to the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. He was at the siege of Milan in 1239.

Terra Sancti Benedicti

The Terra Sancti Benedicti ("Land of Saint Benedict") was the secular territory, or seignory, of the powerful Abbey of Montecassino, the chief monastery of the Mezzogiorno and one of the first Western monasteries: founded by Benedict of Nursia himself, hence the name of its possessions. It lasted from the 8th to the 19th century.
The "Terra Sancti Benedicti" was part of larger states, according to the historical succession, from the Duchy of Benevento to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Despite the wide autonomy it enjoyed in some periods, it was never, neither de jure nor de facto, an independent state, as were the Italian city-states of Northern and Central Italy. The nature of the dominion of the Abbey of Montecassino has sometimes been improperly assimilated to these Italian states. The "Terra Sancti Benedicti" is therefore an integral part of the Terra di Lavoro and has always followed its political vicissitudes.
History.
The foundation of the Terra Sancti Benedicti can be traced back to the large donation of land made in 744 to the monastery by the Gisulf II of Benevento. The donation was probably of both a religious and political nature: thus an alliance between the Church and the Duchy of Benevento was guaranteed to defend each other. In the following centuries, monasteries, churches and castles with annexed possessions were gradually offered to the monastery, even overseas, through concessions and donations made by nobles, emperors and popes, reaching eighty thousand hectares.
The history of the territories linked to the Benedictine Abbey can be divided into three main phases which correspond to three different approaches to the control of the territory: first the age of the Manorialism, then that of the ""castrum" and finally that of the development of the "universitas civium"". Subsequently, the Abbey progressively loses its historical temporal power.
After these phases of development, the loss of power by Montecassino and the fading of the territory it had controlled into larger organisms began with alternating events. An earthquake destroyed the Abbey in 1349 and, although it soon returned to its function, the event can be considered an important watershed. In the 14th century, the Papal States tried to limit the abbey ecclesiastical jurisdiction placing a bishop at San Germano, but the abbots managed to maintain many prerogatives thanks to Pope Urban V.
The official end of the feudal lordship came in 1806 with the abolition of feudal rights in the Kingdom of Naples sanctioned by the so-called "laws of subversion of feudality".
With the loss of temporal power, the jurisdiction of the abbey over the surrounding territory remained only ecclesiastical, as a territorial abbey: the abbots were equated in their functions with diocesan bishops, even if in most cases they were not awarded the episcopal character.

Kirkwood approximation

The Kirkwood superposition approximation was introduced in 1935 by John G. Kirkwood as a means of representing a discrete probability distribution. The Kirkwood approximation for a discrete probability density function formula_1 is given by
where
is the product of probabilities over all subsets of variables of size "i" in variable set formula_4. This kind of formula has been considered by Watanabe (1960) and, according to Watanabe, also by Robert Fano. For the three-variable case, it reduces to simply
The Kirkwood approximation does not generally produce a valid probability distribution (the normalization condition is violated). Watanabe claims that for this reason informational expressions of this type are not meaningful, and indeed there has been very little written about the properties of this measure. The Kirkwood approximation is the probabilistic counterpart of the interaction information.
Judea Pearl (1988 §3.2.4) indicates that an expression of this type can be exact in the case of a "decomposable" model, that is, a probability distribution that admits a graph structure whose cliques form a tree. In such cases, the numerator contains the product of the intra-clique joint distributions and the denominator contains the product of the clique intersection distributions.

The Princess Who Never Smiled

The Princess Who Never Smiled, The Unsmiling Tsarevna or The Tsarevna who Would not Laugh (, Tsarevna Nesmeyana) is a Russian folk fairy tale collected by Alexander Afanasyev in "Narodnye russkie skazki", as tale number 297.
Synopsis.
The story takes place in a kingdom where a princess has never smiled. Her father, the king, declares that anyone who can make her smile can marry her. Suitors make their attempts but none succeed.
Meanwhile, a humble worker in the same kingdom is told by his master that he can take as many coins as he wants for his annual labors. The worker in all his humility takes just one coin, which he proceeds to lose down a well. He does the same the next year. Then in the third year, as he goes to drink from the same well, he not only retains his coin, but finds the two coins he lost before.
With his new-found coins the worker decides to travel the world. But before he can leave the country—in his continued humility—he gives one of the coins to a mouse, one to a beetle, and one to a catfish.
Again coin-less, the worker passes by the king's castle, where he proceeds to slip and fall in mud. The mouse, beetle, and catfish, witnessing this and recalling his kindness to them, come to his aid. The princess, looking on, smiles at the scene before her, and the worker, entering the castle and transforming into a handsome man, marries the princess and they live happily ever after.
Translations.
The tale was translated as "The Princess Who Never Smiled".
Analysis.
Tale type.
The Russian tale is classified - and gives its name - to the East Slavic type SUS 559, , of the East Slavic Folktale Classification (). The East Slavic type corresponds to tale type ATU 559, "Making the Princess Laugh (The Dungbeetle)", of the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index. In this tale type, the poor boy wins the hand of the princess through a bizarre presentation of small creatures and bugs that makes her laugh.
Scholar Stith Thompson explained that the name of the tale type is due to the presence of the dung beetle "in nearly all versions of the narrative".
Motifs.
Making the princess laugh, or smile, is a common fairy tale motif of various uses. The culmination of Golden Goose and The Magic Swan (both classified as ATU 571, "All Stick Together"), where the goose or swan causes other characters to adhere to one another, is that the sight causes a princess to laugh for the first time. This ultimately leads to the princess’s marriage in each story. Peruonto and the frame story of Giambattista Basile, however, depict stories where someone who has been laughed at casts a curse on the princess to force her to marry someone.
Before the edition of Antti Aarne's first folktale classification, Svend Grundtvig developed - and later Astrid Lunding translated - a classification system for Danish folktales in comparison with other international compilations available at the time. In this preliminary system, two folktypes were grouped together based on "essential characteristics": folktypes 20A "Hold fast!" ("Stick to! [The Golden Goose]") and 20B "Skellebasserne" ("The Scarabees"). Both tales were grouped under the banner "The Princess who can not help laughing".
Variants.
An early literary version of the tale type was published in "Pentamerone", with the title "Lo scarafone, lo sorece e lo grillo" ("The Scarab, the Mouse and the Cricket").
In an "Irish fairy tale" compiled by authors Ada M. Skinner and Eleanor L. Skinner, "How Timothy Won the Princess", a poor widow sends her son Timothy to sell her three white cows to put food on the table. However, the boy becomes delighted by the performance of a dwarf man, who produces a tiny mouse, a cockroach and a bee - all dressed in fine clothes - to play and dance for the crowd. Fascinated by the little creatures, he trades the cows for them and takes them home. His mother looks disappointed in him, even after he shows her the strange little animals. Some time later, the boy uses the little musicians to make the princess laugh and ends up marrying her.
Retellings.
A Sesame Street Book Club book entitled "The Sesame Street Alphabet Storybook" (which interspersed different objects starting with subsequent letters into infamous stories as told by Sesame Street characters) included a quick telling of "The Princess who Never Laughed" using a xylophone and yo-yo's (X and Y) as props used by two people trying to make the princess laugh to no avail. It comes to end when Cookie Monster, who was lurking behind them, ate both items, which the princess did think was funny.
A 1978 episode of Yeralash retells the story by having a king order his prime minister to make his daughter laugh. A number of real-life comedians are summoned, including Gennady Khazanov and Oleg Popov, but all fail. Then the minister brings forth a young boy to sit at the royal table, and his complete lack of manners does make everyone laugh, including the princess.

Saagar (album)

Saagar (; ; ) is the debut album by the Pakistani pop rock band, Fuzön, released in January, 2002 by Amazing Productions/Empire Music Limited in Pakistan and by Virgin Records in India. The album is also known eponymously as "Fuzön" and was re-released in 2004 by the Sound Master record label. "Saagar" is noteworthy for embedding elements of Hindustani classical "ragas" within pop rock and jazz compositions, and it is widely considered a pathbreaking album for the way it revolutionized Pakistani music in the 2000s. The album also made history by becoming the first album to be released by a band simultaneously in both India and Pakistan.
Overview.
Recorded at Planet Audio Studios and mixed and mastered in Sound Master Studios (both in Karachi, Pakistan), "Saagar" was among the first albums in Pakistan to be produced entirely using digital recording equipment at a time when the analog format was still the norm. The overall reaction to "Saagar" was generally positive and it was both commercially successful and critically well received. All three founding members of Fuzön — producer and keyboardist Imran (Emu) Momina, guitarist Shallum Asher Xavier, and lead vocalist Shafqat Amanat Ali — were propelled into fame across the subcontinent as a result of the unprecedented success of "Saagar".
The lead single of the album, "Aankhon Ke Saagar" as well as the songs "Khamaj" (also known as "Mora Saiyaan") and "Akhian" received significant airtime on music channels and FM radio stations in both India and Pakistan. The tracks "Khamaj (Mora Saiyaan)" and "Teray Bina" were also featured in the soundtrack of Nagesh Kukunoor's 2004 film, "Hyderabad Blues 2". Lead vocalist Shafqat Amanat Ali has delivered live performances of several tracks from the album — with variations in arrangement — including "Khamaj (Mora Saiyaan)," "Aankhon Ke Saagar," and "Akhiyan" for Coke Studio Pakistan, Coke Studio India, and MTV Unplugged India.
Composition and songwriting.
The album is notable for its unique soundscape that showcases influences of Persian, Arabic, and Indian music, as well as western pop rock. The songs in the album feature a common strain where aspects of Hindustani classical "ragas" are woven into pop melodies, combined with traditional Pakistani folk vocals and the Sufi rock style of singing. Discussing Fuzön's approach to composing the tracks for "Saagar", Ali shared: "It wasn’t like I was trying to be a rebel; breaking convention. I was only taking a fresh route to the ragas to place them in a global soundscape. After all, classical elements lend soul to a composition. Music derives its meditative quality from them." The overall tone of the album is pensive and meditative, with varying notes of rock and jazz.
"Aankhon Ke Saagar" was the first song to be composed and recorded for the album and went on to become immensely popular in India and Pakistan, including becoming the number one song in Pakistan. Recalling how the song came about, Shallum Asher Xavier narrates that he and Shafqat were at Momina's recording studio and were feeling bored. He started strumming a melody on his guitar that he had been developing for a while and Shafqat starting humming along spontaneously. Shafqat recalls, "I really liked the melody, so I started writing some dummy lyrics [and] wrote the lines "'aankhon kay saagar, honton kay saaghar"' then and there, and by the end of the jamming session, we had a rough picture of the song in mind." The song is based on raga Aiman, also known as Yaman.
"Khamaj (Mora Saiyaan)" is a reimagined rendition of a traditional "thumri" from the Patiala gharana tradition of music. Lead vocalist Shafqat Amanat Ali stated in an interview: "with "Mora Saiyaan"...set in raag Khamaj, I introduced the contemporary audience to a "thumri" (evocative love poetry) that my elders had been singing for generations." Seven out of the 12 songs in "Saagar" incorporate elements from Hindustani classical "ragas" and some of them — "Khamaj," "Madhbanti," and "Malhaar" — are eponymously named after the "ragas" upon which they are based.
Reception and impact.
"Saagar" achieved significant commercial success and sold a record 500,000 copies in Pakistan, a singular feat for an album at the time. It was also critically acclaimed for its innovative use of classical ragas in pop rock compositions, its "experimentation and collaboration between different soundscapes and musical disciplines," and its "stylistic reinventions."
"Saagar" has been described as "timeless" and "game-changing" and has been lauded for making a "significant contribution to Pakistani music." The album was also praised for being among the first to make fusion music "commercially palatable for a mass audience." Reflecting on the legacy of the album, Rafay Mahmood of "The Express Tribune" (Pakistan) wrote: "For the first time, people witnessed a trained singer from a classical gharana (in this case Patiala) making perfect use of his vocal range to add depth to rock and roll riffs in arrangements. "Aankhon Ke Saagar" by the trio of Immu, Shallum, and Shafqat took the industry by storm as it was something truly unimaginable, especially at that time. This was a mainstream rock band finding a following across age brackets in every household." Referring to the track, "Akhian," Mahmood wrote: "Featuring Shafqat Amanat Ali, one of the most impeccable vocalists of the subcontinent, along with Imran Momina, and Shallum Xavier, "Akhian" changed the landscape of the music industry in the early 2000s." "The Express Tribune" (Pakistan) wrote, "songs like “Khamaj” and “Teray Bina”...are rendered timeless and will be written in golden words in the history of Pakistani pop." In 2022, "The Telegraph" (India) described the song "Khamaj" as a "timelessly soothing classic."
Awards.
"Saagar" went on to win multiple awards. In 2003, it won Best Emerging Talent at the Lux Style Awards, and Best Composer Award and Best Ballad Award at the Indus Music Awards. In 2004, the music video of "Khamaj (Mora Saiyaan)," directed by Saqib Malik, starring Pakistani actor Shaan Shahid, won the Best Video Award at the Lux Style Awards. The video was inspired by Guru Dutt's romantic drama film "Kaagaz Ke Phool", and it was the most expensive music video made in Pakistan at the time.
Track listing.
All music is written, arranged, and composed by Fuzön. "Piyar Na Raha" is written by John Mall and supplemental lyrics for "Dooriyan" are written by Muhammad Nasir.

Why Do Fools Fall in Love (album)

Why Do Fools Fall in Love is the twelfth studio album by American R&amp;B singer Diana Ross, released on September 14, 1981, by RCA Records. It was Ross' first of six albums released by the label during the decade. It peaked at No. 15 in the United States (No. 4 R&amp;B), No. 17 in the United Kingdom and the top ten in Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands.
Background.
"Why Do Fools Fall in Love" was the first album Ross recorded after leaving the Motown label, when she signed a $20 million deal with RCA. Originally, Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards were slated to produce the follow-up to the platinum "Diana" (1980) album. However, their schedules were filled with commitments to also produce Debbie Harry's solo debut album "KooKoo" (1981), Johnny Mathis and another Chic album. Ross had given her word to RCA president Robert Summers to deliver an album for the 1981 holiday selling season.
The album was the first to be produced by Ross herself, and it became her second RIAA-certified platinum album. It was also certified gold in Canada and the UK.
After Ross returned "Why Do Fools Fall in Love" to the Top Ten in 1981, a major controversy concerning Frankie Lymon's estate ensued. Three women each were involved in lawsuits and counter-lawsuits over Lymon's copyrights and royalties, claiming to be Lymon's rightful widow. The string of court cases led to the making of the 1998 film "Why Do Fools Fall in Love".
Ross embarked on a world tour in support of the album.
The album was remastered and re-released on September 2, 2014, by Funky Town Grooves, with bonus material.
Singles.
The album includes the US top 10 hits "Why Do Fools Fall in Love" - a cover of the 1950s Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers classic - and the rock-flavoured "Mirror Mirror".
It also includes "Work That Body", co-written by Ross with Paul Jabara and Ray Chew which was a top 10 hit in the UK and top 15 in the Netherlands. "It's Never Too Late" was also released as a single in some international territories.
Also included on the album is a solo version of "Endless Love", which was a number one duet with Lionel Richie from earlier that year, as well as a version of another 1950s rock &amp; roll classic, "Sweet Nothings" originally recorded by Brenda Lee.

Battle of Grand Port

The Battle of Grand Port was a naval battle fought on 20–27 August 1810 between squadrons of frigates from the French Navy and the British Royal Navy over possession of the harbour of Grand Port on Isle de France (now Mauritius), as part of the Mauritius campaign during the Napoleonic Wars. A British squadron of four frigates sought to blockade the port to prevent its use by the French through the capture of the fortified Île de la Passe at its entrance. This position was seized by a British landing party on 13 August and, when a French squadron under Captain Guy-Victor Duperré approached the bay nine days later, the British commander, Captain Samuel Pym, decided to lure them into coastal waters where his forces could ambush them.
Four of the five French ships managed to break past the British blockade, taking shelter in the protected anchorage, which was only accessible through a series of complicated routes between reefs and sandbanks that were impassable without an experienced harbour pilot. When Pym ordered his frigates to attack the anchored French on 22 and 23 August, his ships became trapped in the narrow channels of the bay: two were irretrievably grounded; a third, outnumbered by the combined French squadron, was defeated; and a fourth was unable to close to within effective gun range. Although the French ships were also badly damaged, the battle was a disaster for the British: one ship was captured after suffering irreparable damage, the grounded ships were set on fire to prevent their capture by French boarding parties, and the remaining vessel was seized as it left the harbour by the main French squadron from Port Napoleon under Commodore Jacques Hamelin.
The British defeat is often considered the worst suffered by the Royal Navy during all of the Napoleonic Wars. It left the Indian Ocean and its vital trade convoys exposed to attack from Hamelin's frigates. In response, British authorities sought to reinforce the squadron on Isle Bourbon under Commodore Josias Rowley by ordering all available ships to the region, but this piecemeal reinforcement resulted in a series of desperate actions as individual British ships were attacked by the confident and more powerful French squadron. In December an adequate reinforcement was assembled with the provision of a strong battle squadron under Admiral Albemarle Bertie, which rapidly invaded and captured Isle de France.
Background.
During the early 19th century, the Indian Ocean formed an essential part of the network of trade routes that connected the British Empire. Heavily laden East Indiamen travelled from ports in British India such as Bombay and Calcutta to the United Kingdom carrying millions of pounds of goods. From Britain, the ships returned on the same routes, often carrying soldiers for the growing British Indian Army, then under the control of the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). Following the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, the British Admiralty had made the security of these routes a priority, and by 1807, the Dutch bases at the Cape of Good Hope and Java had been neutralised by expeditionary forces to prevent their use by enemy raiders. The French Indian Ocean possessions, principally Isle Bonaparte and Isle de France, were more complicated targets, protected from attack not only by the great distances involved in preparing an invasion attempt but also by heavy fortifications and a substantial garrison of French Army soldiers augmented by large local militias.
The French had recognised the importance of these islands as bases for raiding warships during the French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1801), but by late 1807 the only naval resources allocated to the region were a few older frigates and a large number of local privateers. Following the reduction of these remaining naval forces on Isle de France by defeat in battle and disarmaments due to age and unseaworthiness during 1808, French naval authorities made a serious attempt to disrupt British trade in the region, ordering five large modern frigates to sail to Isle de France under Commodore Jacques Félix Emmanuel Hamelin. Four of these ships broke through the British blockade of the French coast, arriving in the Indian Ocean in the spring of 1809, where Hamelin dispersed them into the Bay of Bengal with orders to intercept, attack, and capture or destroy the heavily armed but extremely valuable convoys of East Indiamen. The first French success came at the end of the spring, when the frigate "Caroline" successfully attacked a convoy in the action of 31 May 1809, seizing two heavily laden merchant ships.
Commodore Josias Rowley was given command of the British response, a hastily assembled force composed mainly of those ships which happened to be available at the Cape of Good Hope in early 1809. Ordered to stop the French raiders, Rowley was unable to spread his small squadron wide enough to pursue the roving French frigates, instead using his forces to blockade and raid the French islands in anticipation of Hamelin's return. In August, "Caroline" arrived with her prizes at Saint-Paul on Isle Bonaparte and Rowley determined to seize the frigate. He planned a successful invasion of the town, launched on 20 September, which resulted in the capture of the port's defences, "Caroline", and the captured East Indiamen. With his objectives complete, Rowley withdrew five days later. Almost a year later, Rowley returned with a larger task force and made a second landing around the capital of Isle Bonaparte, Saint-Denis. Marching on the seat of government, Rowley's troops rapidly overwhelmed the defences and forced the island's garrison to surrender, renaming the island Isle Bourbon and installing a British governor.
Hamelin had used the British preoccupation with Isle Bonaparte to send additional frigates to sea during 1809 and early 1810, including his flagship "Vénus", which captured three East Indiamen in the action of 18 November 1809, and "Bellone", which took the Portuguese frigate "Minerva" in the Bay of Bengal a few days later. "Minerva", renamed "Minerve" in French hands, was subsequently involved in the action of 3 July 1810, when a further two East Indiamen were captured. The squadron in this action was commanded by Guy-Victor Duperré in "Bellone", whose ships were so badly damaged that Duperré was forced to spend nearly a month repairing his vessels in the Comoros Islands before they were ready to return to Isle de France.
Operations off Grand Port.
With Isle Bourbon secured in July 1810, the British now occupied a large fortified island base within easy sailing distance of Isle de France. Even before Isle Bourbon was completely in British hands, Rowley had detached HMS "Sirius" from the invasion squadron with orders to restore the blockade of Isle de France. Shortly afterwards, Captain Samuel Pym of HMS "Sirius" led his men in a raid on a coastal vessel moored off the southern side of the island. Two days after this successful operation, British reinforcements arrived in the form of the frigates HMS "Iphigenia" and HMS "Nereide", and the small brig HMS "Staunch". "Nereide" carried 100 specially selected infantrymen from the 69th and 33rd Regiments and some artillerymen from the garrison at Madras to be used in storming and garrisoning offshore islands, beginning with Île de la Passe, a heavily fortified islet off the southeastern shore which protected the entrance to the natural harbour of Grand Port. These fortified islands could be used to block entry to the ports of Isle de France and thus trap Hamelin's squadron.
Grand Port was an easily defensible natural harbour because the bay was protected from the open sea by a large coral reef through which a complicated channel meandered, known only to experienced local pilots. Île de la Passe was vitally important in the control of Grand Port because it was equipped with a heavy battery that covered the entrance to the channel, thus controlling the passage to the sheltered inner lagoon. The British planned to use the troops on "Nereide", under her captain Nesbit Willoughby, to storm Île de la Passe and capture the battery. Willoughby would then use a local man serving on his ship named John Johnson (referred to in some texts as "the black pilot"), to steer through the channel and land troops near the town, distributing leaflets promising freedom and prosperity under British rule in an attempt to corrode the morale of the defenders.
The first attack on Île de la Passe was launched on the evening of 10 August, with "Staunch" towing boats carrying over 400 soldiers, Royal Marines, and volunteer sailors to the islet under cover of darkness, guided by "Nereide"'s pilot. During the night the pilot became lost; the boats were scattered in high winds and had not reassembled by dawn. To distract French attention from the drifting boats, Pym directed Captain Henry Lambert in "Iphigenia" to sail conspicuously off Port Napoleon, where the main body of the French squadron, led by Hamelin in "Vénus", was based. Pym joined Lambert later in the day and the frigates subsequently returned to the waters of Grand Port by different routes, confusing French observers from the shore as to British intentions. By 13 August, the boats originally intended for the attack had still not been assembled and Pym decided that he could not risk waiting any longer without the French launching a counterattack. Launching his own boats at 8:00 pm, guided by the pilot and commanded by Pym's second-in-command, Lieutenant Norman, Pym's marines and sailors landed on the island in darkness under heavy fire from the defenders. Norman was killed in the initial exchange of fire, but his deputy, Lieutenant Watling, seized the island by storming the fortifications surrounding the battery. Seven British personnel were killed and 18 wounded in the battle, in which the storming party managed to seize intact French naval code books and took 80 prisoners. Willoughby was furious that Pym had assumed command of the operation without his permission and the officers exchanged angry letters, part of an ongoing disagreement between them that engendered mutual distrust.
With Île de la Passe secure, Pym gave command of the blockade of Grand Port to Willoughby and returned to his station off Port Napoleon with "Iphigenia". Willoughby used his independent position to raid the coastline, landing at Pointe du Diable on 17 August on the northern edge of Grand Port with 170 men and storming the fort there, destroying ten cannon and capturing another. Marching south towards the town of Grand Port itself, Willoughby's men fought off French counterattacks and distributed propaganda pamphlets at the farms and villages they passed. Willoughby re-embarked his troops in the evening but landed again the following day at Grande Rivière to observe the effects of his efforts. Burning a signal station, Willoughby advanced inland, but was checked by the arrival of 800 French reinforcements from Port Napoleon and returned to HMS "Nereide". The brief expedition cost the British two men wounded and one missing, to French casualties of at least ten killed or wounded. Willoughby followed the attack on Grande Rivière with unopposed minor landings on 19 and 20 August.
Duperré's arrival.
Willoughby's raiding was interrupted at 10:00 am on 20 August when five ships were sighted, rapidly approaching from the southeast. These ships were Guy-Victor Duperré's squadron of "Bellone", "Minerve", the corvette "Victor", and prizes "Windham" and "Ceylon" returning from the Comoros Islands. Following a month of repairs on Anjouan, Duperré had sailed for Isle de France without encountering any opposition on his return passage, and was intending to enter Grand Port via the channel protected by Île de la Passe. Duperré was unaware of the British occupation of the island, and Willoughby intended to lure the French squadron into the channel by concealing the British presence off the harbour. Once there, Willoughby hoped to defeat them or damage them so severely that they would be unable to break out unaided, thus isolating Duperré's squadron from Hamelin's force in Port Napoleon and containing the French in separate harbours to prevent them from concentrating against the British blockade squadrons. Willoughby brought "Nereide" close to Île de la Passe to combine their fire and protect his boats, which were carrying 160 men back to "Nereide" from a raid near Grand Port that morning.
Raising a French tricolour over Île de la Passe and on "Nereide", Willoughby transmitted the French code captured on the island: "L'ennemi croise au Coin de Mire" and received an acknowledgement from Duperré. The use of these signals convinced Duperré, over the objections of Captain Pierre Bouvet on "Minerve", that "Néréide" was Surcouf's privateer "Charles", which was expected from France. The French squadron closed with the harbour during the morning, "Victor" entering the channel under Île de la Passe at 1:40 pm. As "Victor" passed "Néréide" and the fort, Willoughby opened fire, Lieutenant Nicolas Morice surrendering the outnumbered corvette after the first volley. Willoughby sent boats to attempt to take possession of "Victor", but they were unable to reach the vessel. Behind the corvette, "Minerve" and "Ceylon" pushed into the channel and signalled Morice to follow them, exchanging fire with the fort. As Morice raised his colours again and followed "Minerve", a large explosion blasted out of Île de la Passe, where the false French flag had ignited on a brazier as it was lowered and set fire to a nearby stack of cartridges, which exploded in the close confines of the fort. Three men were killed and 12 badly burned, six cannon were dismounted and one discharged unexpectedly, killing a British sailor in a boat attempting to board "Victor". With the fort out of action and a significant number of her crew scattered in small boats in the channel, "Néréide" was alone and unable to block French entry to Grand Port.
With Willoughby's ambush plan ruined, the scattered boats sought to rejoin "Néréide", passing directly through the French squadron. Although several boats were in danger of being run down by the French ships and one even bumped alongside "Minerve", all eventually rejoined "Néréide" safely. The opportunity to cause significant damage to the French in the narrow channel had been lost, with "Bellone" joining the squadron in passing through the channel with minimal resistance. In addition to British losses in the explosion at the fort, two men had been killed and one wounded on "Néréide". French losses were more severe: "Minerve" suffered 23 casualties and "Ceylon" eight. With both sides recognising that further action was inevitable, Willoughby sent a boat to "Sirius" requesting additional assistance and Duperré sent a message overland with Lieutenant Morice, requesting support from Hamelin's squadron (Morice fell from his horse during the mission and was severely injured). Command of "Victor" passed to Henri Moisson. In the afternoon, Willoughby used mortars on Île de la Passe to shell the French squadron, forcing Duperré to retreat into the shallow harbour at Grand Port. Willoughby subsequently sent officers into Grand Port on 21 August under a flag of truce, demanding the release of "Victor", which he insisted had surrendered and should thus be handed over to the blockade squadron as a prize. Duperré refused to consider the request. One French ship had failed to enter the channel off Grand Port: the captured East Indiaman "Windham". Early on 21 August, her French commander attempted to shelter in Rivière Noire. "Sirius" spotted the merchant ship under the batteries there and sent two boats into the anchorage, stormed the ship, and brought her out without a single casualty, despite the boarding party having forgotten to take any weapons with them and being only armed with wooden foot-stretchers wielded as clubs.
Battle.
From prisoners captured on "Windham", Pym learned of the nature and situation of Duperré's squadron and sent orders to Port Napoleon with Captain Lucius Curtis in the recently arrived HMS "Magicienne" for "Iphigenia" to join "Sirius" and "Néréide" off Grand Port. "Sirius" and "Néréide" met on the morning of 22 August, Willoughby welcoming Pym with signals describing an "enemy of inferior force". Although Duperré's squadron was technically weaker than the four British frigates combined, Willoughby's signal was misleading, as the French had taken up a strong crescent-shaped battleline in the bay and could cover the mouth of the channel through which the British ships could only pass one at a time. Duperré also anticipated the arrival of reinforcements from Port Napoleon under Governor Charles Decaen at any time and could call on the support of soldiers and gun batteries on shore. In addition, French launches had moved the buoys marking the channel through the coral reef to confuse any British advance.
British attack.
On 22 August, at 2:40 pm, Pym led an attack on Duperré's squadron without waiting for "Iphigenia" and "Magicienne", entering the channel that led to the anchorage at Grand Port. He was followed by "Néréide", but Willoughby had refused to allow Pym to embark the harbour pilot, the only person in the British squadron who knew the passage through the reefs. Without guidance by an experienced pilot, "Sirius" was aground within minutes and could not be brought off until 8:30 am on 23 August. "Néréide" anchored nearby during the night to protect the flagship. At 10:00 am, "Iphigenia" and "Magicienne" arrived and at 2:40 pm, after a conference between the captains as to the best course of action, the force again attempted to negotiate the channel. Although the squadron was now guided by "Néréide"'s pilot, "Sirius" again grounded at 3:00 pm and "Magicienne" 15 minutes later after over-correcting to avoid the reef that "Sirius" had struck. "Néréide" and "Iphigenia" continued the attack, "Iphigenia" engaging "Minerve" and "Ceylon" at close range and "Néréide" attacking "Bellone". Long-range fire from "Magicienne" was also directed at "Victor", which was firing on "Néréide".
Within minutes of the British attack, "Ceylon" surrendered and boats from "Magicienne" sought but failed to take possession of her. The French crew drove the captured East Indiaman on shore, joined shortly afterwards by "Minerve", "Bellone", and later by "Victor", so that by 6:30 pm the entire French force was grounded and all but "Bellone" prevented from firing their main broadsides by beached ships blocking their arc of fire. "Bellone" was ideally positioned to maintain her fire on "Néréide" from her beached position, and at 7:00 pm a cannon shot cut "Néréide"'s stern anchor cable. The British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to "Bellone" and pulling both her broadsides away from the French squadron. Raked by "Bellone" and desperate to return fire, Willoughby had the bow anchor cable cut, bringing a portion of his ship's starboard broadside to bear on "Bellone". At 8:00 pm, Duperré was seriously wounded in the cheek by shrapnel from grapeshot fired by "Néréide"; Ensign Vigoureux concealed his unconscious body under a signal flag and discreetly brought him below decks while Bouvet assumed command of the French squadron on board "Bellone", placing Lieutenant Albin Roussin in charge of "Minerve". Building an improvised bridge between the French ships and the shore, Bouvet increased the men and ammunition reaching "Bellone" and thus significantly increased her rate of fire. He also had the rail removed between the foredeck and the quarterdeck of "Minerve", and had iron hooks nailed to the freeboard below the starboard gangway so as to provide attachment points for additional guns, thus building a continuous second deck on his frigate where he constituted a complete second battery. By 10:00 pm "Néréide" was a wreck, receiving shot from several sides, with most of her guns dismounted and casualties mounting to over 200: the first lieutenant was dying, the second was severely wounded, and Willoughby's left eye had been dislodged from its socket by a wooden splinter. Recognising her battered state, Bouvet then diverted fire from "Néréide" to concentrate on "Magicienne".
Refusing to surrender until all options had been exhausted, Willoughby dispatched boats to "Sirius", asking Pym if he believed it would be practical to send boats to tow "Néréide" out of range. Pym replied that with the boats engaged in attempting to tow "Sirius" and "Magicienne" off the reef it was not possible to deploy them under fire to tow "Néréide". Pym also suggested that Willoughby disembark his men and set fire to his ship in the hope that the flames would spread to the French ships clustered on shore. Willoughby refused this suggestion as it was not practical to disembark the dozens of wounded men aboard "Néréide" in the growing darkness and refused to personally abandon his men when Pym ordered him to transfer to "Sirius". At 11:00 pm, Willoughby ordered a boat to row to "Bellone" and notify the French commander that he had surrendered. Willoughby's boat had been holed by shot and was unable to make the short journey. The message was instead conveyed by French prisoners from "Néréide" who had dived overboard and reached the shore during the night. Recalling the false flags used on 20 August, Bouvet resolved to wait until morning before accepting the surrender.
Attempted withdrawal.
At 1:50 am on 24 August, "Bellone" ceased firing on the shattered "Néréide". During the remaining hours of darkness, Pym continued his efforts to dislodge "Sirius" from the reef and sent orders to Lambert, whose "Iphigenia" had been blocked from firing on the French by "Néréide" and also prevented from pursuing the "Minerve" by a large reef blocking access to the beach. With "Iphigenia" now becalmed in the coastal waters, Pym instructed Lambert to begin warping his ship out of the harbour, using anchors attached to the capstan to drag the ship slowly through the shallow water. "Magicienne", like "Iphigenia", had been stranded out of range of the beached French ships and so had instead directed her fire against a battery erected on shore, which she had destroyed by 2:00 am. When daylight came, it showed a scene of great confusion, with "Sirius" and "Magicienne" grounded in the approaches to the harbour, the French ships "on shore in a heap" in the words of Pym, "Iphigenia" slowly pulling herself away from the French squadron and "Néréide" lying broken and battered under the guns of "Bellone", a Union Flag nailed to her masthead. This flag prompted a fresh burst of cannon fire from Bouvet, and it was not until Willoughby ordered the mizzenmast to be chopped down that the French acknowledged the surrender and ceased firing.
At 7:00 am, Lambert notified Pym that he had cleared the reef separating "Iphigenia" from the French ships and suggested that if Pym sent reinforcements from "Sirius" he might be able to board and capture the entire French squadron. Pym refused permission, insisting that Lambert instead assist him in pulling "Sirius" off the reef. Although Lambert intended to subsequently attack the French alone, Pym forbade him and sent a direct order for Lambert to move out of range of the enemy. At 10:00 am, "Iphigenia" reached "Sirius" and together the ships began firing at French troops ashore, who were endeavouring to raise a gun battery within range of the frigates. "Magicienne", irretrievably stuck on the reef, rapidly flooding, and with her capstan smashed by French shot, now bore the brunt of long-range French fire from both "Bellone" and the shore until Pym ordered Curtis to abandon his ship, transferring his men aboard "Iphigenia". At 7:30 pm, "Magicienne" was set on fire, her magazines exploding at 11:00 pm. On the shoreline, Duperré had been unable to spare any men to take possession of "Néréide" until 3:00 pm. A party under Lieutenant Roussin, second in command on "Victor" and temporarily in command of "Minerve", was sent but had orders to return once the ship had been disarmed: freeing the remaining French prisoners, Roussin spiked the guns to prevent their further use, administered basic medical care, and returned to shore, recounting that over 100 men lay dead or dying aboard the British frigate.
At 4:00 am on 25 August, the newly erected French gun battery opened fire on "Sirius" and "Iphigenia", which returned fire as best they could. Accepting that "Sirius" was beyond repair, Pym removed all her personnel and military supplies, setting fire to the frigate at 9:00 am, shortly after "Iphigenia" had pulled beyond the range of the battery, using a cannon as an anchor after losing hers the previous day. French boats attempted to reach "Sirius" and capture her before she exploded, although they turned back when Pym launched his own boats to contest possession of the wreck. The frigate's remaining munitions exploded at 11:00 am. During the morning, Duperré sent an official boarding party aboard "Néréide", who wet the decks to prevent any risk of fire from the ships burning in the harbour and removed 75 corpses from the frigate.
French response.
When news of the arrival of Duperré's squadron reached Decaen at Port Napoleon, he immediately despatched fast couriers to Grand Port and ordered Hamelin's squadron, consisting of the frigates "Vénus", "Manche", "Astrée", and the brig "Entreprenant", to make ready to sail in support of Duperré. Hamelin departed Port Napoleon at midnight on 21 August, intending to sail northeast and then south, down the island's eastern shore. On 23 August, Hamelin's squadron spotted and captured a British transport ship named "Ranger", sent 24 days earlier from the Cape of Good Hope with 300 tons of food supplies and extensive naval stores for Rowley on Isle Bourbon. On rounding the northern headlands of Isle de France, Hamelin found he could make no progress against the headwinds and reversed direction, passing the western shore of the island and arriving off Grand Port at 1:00 pm on 27 August.
The two extra days Hamelin had spent rounding Isle de France saw activity from the British forces remaining at Grand Port. There had been no strong winds in the bay and "Iphigenia" was forced to resort to slowly warping towards the mouth of the channel in the hope of escaping the approaching French reinforcements. Boats had removed the crews of "Sirius" and "Magicienne" to Île de la Passe, where the fortifications had been strengthened, but supplies were running low and "Magicienne"'s launch was sent to Isle Bourbon to request urgent reinforcement and resupply from Rowley's remaining squadron. On the morning of 27 August, Lambert discovered the brig "Entreprenant" off the harbour mouth and three French sail approaching in the distance. "Iphigenia" was still from Île de Passe at the edge of the lagoon and was low on shot and unable to manoeuvre in the calm weather without anchors. Recognising that resistance under such conditions against an overwhelming force was futile, Lambert negotiated with Hamelin, offering to surrender Île de la Passe if "Iphigenia" and the men on the island were given permission to sail to Isle Bourbon unmolested.
British surrender.
On the morning of 28 August, Lambert received a message from Hamelin, promising to release all the prisoners under conditions of parole within one month if Île de la Passe and "Iphigenia" were both surrendered without resistance. The message also threatened that if Lambert refused, the French would attack and overwhelm the badly outnumbered British force. Recognising that food supplies were low, reinforcements had not arrived and that his ammunition stores were almost empty, Lambert agreed to the terms. Lambert later received a message from Decaen proposing similar terms and notified the French governor that he had surrendered to Hamelin. Decaen was furious that Hamelin had agreed terms without consulting him, but eventually agreed to accept the terms of the surrender as well. The wounded were treated by French doctors at Grand Port and later repatriated, although the remainder of the prisoners were placed in a cramped and unpleasant prison at Port Napoleon from which, despite the terms of the surrender, they were not released until British forces captured the island in December.
Rowley first learned of the operations off Grand Port on 22 August, when "Windham" arrived off Saint Paul. Eager to support Pym's attack, Rowley immediately set sail in his frigate HMS "Boadicea", with the transport "Bombay" following with two companies of the 86th Regiment of Foot to provide a garrison on any territory seized in the operation. The headwinds were strong and it was not until 29 August that Rowley arrived off Grand Port, having been notified of the situation there by "Magicienne"'s launch the previous day. Sighting a cluster of frigates around Île de la Passe, Rowley closed with the island before turning sharply when "Vénus" and "Manche" raised their colours and gave chase. Rowley repeatedly feinted towards the French ships and then pulled away, hoping to draw them away from Grand Port in the hope that "Bombay" might board the now unprotected "Iphigenia" and capture her. "Bombay" was thwarted by the reappearance of "Astrée" and "Entreprenant" and Rowley was chased by "Vénus" and "Manche" back to Saint Denis, anchoring there on 30 August. Rowley attempted a second time to rescue "Iphigenia" from Grand Port the following week, but by the time he returned "Bellone" and "Minerve" had been refloated and the French force was far too strong for Rowley's flagship to attack alone.
Aftermath.
The battle is noted as the most significant defeat for the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. Not only had four frigates been lost with their entire crews, but 105 experienced sailors had been killed and 168 wounded in one of the bloodiest frigate encounters of the war. French losses were also heavy, with Duperré reporting 36 killed and 112 wounded on his squadron and among the soldiers firing from the shore.
The loss of such a large proportion of his force placed Rowley at a significant disadvantage in September, as Hamelin's squadron, bolstered by the newly commissioned "Iphigénie", now substantially outnumbered his own (the ruined "Néréide" was also attached to the French squadron, but the damage suffered was so severe that the ship never sailed again). Withdrawing to Isle de France, Rowley requested that reinforcements be diverted from other duties in the region to replace his lost ships and to break the French blockade of Isle Bourbon, led by Bouvet. These newly arrived British frigates, cruising alone in unfamiliar waters, became targets for Hamelin, who twice forced the surrender of single frigates, only for Rowley to beat his ships away from their prize each time. On the second occasion, Rowley was able to chase and capture Hamelin and his flagship "Vénus", bringing an end to his raiding career and to the activities of his squadron, who remained on Isle de France until they were all captured at the fall of the island in December by an invasion fleet under Vice-Admiral Albemarle Bertie.
In France the action was greeted with celebration, and it became the only naval battle commemorated on the Arc de Triomphe. The British response was despondent, although all four captains were subsequently cleared and praised at their courts-martial inquiring into the loss of their ships. The only criticism was of Willoughby, who was accused of giving a misleading signal in indicating that the French were of inferior force on 22 August. Contemporary historian William James described British reaction to the battle as "that the noble behaviour of her officers and crew threw such a halo of glory around the defeat at Grand Port, that, in public opinion at least, the loss of four frigates was scarcely considered a misfortune." He also notes that "No case of which we are aware more deeply affects the character of the Royal Navy than the defeat it sustained at Grand Port." On 30 December 1899, a monument was erected at the harbour of Grand Port in the memory of the British and French sailors who were killed in the engagement.
In literature.
The battle attracted the attention of authors from both Britain and France, featuring in the 1843 novel "Georges" by Alexandre Dumas, "Dead Reckoning" by C. Northcote Parkinson and the 1977 novel "The Mauritius Command" by Patrick O'Brian.

Vasily Karazin

Vasily Nazarovich Karazin (; ; 30 January 1773 – 4 November 1842) was a Russian Enlightenment figure, intellectual, inventor, scientific publisher, founder of the Ministry of National Education in the Russian Empire, and of the Imperial Kharkov University (now the V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University in Ukraine). He was active in such areas as: political activism, social engagement, education, educational policy, agricultural research, meteorology. Made countless discoveries in organic and inorganic chemistry, was the first one to propose to make a network of weather station spanning the whole country.
Biography.
Karazin was born in village, Kharkov Governorate in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine). The Karazins originated from the noble family of Karadzhi or Karadžić, whose representatives migrated to Russia during the reign of Peter the Great. His father was Nazary Aleksandrovich Karazin, a Russian Imperial Army officer noted for his involvement in Pârvu Cantacuzino's 1769 rebellion in Wallachia. Karazin's mother Varvara belonged to Russian nobility and was of partial Cossack starshyna ancestry. Vasily Karazin considered himself to be ethnic Serbian while his paternal family were originally known as Karadžić, which has Serb Montenegrin origins. He was married to from Moscow, who was well known as a translator of French literature into Russian; her stepfather was the Russian Imperial General major . 
Karazin was educated in schools for the nobility in Kharkov and then in Kremenchug. At the age of eighteen, he left for Saint Petersburg, and underwent military training in the 1st Semyonovsky Independent Rifle Regiment. He also studied at the School of Mines, one of the top educational institutions in the Russian Empire at that time. Karazin was unhappy in this environment, and often reacted against the manners and customs condoned by the nobility of the times. Unsatisfied with his military service, he moved back to his village and married a fourteen-year-old serf girl.
In 1798 Karazin attempted to leave Russia given his opposition to the policies of Emperor Paul I, but was denied a passport. After he attempted to cross the border illegally, he was swiftly arrested.
When Alexander I took power, Karazin began petitioning him with his views on government development, pointing out the state's need to invest in education. In 1802 he obtained the tsar's permission to open a university in Kharkov. On 1 September of that year, during a meeting of the Kharkov nobility, he gave a famous speech on the benefits of having a university, asking for voluntary donations. Lacking sufficient funding and academic supplies, Karazin struggled to achieve his educational priorities. The local elite preferred to have a military college in the city.
On 17 January 1805, the Imperial Kharkov University was inaugurated, but Karazin did not take part in the opening ceremony, as by that time he had lost his position with the Ministry of Education. According to Alexander Herzen, "the colossal ideas of Karazin were downscaled to a provincial German "Hochschule"". Forced to return to his village, Karazin established a school for local children. In November 1808, he wrote a letter to the emperor titled "On non-intervention in European affairs" for which he was arrested for a second time.
Karazin carried out a wide range of academic work. He was a member of seven academies and published more than 60 articles in different fields of science, primarily agriculture, pharmacology, chemistry, and physics. As an example of his innovative spirit, in 1810 in his village he opened the first weather station in the territory of present-day Ukraine.
Karazin repeatedly voiced criticism of what he viewed as Alexander's resistance to self-government and national education in the Russian Empire. Karazin was the founding father of the Ministry of National Education. His direct confrontation with Emperor Alexander I was so public, that in 1820–21 Karazin was even imprisoned in Shlisselburg Fortress. After that he lived in his family estate. Karazin died in Nikolaev.
The Russian painter and writer Nikolay Karazin was his grandson.

Citrinitas

Citrinitas, or sometimes xanthosis, is a term given by alchemists to "yellowness." It is one of the four major stages of the alchemical magnum opus. In alchemical philosophy, citrinitas stood for the dawning of the "solar light" inherent in one's being, and that the reflective "lunar or soul light" was no longer necessary. The other three alchemical stages were nigredo (blackness), albedo (whiteness), and rubedo (redness).
Psychologist Carl Jung is credited with interpreting the alchemical process as analogous to modern-day psychoanalysis. In the Jungian archetypal schema, nigredo is the Shadow; albedo refers to the anima and animus (contrasexual soul images); citrinitas is the wise old man (or woman) archetype; and rubedo is the Self archetype which has achieved wholeness.

Mark von Hagen

Mark Louis von Hagen (July 21, 1954 – September 15, 2019) was an American military historian who taught Russian, Ukrainian, and Eurasian history at Arizona State University. He was formerly at Columbia University. He was commissioned by "The New York Times" to write an independent assessment of "Times" correspondent Walter Duranty and his reporting on the Soviet Union after the newspaper received a letter from the Pulitzer Prize Board regarding allegations of Duranty's role in the cover-up of the Holodomor in Soviet Ukraine.
Education and career.
Born in Cincinnati, Ohio to Daniel von Hagen (February 29, 1924 – August 7, 2019), a high school history teacher, and Martha (Kastner) von Hagen (d. 2013), Mark von Hagen and his brother, Luke, were raised in Colorado.
Von Hagen was educated at Georgetown University, Indiana University-Bloomington, and Stanford University, where he received his Ph.D. He has also taught at Stanford University, Yale University, the Free University of Berlin, and the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris). He served as associate director and then Director of the Harriman Institute (1989–2001). In the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia, he chaired the task force on review of the school's curriculum, headed its Inter-regional Council, and served as director of the master's program in international affairs.
He served on the editorial boards of Ab Imperio, and "Kritika". Von Hagen served on several professional association boards (the National Council for Eurasian and East European Studies, the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies, and the Association for the Study of Nationalities, among others). He also was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Human Rights Watch Eurasia Steering Committee. He served as a consultant for the Russian Archives Project of Primary Source Microfilms (Gale Group). From 2002 to 2005, Von Hagen was president of the International Association for Ukrainian Studies.
Hagen served as the Emeritus Professor of history and global studies with a joint appointment in the School of History, Philosophy and Religious Studies and School of International Letters and Cultures in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Arizona State University. He also was the founding director of the Office for Veteran and Military Academic Engagement at Arizona State University.
He wrote "Soldiers in the Proletarian Dictatorship: The Red Army and the Soviet Socialist State, 1917-1930" (Cornell, 1990) and "War in a European Borderland: Occupations and Occupation Plans in Galicia and Ukraine, 1914-1918" (U of Washington Press, 2007); was co-editor (with Andreas Kappeler, Zenon Kohut and Frank Sysyn) of "Culture, Nation, Identity: the Ukrainian-Russian Encounter, 1600-1945" (Toronto, 2003); and co-edited (with Jane Burbank and Anatoly Remnev) the title "Geographies of Empire: Ruling Russia, 1700-1991" (Indiana, 2004). He wrote articles and essays on topics in historiography, civil-military relations, nationality politics and minority history, and cultural history.
Walter Duranty investigation.
In 2003, "The New York Times" commissioned Von Hagen to study Duranty's role in covering up genocide in Ukraine. He reported that "after reading through a good portion of Duranty's reporting for 1931, I was disappointed and disturbed by the overall picture he painted of the Soviet Union for that period...but after reading so much of Duranty in 1931 it is far less surprising to me that he would deny in print the famine of 1932-1933." The results of the study led him to call for Duranty's Pulitzer Prize to be revoked, remarking to the press that "for the sake of "The New York Times" honor, they should take the prize away."
Asked if his opinion of Duranty's reporting would change if he were to examine only those 13 articles for which Duranty won the Pulitzer Prize, Dr. von Hagen replied with a resolute no. The reporting for which he won the Pulitzer Prize was "quintessential of the problems of Mr. Duranty's analysis," Dr. von Hagen said. The professor said that Duranty's award "diminishes the prize's value."
Personal life.
Von Hagen married Johnny Roldan-Chacon on October 15, 2013 in California. He died in 2019 after an extended illness.

Nobody Knows (Pink song)

"Nobody Knows" is a song by American singer-songwriter Pink, released as the fourth single from her fourth album, "I'm Not Dead" (2006). It was released on November 20, 2006, in Britain and during January 2007 in Australia and Germany.
Composition and critical reception.
"Nobody Knows" was written by Pink and co-written and produced by Billy Mann. The song is a piano-ballad and deals with her feelings of depression. The song received positive reviews. IGN's wrote that "'Nobody Knows' goes for a shiny blues ballad feel, Pink flexing her vocal chords to reveal a downright sweetness to her voice." Quentin Huff from PopMatters wrote an extensive review about the song, stating that "Even when you feel like you’ve heard it before, her smoky vocals and clever touches let you know it’s not the same old thing." While commenting about her voice, he said that she "belts out her lyrics like a champ." Entertainment Weekly's Chris Willman wrote that the song can be skipped while listening to the album, while referring the track as a "stab at Xtina-style balladic solipsism, Pink's vocal span from G3 to G5"
Commercial release.
The song was released as a single on November 20, 2006, in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and on January 13, 2007, in Australia; it reached number 27 in all three countries. It was the only physical single from "I'm Not Dead" to miss the top five on the ARIA Singles Chart, on which it reached its peak in late January 2007, but it was very popular on radio. Two weeks before this, "Who Knew" (the second "I'm Not Dead" single) had re-entered the chart and "U + Ur Hand" was still on the chart, which meant that three singles by Pink were in the top fifty (as of January 21, 2007). On the UK Singles Chart it was Pink's lowest peaking single at the time, and the first "I'm Not Dead" single to miss the top ten.
"Nobody Knows" reached number 17 in Germany and number 74 on the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles chart. Although it reached the top 40 on the majority of charts on which it appeared, it was not as successful as the album's preceding singles. In Canada the song was released to radio in mid-January shortly after the success of "U + Ur Hand"; in Belgium "Dear Mr. President" was the fourth single from the album.
Music video.
The music video was shot in London by director Jake Nava. The first scene features Pink in a hotel room (shot in The May Fair hotel) staring out of a window to London at night, that changes to sunrise. She then watches TV but finds there's hardly anything on apart from a melting snowman and puts her head under her pillow before accessing her laptop computer. During the video she messes up the room by throwing everything around, and she is later seen sitting in the fetal position in a shower. Another scene shows Pink walking down a street, past a couple in love and some drunken men. The video ends with Pink singing to an empty auditorium, pretending to do a real performance.
Use in singing competitions.
The song enjoys great popularity within contestants of TV singing competitions. The song was used in 2007 by Natalie Gauci as her Top 3 performance during Australian Idol's Season 5. The song was sung in 2009 by Rachel Adedeji sixth series of "The X Factor". It was covered in week 3 of the seventh series of "The X Factor" by the boyband One Direction in 2010. In 2011, LeRoy Bell of "The X Factor USA"'s first season covered the song during Top 17 Performance. It was also covered by Jade Richards as well as Amelia Lily Oliver for Bootcamp Stage 2 during eight series of "The X Factor UK." Most recently, it was covered by Jessica Espinoza during her audition for the second season of "The X Factor USA".

Confederate Memorial State Historic Site

The Confederate Memorial State Historic Site is a state-owned property occupying approximately near Higginsville, Missouri. From 1891 to 1950, the site was used as an old soldiers' home for veterans of the Confederate States Army after the American Civil War. The Missouri state government then took over operation of the site after the last veteran died in 1950, using it as a state park. In 1981, a cottage, a chapel, and the Confederate cemetery were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Confederate Chapel, Cemetery and Cottage. The chapel was moved from its original position in 1913, but was returned in 1978. It has a tower and a stained glass window. The cottage is a small wooden building, and the cemetery contains 723 graves. Within the cemetery is a monument erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy which is modeled on the "Lion of Lucerne". In addition to the cemetery and historic structures, the grounds also contain trails, picnic sites, and fishing ponds.
History.
After the end of the American Civil War in Missouri, veterans of the Confederate States Army faced hard times. Confederate veterans, some of whom had difficulty accessing medical treatment and who had been disenfranchised from voting, met throughout the state periodically after the war. At one such meeting in Higginsville in 1889, the idea of creating an old soldiers' home to care for aging Confederate veterans was discussed. In 1891, in the Higginsville vicinity were purchased to establish the old soldier's home. The families of Confederate veterans were also allowed to live at the site. By 1897, the group operating the site was running out of funds, and the state government stepped in to help run the site. While the state funded the site, the home's board of trustees was still composed of Confederate veterans. Facilities for producing electricity existed at the site, and about 30 buildings were located on the grounds at its peak.
Over the course of the site's use as an old soldiers' home, about 1,600 people from all but one state of the former Confederacy resided at the site. A chapel located on the park grounds was moved in 1913, as the aging veterans were having difficulty walking to the chapel for religious services; the chapel's basement was also used for the production of hard cider. In 1925, Missouri designated of the home as a memorial to Confederate soldiers. It remained in operation until 1950, when the last Confederate veteran in the state died, after which the state government purchased the site to operate as a state park.
The state's land acquisition process was completed in 1952. In 1954, most of the remaining buildings in the park were torn down. Beginning in 1956, parts of the site were also used for storage by a local school, and the chapel was technically under the administration of the Missouri Department of Mental Health until 1977. On December 16, 1981, the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as "Confederate Chapel, Cemetery and Cottage", with a register number of 81000335. At the time of the register listing, the chapel was assessed to be in good condition, while the cottage was given a lower condition rating of fair. The cottage was still located in its original site, while the chapel had been moved twice: once in 1913 and once in 1978 when it was returned to its original site after a concrete basement had been built there. In the 2000s, a Confederate flag officially flown at the site was removed when the state government declared that only the United States flag and the flag of Missouri could be flown at state parks; the Confederate flag was displayed, not flown, while the site was used as an old soldiers' home. While many Confederate monuments and memorials have been removed in recent years, there has been very little pressure to remove or rename the site. The journalist Seth Boester, writing for the "Columbia Missourian", has speculated that this is because the site's historic usage as a retirement home makes it less controversial.
Features.
The Missouri Department of Natural Resources maintains of land at the site. The site saw a total of 151,026 visitors in 2020. On the park grounds are 10 buildings and of roadways; most of the buildings are located in the northwestern portion of the park. Visitors are allowed to tour the historic chapel, the park cemetery, and three other buildings. Picnic sites, walking trails, and ponds for recreational fishing are also present on the grounds. Only of the park are part of the National Register of Historic Places listing. The park's chapel is not evenly shaped, as one side is long, the side opposite is long, and the other two sides are long. The building is decorated with a tower and a stained glass window and is sided with weatherboard. Weddings can be held within the chapel.
The Confederate cemetery at the park contains 723 graves, some of which are double. Most of the headstones marking the graves are simple, although a few ornate exceptions exist. A monument modeled after the "Lion of Lucerne" is located within the cemetery; it was erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1906 and bears the inscription "In Memoriam  OUR CONFEDERATE DEAD". A plaque on the monument pictures Robert E. Lee, and a religious inscription is engraved below the lion. The cottage is a wood building on a brick foundation; it is roofed with shingles and is generally rectangularly shaped.

Wally Badarou

Waliou Jacques Daniel Isheola "Wally" Badarou (born 22 March 1955) is a French musician. Born in France with ancestry from Benin, West Africa, Badarou is known for his close association with the English group Level 42, and for his prolific work as a session musician with a wide variety of performers from around the world.
Biography.
Badarou was the long-time associate of the British band Level 42, contributing on keyboards, synthesizers and programming. He has co-written and performed on a number of the band's tracks since their recording début in 1980, later co-producing them.
Though never an official member of Level 42, he could be considered a "de facto" "fifth member" of the band's classic line-up from 1980 through 1994, as he played keyboards and synths on all their studio albums, and co-wrote and/or co-produced much of their material. However, Badarou did not play with Level 42 on concert dates, and he has not been involved with the revived version of the group, which reunited in the early 2000s.
Badarou was close to Island Records's founder Chris Blackwell, and was one of the Compass Point All Stars (with Sly and Robbie, Barry Reynolds, Mikey Chung and Uziah "Sticky" Thompson), the in-house recording team of Compass Point Studios responsible for a long series of albums of the 1980s recorded by Grace Jones, Tom Tom Club, Joe Cocker, Mick Jagger, Black Uhuru, Gwen Guthrie, Jimmy Cliff and Gregory Isaacs.
Badarou's keyboard playing could also be heard on albums by Robert Palmer, Marianne Faithfull, Herbie Hancock, M (Pop Muzik), Talking Heads, Tom Tom Club, Foreigner, Power Station, Melissa Etheridge, Manu Dibango, Miriam Makeba, and Lizzy Mercier Descloux.
He produced albums by Fela Kuti, Salif Keita, Wasis Diop, Trilok Gurtu, Carlinhos Brown; wrote for the films "Countryman", and "Kiss of the Spider Woman"; plus directed and wrote for Jean-Paul Goude's French Bicentennial parade, Bastille Day 1989. So integral was his involvement on Lizzy Mercier Descloux's classic second album, Mambo Nassau, that he is tantamount to uncredited co-producer and unacknowledged co-songwriter. 
His solo instrumental work includes two albums: "Echoes" (1984) and "Words of a Mountain" (1989). The former included "Chief Inspector", "Mambo" (sampled for Massive Attack's "Daydreaming" ("Blue Lines" album)), and "Hi-Life". "Chief Inspector" peaked at #46 in the UK Singles Chart in October 1985.
The "Words of a Mountain" album is believed to be one of the first fully tapeless recordings in contemporary/new-age history: co-pioneering the computerised home studio concept with other electronic musicians of his generation, Badarou established a reputation on the field with his extensive use of Sequential Circuits Prophet 5, New England Digital Synclavier, and custom voice-controlled Yamaha digital mixers.
Badarou also helped organise the Kora All Africa Music Awards in 1997, while co-writing and producing "So Why", a charity album for the ICRC, conceived as a call against ethnic cleansing in Africa, featuring Youssou N'Dour and Papa Wemba.
He has embraced stage acting since the early 2000s, showing interest in aviation, movies, science-fiction and philosophy.
By the end of 2009, starting with "Fisherman", a 15-minute long "marathon in afro-beat territory", Badarou releases his albums—including his latest, "The Unnamed Trilogy"—exclusively online, one single at a time via the JukeSticker, a direct and sharable transaction tool: "At very long last, my fans are to receive the music that never stopped haunting me all these years. The whole of it will be available as a physical collector set, once the three albums are fully revealed".
In 2012, he was elected to the board of SACEM, the french collective management organisation for authors rights in music.
In 2014, along with a cast of music luminaries, he founded the African Music Academy (AMA).

Shasta High School

Shasta High School is an American public high school located in Redding, California. With an enrollment of over 1600 students, it is the largest high school in Shasta County, California. It has been recognized as a California Distinguished School three times and has earned a six-year Western Association of Schools and Colleges accreditation. Its main rival is Enterprise High School.
History.
In 1899, Shasta County High School opened as a public school to serve the town of Redding, California. The inaugural class had only 70 students, 3 teachers, and a very small number of graduates. The courses were college preparatory and in addition vocational classes, such as bookkeeping and shorthand, were taught. The initial school was located in the residence of Judge Bell but in 1903, a two-story brick building was built for the 1904–1905 school year. After a countywide election in 1915, Shasta Union High School District was created and the school was renamed Shasta High School.
By 1926, the student enrollment number had grown to over 450, and need for a new campus became clear, as the school building had been built for 250 students. In March, 1926 a location was picked at the corner of Magnolia and Eureka streets. By October 1927, students were able to move into the new school. In 1950, Shasta Junior College was built on land west of the Shasta High School and remained there until a new college was built in east Redding in 1967. Shasta High moved one last time into the vacated Shasta College facilities which is its location today. The old Shasta High Building became Nova High, which housed all 9th graders in the district. After 9th grade, the students moved on to either Shasta High, Central Valley High, or Enterprise High for 10–12.
In 1991, Nova High was closed and 9th graders moved back into Shasta High and the other high schools. The old building would later become Shasta Learning Center, home to the district offices and to University Preparatory School.
Academics.
Shasta High School offers a variety of advanced courses, such as College Prep, Honors, and Advanced Placement.
Shasta High also offers Career/Technical Education courses including a Science/ Technology/ Engineering/ Math pathway (STEM), and a medical pathway including on-campus courses such as Nursing, Sports Medicine, and Dentistry.
They offer foreign languages: French, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese and American Sign Language.
Athletics.
Shasta High School offers the following sports:
In 2014, the cheerleading squad went to Orlando, Florida to compete in the UCA's National High School Cheerleading Championship, where they placed 5th in the large varsity division non-tumbling.
River Bowl.
Shasta High School's main rival is Enterprise High School (Redding, California). The Rivalry of Enterprise High and Shasta High started back in the 1950s, when both schools would steal the other's "prized" possession. For Shasta High School it was the Shasta High Bell. 
The annual football game between the two rivals would later be called the Riverbowl. 
The tradition began in 1993, with Enterprise dominating the first 11 years. In 2004, Shasta won the Riverbowl and again in 2005 and 2007, but lost in 2008. Enterprise won again in 2009.
The 2010 Riverbowl was won by Shasta with a score of 53–20. That year's Varsity kicker was Ellie Oliver, possibly the only girl football player in the north state at that time.
Performing Arts.
Shasta High School's instrumentalist groups and choirs perform and compete several concerts and festivals each year. Since the 1960s they have collaborated on two major events each year: a madrigal dinner and a musical. 
Choir.
Shasta's A Cappella Choir is the mix choir and largest choral group at Shasta. In 2014, they competed in the California Golden State Choral Competition for the first time, where they placed 5th in the large choir division. They competed again in 2015 and won 4th place, and again in 2016 and won 3rd place.
The Madrigal choir, the advanced mixed choir, is most featured during the annual Madrigal Dinner, and is hired to sing at various functions around town throughout the year. In 2016, the Madrigal Choir completed in the small choir division of the Golden State Competition and won 5th place.
Shasta has three other choirs: Troubadors (beginner boys), Nightingales (beginner girls), and Choraliers (advance girls).
Instrumental.
There are five performing instrumental music groups at Shasta: Concert Band, Symphonic Band, Strings, Orchestra, and The Shasta Jazz Ambassadors. The combined concert and symphonic bands perform at each year's graduation ceremony and during home varsity football games. They also perform at the annual Redding Rodeo Parade, and the Lighted Christmas Parade.
Student life.
Clubs.
Shasta High School also offers a variety of clubs for students. It participates in the National Science Bowl and was involved in the local TV game show Academic Challenge until its cancellation in 2005. Shasta's Interact Club and Students joined to create a fundraiser for the Genocide situations in Darfur.

<doc id="6969185" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6969185" title="Touchdown Atlantic">
Touchdown Atlantic

Touchdown Atlantic (French: Touché Atlantique) is a series of neutral site Canadian Football League games played in the Maritime provinces of Canada.
In 2003, the league had struck a committee to examine the feasibility of adding a tenth team, with the leading candidate cities being Quebec City and Halifax. Before the suspension of the Renegades, league commissioner Tom Wright had indicated that Halifax was the leading candidate for expansion. With the success of Touchdown Atlantic 2010, Moncton was also considered for CFL expansion. No Touchdown Atlantic was played from 2014 to 2018, but it returned in 2019 due to the renewed interest in an Atlantic expansion team.
Exhibition games.
Prior to the official Touchdown Atlantic series, Saint John, New Brunswick, hosted a pair of exhibition games. In 1986, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers defeated the Montreal Alouettes 35–10 at Canada Games Stadium before a sellout crowd of 11,463 fans. The following year, the Alouettes returned to the Port City and lost 14–13 to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats; the Alouettes would fold a week later. An exhibition game between the Ottawa Renegades and Montreal was held in Quebec City in 2003 at PEPS Stadium, with the Alouettes winning 54–23 in front of 10,358.
The first game of the Touchdown Atlantic series was an exhibition pre-season match played in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at Huskies Stadium in June 2005. The game, between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, ended in a 16–16 tie. The game was to gauge Halifax's support for a potential CFL expansion team, which would likely be named the Schooners. Temporary seating was added to boost the capacity, and a sellout crowd of 11,148 attended. It was also used by the league to test its instant replay challenge system which was implemented in the 2006 CFL season.
A second game was to be played on June 3, 2006, at Halifax's Huskies Stadium, with temporary seating for a capacity of 11,000 fans. This game was canceled after the suspension of the Ottawa Renegades, who were scheduled to play the Montreal Alouettes.
Regular season games.
In October 2009, it was officially announced that the Edmonton Eskimos would face the Toronto Argonauts in Moncton, New Brunswick, on September 26, 2010, in the first regular season game in Atlantic Canada. That game was referred to as Touchdown Atlantic. The game was played at the new Moncton Stadium on the campus of Université de Moncton in front of a reported sellout crowd of 20,725. Tickets went on sale to the general public on March 25, 2010, with a one-day pre-sale being conducted the day before. After 32 hours of being up for sale, the 2010 Touchdown Atlantic was announced as a sellout on March 25, 2010. The Eskimos won the game 24–6 thanks to their 247 interception return yards on six interceptions, the second most interception return yards in CFL history.
A 2011 Touchdown Atlantic game, somewhat erroneously known as Touchdown Atlantic II, took place during the 2011 CFL season, again in Moncton. The Hamilton Tiger-Cats were the designated home team and faced the Calgary Stampeders on September 25 at Moncton Stadium. Hamilton won the game, 55–36.
No Touchdown Atlantic was held in 2012. The 2013 edition of Touchdown Atlantic featured the Tiger-Cats hosting the Montreal Alouettes in Moncton on September 21. The game was held in Moncton due to their stadium in Hamilton being replaced; although Moncton attempted to have the Tiger-Cats play the whole season in Moncton, the team opted to only play one game there and have the rest of the season closer to Hamilton (specifically Guelph). Hamilton won the game 28–26.
No Touchdown Atlantic was held from 2014 to 2018 as the league lost momentum for the event. However, there was renewed interest in football in the Maritimes when a group of businessmen began discussions with the league for a franchise based in Halifax. While a stadium would still need to be built in Halifax, the discussions were legitimate enough for the league to encourage a season ticket campaign and led to the naming of the team as the Atlantic Schooners (the same as the proposed team from 1982). To promote interest in the event, a Touchdown Atlantic game was announced for 2019 with the event being hosted by this same group, Schooners Sports and Entertainment (SSE). The Argonauts were designated the home team and the Alouettes the visiting team. TSN's Dave Naylor reported that SSE was considering Halifax, Moncton, and Antigonish, Nova Scotia, as potential game sites, with Moncton being the eventual selection. Unlike the 2010–2013 versions, Moncton Stadium was not expanded to host the game, and a sellout crowd of only 10,126 watched as the Alouettes defeated the Argonauts (hosting the game in Moncton to avoid a short-notice conversion after Toronto FC hosted a home game the night before) on August 25, 2019.
On January 23, 2020, it was announced that the Saskatchewan Roughriders would play the Argonauts in a Touchdown Atlantic game that would be the first regular season game to be played in Halifax. The game was scheduled to be played at Huskies Stadium on the campus of Saint Mary's University, where temporary seating would have brought the seating capacity up to 10,000. However, the game was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
While no game was scheduled in 2021 due to the pandemic, it was confirmed on March 24, 2022, that the Argonauts would host the Roughriders in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, at Raymond Field for the first Touchdown Atlantic game to be played in Wolfville. The series continued the following season with the Toronto Argonauts hosting the Saskatchewan Roughriders at Huskies Stadium (Saint Mary's University) in Halifax on Saturday, July 29, 2023. This was the first regular season game held in Halifax after the city hosted a pre-season match in 2005. In June 2023, the league announced the game had sold-out.
Other "Touchdown"-branded games.
CFL Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said in December 2022 that the league was considering hosting other "Touchdown"-branded games in neutral markets outside of Atlantic Canada from 2024. Langford, British Columbia (part of Greater Victoria) was discussed as a potential location for a Touchdown Pacific game at Starlight Stadium beginning in 2024, but on November 29, 2023, it was confirmed that the BC Lions and Ottawa Redblacks would play at Royal Athletic Park in Victoria on August 31, 2024, part of the Labour Day weekend slate of games. Temporary seating was added to expand the capacity to 14,000. The Lions won 38–12, and the attendance was 14,727.
Potential for an Atlantic expansion team.
The initial success of the Touchdown Atlantic games placed Moncton in the position of frontrunner for a Canadian Football League franchise in Atlantic Canada, according to commissioner Mark Cohon. Moncton is also well positioned because of its centralized location in the region; a team based in Moncton would represent all three maritime provinces due to the region's small population. Moncton officials negotiated to temporarily host the Tiger-Cats for the 2013 season while Ivor Wynne Stadium was demolished and Tim Hortons Field was under construction. However, citing a desire to be closer to home, the Tiger-Cats announced they would play eight of their nine home games at nearby Guelph, with the ninth being the Touchdown Atlantic contest.
By 2015, the potential for an expansion to the Maritimes had once again faded, in part due to Cohon's resignation and the failure to sell out the 2013 contest. Focus by this point had shifted to the Northern Kickoff contest at Shell Place in Fort McMurray, Alberta; it was here, rather than in Moncton, that the league chose to host regular season games that had been displaced because of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup or 2015 Pan American Games. Negotiations to bring a CFL team to the Maritimes resumed under the commission of Randy Ambrosie in 2017, with Halifax and Moncton considered as potential homes for the team.

Federal telephone excise tax

The federal telephone excise tax is a statutory federal excise tax imposed under the Internal Revenue Code in the United States under on amounts paid for certain "communications services". The tax was to be imposed on the person paying for the communications services (such as a customer of a telephone company) but, under , is collected from the customer by the "person receiving any payment for facilities or services" on which the tax is imposed (i.e., is collected by the telephone company, which files a quarterly Form 720 excise return and forwards the tax to the Internal Revenue Service).
History.
Although in popular belief the telephone excise tax has been in place continuously since the Spanish–American War, it has actually been repealed and reinstated several times, usually in times of war or economic crisis. Because of this connection to war, the tax has been a frequent target of war tax resisters.
Spanish–American War.
In late April 1898, Congress passed a resolution declaring that a state of war had existed since April 21, 1898, between the United States and Spain. Although the Spanish–American War was short, its financing needs resulted in a federal budget deficit. In the landmark case of "Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Co." the Supreme Court had nullified the income tax of 1894. Many in Congress felt that tariff increases could create too much disturbance with industry. As a result, the leaders in Congress felt that the revenues required for military expenditures either should come from increases in existing domestic taxes or supplements of new taxes of the same type. Thus, in the War Revenue Act of 1898, an excise tax on telephone service was introduced for the first time in 1898. The tax was repealed in 1902, at the end of the Spanish–American related Philippine–American War.
Prelude to World War I.
In August 1914, war broke out in Europe resulting in a precipitous fall in imports to the United States from Europe. One result from the fall in imports was that business profits were reduced, and revenues from the corporation income tax 
declined. This fall in imports also reduced the federal government's customs receipts. On September 4, 1914, President Wilson called upon Congress to raise an additional $100 million through "internal" taxes (in contrast to customs duties). These revenues were needed not only because of the loss of revenues but also because of added federal spending related to the war being fought in Europe. In response, Congress passed the Emergency Internal Revenue Tax Act of 1914. The Act was mostly a renewal of the excises contained in the Spanish–American War Revenue Act. It included a tax of 1 cent for telephone calls costing more than 15 cents. The taxes instituted under this Act were initially set to expire on December 31, 1915. However, on December 17, 1915, Congress passed a joint resolution that continued the taxes instituted in 1914 through December 31, 1916. After that time, while revenue needs continued (for "preparedness"), the Revenue Act of September 1916 did not extend the tax on telephone service.
World War I.
With the entrance of the United States into World War I, revenue needs were greatly increased. Both parties worked together to produce a tax bill. Included in the War Revenue Act of October 3, 1917, was a tax of "5 cents upon each telegraph, telephone, or radio, dispatch, message, or conversation, which originates within the United States, and for the transmission of which a charge of 15 cents or more is imposed." Work on the Revenue Act of 1918 had nearly been completed when the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918. Although World War I had ended, Congress recognized budget expenditures could be expected to decline in the long term but that reductions in expenditures would not occur in the short term. Pay for U.S. military forces could be expected to continue for some time and there was a need to provide capital for reconstruction to U.S. allies in Europe. Thus, this tax measure was redrafted. The redrafted Act not only continued the telephone excise tax but also did so at increased rates that were graduated for the first time. While this Act is referred to as the Revenue Act of 1918, it was not passed until early in 1919. The tax continued until it was repealed in 1924.
Great Depression.
Today's telephone excise tax derives from the Revenue Bill of 1932. Since then, it has been reauthorized 29 times. The 1932 Act was passed in response to a federal budget deficit brought about because of a decline in income tax receipts caused by an economic depression rather than as a result of war. Initially the tax was levied only on interstate (long-distance) service. The telephone excise tax was extended five times (between 1933 and 1941) before the tax was first applied to local telephone service.
World War II.
Just prior to the entrance of the United States into World War II, the Revenue Act of 1941 was passed into law. In addition to increasing the rate on long-distance calls, it also imposed the tax on "general" or local telephone service for the first time. The rate of tax for local telephone service was set at 6 percent of the amount paid by subscribers while that for long-distance calls was set at 5 cents for each 50 cents or fraction thereof, if the cost of the message was greater than 24 cents. Other legislation was subsequently enacted during World War II — the Revenue Act of 1942 and the Revenue Act of 1943. The tax rates on telephone service reached their all-time high under provisions of the Revenue Act of 1943. Rates were 15 percent on local telephone calls and 25 percent (on messages which cost more than 24 cents) on long-distance calls. The Revenue Act of 1943 also provided for the increased excise tax rates to expire. In the case of the excise taxes on telephone service, the law provided that the increased rates would end six months after the "date of termination of hostilities in the present war." The law defined the termination date as that date proclaimed by either the President or the date specified in a concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, whichever is the earlier. In a reversal of this position, the Excise Tax Act of 1947 continued the rates indefinitely.
Codification in the Internal Revenue Code.
With the enactment of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the levies imposed on both local and long-distance calls (for messages costing more than 24 cents) were reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent. The Excise Tax Technical Changes Act of 1958 made no changes in the tax rate on telephone calls, but did remove the 24 cents limitation first provided for in 1942. Both local and long-distance calling were subject to the same tax rate for the first time.
The Tax Rate Extension Act of 1959 provided for the termination of the tax on local telephone service on July 1, 1960. However, a series of one-year extensions was subsequently enacted each year until 1965, when the Excise Tax Reduction Act became law. In 1965, Congress enacted comprehensive legislation which repealed many existing federal excise taxes and authorized the reduction and, in some instances, the gradual reduction and ultimate repeal of other excises over a period of years. This Act authorized the reduction of the 10 percent tax on local and long-distance telephone service to 3 percent which became effective on January 1, 1966. In addition to the reduced rate, the Act provided for the gradual reduction and elimination of the tax on January 1, 1969.
Vietnam War.
By 1966, however, the federal government's revenue requirements had increased due to escalation of the Vietnam War. President Johnson requested that Congress enact legislation to restore the rate of the telephone excise tax to the 10 percent rate in effect prior to January 1, 1966, and that successive reductions which had been authorized by the Excise Tax Reduction Act of 1965 be deferred. Accordingly, Congress enacted the Tax Adjustment Act of 1966. That Act authorized the restoration of the former 10 percent rate on these services beginning on April 1, 1966, for a two-year period (until April 1, 1968), at which time it was to be reduced to 1 percent, before repeal on January 1, 1969.
Again in 1967, President Johnson urged postponement of scheduled reductions in telephone excise taxes as part of his tax program designed to meet the rising cost of the war and increasing domestic needs. A joint Congressional resolution was approved which temporarily extended the 10 percent rate from March 31, 1968, until April 30, 1968. This temporary extension provided Congress time to complete action on the Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968. The 1968 Act continued the 10 percent tax retroactively from April 30, 1968, until December 31, 1969, with provision for its subsequent reduction and repeal by calendar year 1973.
Passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 again granted a one-year extension (this time until December 31, 1970) of the telephone tax at the rate of 10 percent. With passage of the Excise, Estate and Gift Tax Adjustment Act of 1970 the 10 percent rate was extended through calendar years 1971 and 1972. The tax was then to be reduced by 1 percent each year until the tax was scheduled for repeal on January 1, 1982. However, prior to repeal, the tax was extended in 1980 at a 2 percent rate until 1982 when it was scheduled to be reduced to 1 percent before repeal in 1983. In 1981 the tax was extended again. This time the tax was extended at the 1 percent rate for two additional years with repeal scheduled for 1985. However, in the following year, 1982, the tax was increased to a 3 percent rate, with repeal rescheduled for the beginning of calendar year 1986.
In April 1984 both the House of Representatives and the Senate passed legislation calling for a continuation of the current excise tax on telephone service at a 3 percent rate for an additional two years. The legislation enacted provided for repeal in 1988. However, before repeal the tax was again extended at the 3 percent rate this time for an additional three years.
President George H. W. Bush's budget proposal for fiscal year 1991 called for the permanent extension of the telephone excise tax at the prevailing rate of 3%. Since the tax had been a continuous revenue source since 1932 and because of large continuing budget deficits, Congress concurred with the President's recommendation and made the tax a permanent part of the tax revenue structure with the enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990.
On September 14, 2000, the House of Representatives took up legislation which included the repeal of the telephone excise tax. Under provisions contained in H.R. 4516, which was a package of both spending and tax bills, the 3% tax on communication services would be immediately repealed. After passage by the Congress, President Clinton vetoed this legislation.
The general excise tax has so far cost consumers about $300 billion, says the Congressional Research Service.
Until the middle of 2006, the tax was collected by telephone companies with respect to local and long-distance telephone services. Collection of the tax on most long-distance service was then halted due to a controversy that erupted over the wording of the law and the way telephone service is billed today.
Controversy and litigation.
On May 10, 2005, The American Bankers Insurance Group won an important victory in the fight against the telephone excise tax, when the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the decision of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, which had held that the services that ABIG purchased from AT&amp;T were taxable.
This was one of several U.S. Court of Appeals cases that the Internal Revenue Service lost on the same issue. The IRS withdrew only after losing several of such cases and winning none (at the Appeals level or higher).
A key issue in the controversy was the legal definition of "toll telephone service" as defined in section 4252(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides (in part):
Concession by the Internal Revenue Service.
On 25 May 2006, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued IRS Notice 2006-50, 2006 I.R.B. 25, which stated in part:
[... ] the Internal Revenue Service will follow the holdings of Am. Bankers Ins. Group v. United States, 408 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir. 2005) (ABIG); OfficeMax, Inc. v. United States, 428 F.3d 583 (6th Cir. 2005); Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. United States, 431 F.3d 374 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (Amtrak); Fortis v. United States, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 10749 (2d Cir. Apr. 27, 2006); and Reese Bros. v. United States, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 11468 (3d Cir. May 9, 2006). These cases hold that a telephonic communication for which there is a toll charge that varies with elapsed transmission time "and not distance" (time-only service) is not taxable toll telephone service as defined in §4252(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, amounts paid for time-only service are not subject to the tax imposed by §4251. Accordingly, the government will no longer litigate this issue [...] [emphasis added]
The IRS also provided the following definitions in Notice 2006-50:
IRS Notice 2006-50 also states (in part):
Collectors [e.g., telephone companies] are directed to cease collecting and paying over tax under §4251 on nontaxable service that is billed after July 31, 2006, and are not required to report to the IRS any refusal by their customers to pay any tax on nontaxable service that is billed after May 25, 2006. Collectors should not pay over to the IRS any tax on nontaxable service that is billed after July 31, 2006. [...] [T]he IRS will deny all taxpayer requests for refund of tax on nontaxable service that was billed after July 31, 2006. All such requests should be directed to the collector [e.g., to the telephone company]. In addition, collectors may repay to taxpayers the tax on nontaxable service that was billed before August 1, 2006, but are not required to repay such tax. [...] Collectors must continue to collect and pay over tax under §4251 on amounts paid for local only service.
The wording of the statute itself (section 4251) was not changed or repealed. (As a general rule, a U.S. Federal statute can be repealed only by another statute subsequently enacted by the U.S. Congress.) The change was a change in the enforcement policy of the Internal Revenue Service to conform to the literal language of the statute and the court decisions interpreting the statute. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow stated in a prepared release, "Today is a good day for American taxpayers; it marks the beginning of the end of an outdated, antiquated tax that has survived a century beyond its original purpose, and by now should have been ancient history." Snow also called on the United States Congress "to terminate the remainder of this antique tax by repealing the excise tax on local service as well." 
On January 25, 2011, Rep. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) introduced H.R. 428, a bill "To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise tax on telephone and other communications services"; it was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, but was not enacted.
Credits against federal income tax.
Individuals and other entities including non-profit organizations and businesses were able to receive a credit for the unlawfully collected tax when they filed their 2006 federal income tax returns. Certain persons who paid the long-distance tax on service billed after February 28, 2003, but before August 1, 2006, were eligible for the credit. The three-year lookback period coincides with the statute of limitations for tax refunds. The refund was available to all individuals and corporations which paid the tax, including the deceased and defunct organizations, until July 27, 2012. 
However, the IRS stated in 2007 that millions of taxpayers failed to take the credit, leaving $4 billion still to be claimed. The credit can be claimed by those who neglected to take it, but only by amending a 2006 tax return.
The IRS offered two methods for computing the amount of the credit due to individuals:
Businesses and tax exempt organizations may either claim the actual amount of excise tax by either calculating the actual amount of tax paid during the lookback period or using an estimate method. The special method involves comparing the April 2006 phone bill with the excise tax on long-distance service and the September 2006 bill without it. The percentage difference in the excise tax, subject to a 1% or 2% maximum cap, can be applied to annual or quarterly telephone bills to determine the credit. In all cases, interest will be paid on refunds.

Tania Aebi

Tania Aebi (born October 7, 1966) is an American sailor. She completed a solo circumnavigation of the globe in a 26-foot sailboat between the ages of 18 and 21, finishing it in 1987, making her the first American woman and the youngest person (at the time) to sail around the world. Her record was not recognized by Guinness, because she sailed through the Panama Canal, which required assistance. She also sailed eighty miles with a friend in the South Pacific. (For the first American woman to attain the relevant Guinness World Record, see Karen Thorndike.) Despite many challenges, Aebi accomplished her goal.
Voyage.
Aebi did not take much of a sailing background on her voyage. In 1984, when Aebi was sixteen, just before finishing up with an alternative high-school a year early, her father bought a boat in the UK to sail it back across the Atlantic to New York City. Aebi went with him and in a course of a year they sailed from the UK to Spain, Portugal, Morocco, the Canary Islands, the Caribbean, Bermuda and the whole group of Islands, heading back to New York City and arriving there in 1985. They did so as novices.
During a year-long trip from England to New York City with her father, Aebi learned the basics of sailing.
In May 1985, before the circumnavigation, Aebi took a correspondence course in celestial navigation.
Aebi had practically no sailing or navigation experience when she departed on her journey, on May 28, 1985. She was eighteen years old when she departed. Aebi did not have a GPS receiver because civilian GPS receivers were unavailable. Instead, Aebi had a sextant for celestial navigation and a radio direction finder. She used the first leg of her trip from New Jersey to Bermuda as a sea trial of her boat.
Reactions.
Hearing of her father's round-the-world offer, many sailors accused Ernst Aebi of taking a cavalier attitude toward his daughter's safety, to which he responded: 
Boat.
Aebi set out on her circumnavigation in her $40,000 sloop, "Varuna", on May 28, 1985, her only other sailing experience being a six-month cruise of the Atlantic she had made with her father, her two sisters and her brother. "Varuna" was called so after a Vedic deity associated with sky, waters, justice and truth. The boat was a Taylor 26, a Canadian version of Contessa 26, which cost $40,000. Aebi's arrival back in New York City on November 6, 1987, after a cold November, transit across the Atlantic on Varuna was heralded nationally by the news media.
Upon Aebi's arrival in New York on Varuna, President Reagan sent Aebi a message saying: 
Global circumnavigation route.
In May 1985, with only few months of limited sailing experience, Aebi sailed away from a New York City dock, bound for Bermuda in her small boat. In November 1987 Aebi returned to New York City.
Sponsorship.
Aebi's journey was sponsored in part by "Cruising World" magazine, for which she had written articles.
After Aebi's return from her 3-year long voyage, "Cruising World" magazine commented: 
Later activities.
Tarzoon, the cat who traveled more than half the world around with Aebi, survived for more than 20 years and died peacefully in its sleep just before she was to undertake a new voyage with her two teenage sons in 2008. She and her sons sailed a newly acquired steel monohull across the Caribbean and South Pacific during 2008. Aebi traded off with the boys' father, her ex-husband Olivier Berner, in Papeete, Tahiti. Olivier and his sons continued their cruising passage from there.

Aebi recounts the story of her solo-circumnavigation in her book "Maiden Voyage" which became a bestseller in the United States in 1989. The book is a story of teenage angst, self-discovery and adventure. Aebi's story is unusual because she was, by many standards, poorly prepared for her voyage. But she prevailed through common sense, skills she both learned and honed underway, as well as a strong sense of determination.
Recent work.
In 2005 Aebi published her second book, "I've Been Around".
As editor.
Aebi writes monthly columns for several sailing and cruising magazines.
In popular culture.
In September 2017 it was announced that Aebi's memoir "Maiden Voyage" will be adapted into a film, with the working title of "Girl at Sea". The adaptation was bought by Cohen Media Group in 2017 with the film script written by screenwriter Joel Silverman.

County Trunk Highways (Wisconsin)

County trunk highways (also called County Highway, CTH; for national mapping software/app consistency, CR, or County Road are also used) are highways maintained at the county level or below in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Every county maintains its own county trunk highway system.
Description.
Wisconsin uses letters as designations for its county roads. Highways may be labeled with a single letter (CTH-H), double letter (CTH-LL or CTH-AB) or triple letter (CTH-BBB). Roads are usually named sequentially, although the letter designation may stand for the initials of a road, a geographical feature, a political division (such as CTH-KR along the Kenosha–Racine county line), or in honor of a person. Two county highways running concurrently on the same roadway often take on both letters on that portion; for instance two highways designated CTH-J and CTH-L would take the designation CTH-JL on a certain route before their divergence down the road, returning to their individual route designations thereafter.
Designations may be repeated within a single county, depending on the size and population of the county. Designations may continue over a county line. Usually the letter designation remains the same when the route is a former state highway that has been decommissioned and turned over to county control. There are no east–west or north–south pattern restrictions on which letters can be used for a road, and they can be looped around counties and metropolitan areas. County highways can also run concurrently with state and U.S. Highways (the most prominent for the latter being a portion of CTH-M in Dane County Highway M that overlaps the Madison Beltline); there are no current concurrencies with county highways and Interstates.
For the most part, all county highway systems in the state are surfaced asphalt or concrete, though a few lightly-traveled historic roads (often designated by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation as Rustic Roads) are gravel roads.
History.
County trunk highways first came into being in 1921. The first county highways were independent of the state's trunk highway system and lacked state legislative approval. By 1924, every county in Wisconsin had set up its own county highway system, with the state authorizing county highways in 1925.

Dorothy Dietrich

Dorothy Dietrich (born April 1, 1948) is an American stage magician and escapologist, best known for performing the bullet catch in her mouth (although Adelaide Herrmann reputedly did this earlier) and the first woman to perform a straitjacket escape while suspended hundreds of feet in the air from a burning rope. She was the first woman to gain prominence as an escape artist since the days of Houdini, breaking the glass ceiling for women in the field of escapes and magic.
The 2006 "Columbia Encyclopedia" included Dietrich among their "eight most noted magicians of the late 20th century", and entertainment writer Samantha Hart in "Hollywood Walk of Fame: 2000 Sensational Stars, Star Makers and Legends", called her a "world-class magician" and "one of the world's leading female magicians". Early on, as a teenager, she already was referred to as "The First Lady of Magic", a reference later copied by others. Dietrich, often called the female Houdini, has duplicated many of Houdini's original escapes, and has gone one step further by doing the Jinxed Bullet Catch Stunt – the one that Houdini backed away from.
Early career.
Dorothy Dietrich is a native of Erie, Pennsylvania. In a six-page article about the history of women in magic in the women's magazine, "Bust", which contained only two full-page pictures, one of Adelaide Herrmann and the other of Dietrich, Nichole Summer writes: 
Among the books that inspired her as a child was a biography of Houdini, who became a childhood idol, a fact that later influenced her desire to perform magic and escapes.
Early on, she learned her craft mostly from books. In New York, she auditioned for Westchester Department of Parks from an ad in a show business newspaper and was booked on the spot for a full summer of work, was recommended to the school district for the winter months, and re-booked the following summer for an increase in dates and price. Around this same time she earned her performing chops working a dime museum "grind show" Ten-in-One operation in Times Square run by legendary mouse pitchman Tommy Laird with such performers as Earl "Presto" Johnson, Lou Lancaster, Chris Capehart, Dick Brooks (a.k.a., Brookz), and others. Showcasing for the Parent Assembly of the Society of American Magicians at about the same time, well-known magicians Russell Swann and Walter B. Gibson, captivated by her performance style, took her under their wing. Walter Gibson, who was a confidant and biographer of Houdini's, said "What you have is very reminiscent of Houdini, when Houdini came out on stage, the audience automatically fell in love with him. In my long years I've never seen anyone who had that." Dietrich also studied with "Coney Island Fakir" Al Flosso (for the coin routine), a regular performer on the Ed Sullivan television show, Jack London (for the bullet catch) and Lou Lancaster with the Milk Can and the Straitjacket escape, as well as sleight-of-hand magic. "The recognition gradually put Dorothy Dietrich and her magic into resort hotels, nightclubs, school and college auditoriums, trade shows." She became a favorite of several New York booking agents.
Innovative routines.
She developed what is known as a flash act that included doves, a rabbit, a duck and two poodles. Early on she was considered a "leading dove worker". She also developed several routines few women had ever attempted. Sawing men in half, escaping from a straitjacket, sleight of hand with coins via the Misers Dream, The Bullet Catch, and levitating audience members. It was her goal to level the playing field between men and women in the field of magic, and to innovate and break barriers where no women, and in some cases no men, have gone. Until she broke many of these barriers, women were not allowed full membership in organizations such as The Society of American Magicians, which she tried to join. She has pioneered and paved the way for women in the field today.
Dietrich has created special shows for such companies as Maidenform, Pooltrol, Yago Sangria, Manhattan Shirts, as well as fashion and cosmetic companies. She is a regular performer for trade and industrial events.
Television.
On television, Dorothy Dietrich won attention as a woman who, instead of allowing herself to be sawed in half, reversed the traditional illusion and severed into two parts the male hosts of talk shows and network specials. As word got around she was called to do a Bill Cosby special while still in her early teens, but with the help of her sophisticated style and makeup she passed as an adult and was able to work night clubs and banquets in the best hotels and venues. Cosby was so impressed that he recommended her to several agents. At this same time she performed with Loretta Lynn, Dick Van Patten, Henny Youngman, Jonathan Winters, and Tony Randall.
Dietrich was co-editor, contributor and publisher of "Hocus Pocus Magazine" along with magician/mentalist Dick Brooks. In addition to escapes and large-scale stunts, Dietrich has performs illusions with live animals such as doves, rabbits, poodles and ducks. She is also known for sawing men in half. She also does an updated version of the classic Miser's Dream, plucking coins from the air, nose, ears and pockets of a youngster from the audience. She is also known for levitating volunteers from the audience.
The bullet catch.
In 2008, "Bust" reported about Dietrich's 1988 attempt to catch a bullet in a metal cup in her mouth. She performed it at Donald Trump's Resorts International's 10th anniversary in Atlantic City, New Jersey. It was televised on a special called, "Just For The Record, The Best Of Everything." This came about after catching a .22 caliber bullet for the yearly convention of the International Brotherhood of Magicians in Pittsburgh. It was shown on Network TV's "Evening Magazine", and on "The New You Asked For It" with Rich Little as host. She performed it again in Canada on a TV show called "Autobus du Canada" for the highest amount ever paid a magician on Canadian television. It was done under test conditions with the bullets bought by a committee. Brought in under guard, an independent marksman picked and fired the bullet. One of two chosen bullets was fired into a concrete backstop and the second was fired at Dorothy. Dietrich challenged anyone who could prove that the bullet did not leave from the gun by offering a $10,000 reward. Feature stories and articles about her have appeared in major publications such as "The New York Times" and "TV Guide".
Houdini Magical Hall of Fame.
On exhibit for many years at the Houdini Magical Hall of Fame in Niagara Falls, Canada, until it burned down, was a large two-panel display of Dorothy Dietrich and her accomplishments as "The Female Houdini". A similar display is now shown at Scranton's Houdini Museum.
The Houdini seances.
For many years she held the Houdini seances in New York as a tribute to the legendary magician, continuing a tradition started by Houdini's wife and passed on to Walter B. Gibson. Even though Bess gave up the séances herself, she asked magician Walter B. Gibson to carry on the October 31 tradition. For many years, Gibson, along with several other magicians, held the séances at the Magic Towne House in New York City. Before Gibson died he asked Dietrich to carry on the tradition. Walter was a confidant and biographer of Houdini and also wrote the famous "Shadow" series. Dietrich continues the seances at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania, each Halloween, the day Houdini died. The seances have been shown on such shows as "TV Land: Myths and Legends", Biography's "Dead Famous-Houdini" and "Exploring the Unknown". The seances at the Houdini Museum in Scranton are often attended by the Houdini family, who are the closest living relatives of Bess Houdini, making this the closest event connected back to the original seances that Bess Houdini held.
Debunker.
Dietrich also crusades against those who falsely claim to speak to dead relatives of vulnerable grieving citizens. Early on, Dietrich realized that there were those who would use magic and various deceptive arts to manipulate and even cheat people out of money. So following in the footsteps of famous debunkers who came before her, such as Houdini, Milbourne Christopher and James Randi, she takes on such a role where possible. She has a $10,000 reward for anyone who says they can contact the spirit of Houdini. Those who have tried, unsuccessfully, include Canadian television "medium" Kim Dennis, who had contacted the Houdini family claiming she was getting messages from Houdini.
Traveling Houdini exhibit.
Dietrich also sends out the world's only continuous traveling Houdini exhibit. Besides featuring it as part of her many shows, it has also traveled to corporations, banks, and casinos.
Restoration and upkeep of the Houdini grave site.
On September 27, 2011, a group she formed, that came to be known in the media as The Houdini Commandos, secretly replaced the statuary bust at Houdini's grave site: Machpelah Cemetery (Queens) that had been missing due to vandalism for 36 years. This was reported in a half-page story worldwide in "The New York Times" on October 24, 2011. Her world-famous attraction, Scranton's Houdini Museum that she runs with mystery entertainer Dick Brooks, has been asked by both the family of Houdini and the management of the Machpelah Cemetery (Queens) to take over the upkeep of the grave that has been in disarray for many years. In 2013 she petitioned The Society of American Magicians, magic's most prestigious and wealthiest organization, thanks to Houdini, to help take over the care of the grave site at Machpelah Cemetery (Queens), which they agreed to by unanimous vote. Dietrich commented on this, "I will not live forever, but The Society of American Magicians will!" Because of their work over the years, in 2016 Dietrich and Brooks were given the highest honor that can be bestowed on any magician: The Society of American Magicians rare Presidential Citation for their work in promoting the art of magic.
Dietrich Uncovers Houdini's Long Lost Best Film "The Grim Game".
Long considered by film buffs as lost, Dietrich was aware since her teens that the only copy of Houdini's "The Grim Game" was buried in the apartment of Brooklyn collector Larry Weeks. She had seen it several times along with her partner Dick Brooks and attempted to acquire it from him several times to no avail. Finally with the help of film producer Rick Schmidlin she got him to turn it over to Turner Classic Movies and produce the restoration, who then put up the funding to have it professionally restored and commissioned two new movie scores to be added to the film. Turner flew Dietrich and Brooks to Hollywood to introduce the film as the climax to their week long yearly film festival. As part of the festival Turner asked Dorothy to perform a challenge strait jacket escape for which she got a standing ovation. Larry Weeks, who was ill and 96 years old died about 5 months before the showing in March. As a tribute to Weeks she demonstrated a trick vest of Houdini's that she had acquired from Weeks as a teenager. Dietrich and Brooks are featured on the second title card of the restored film, which was shown on television the following October. "Because of our efforts more people and future magicians will now see Houdini's best work, than saw him in his entire lifetime!" said the two.

Marlowe (1969 film)

Marlowe is a 1969 American neo-noir film starring James Garner as Raymond Chandler's private detective Philip Marlowe. Directed by Paul Bogart, the film was written by Stirling Silliphant based on Chandler's 1949 novel "The Little Sister".
The supporting cast includes Bruce Lee, Gayle Hunnicutt, Rita Moreno, Sharon Farrell, Carroll O'Connor and Jackie Coogan.
Plot.
Los Angeles private eye Philip Marlowe has been hired by Orfamay Quest, a young woman from Kansas, to find her brother, Orrin. Marlowe searches Orrin's former hotel room and interviews the shady hotel guest, Grant Hicks, he finds there. Returning downstairs he comes across the dead body of desk clerk, Haven Clausen, killed with an ice pick. Soon afterwards Hicks phones Marlowe to hire him to hold onto something for a day or two. When Marlowe gets to his location he finds Hicks dead with an ice pick buried in his neck. A masked, armed woman comes up behind Marlowe and knocks him out and flees. When he recovers, Marlowe searches the room and finds a claim ticket for a roll of photographs. He tells some of what happened to the police, but keeps the most important information to himself. Marlowe recalls that years earlier a crime gang in Brooklyn led by mobster Sonny Steelgrave had perfected a technique for killing its enemies with an ice pick, but they agree the connection is tenuous.
Marlowe tracks down the masked woman. She is television star Mavis Wald, and the photos are of her in a passionate rendezvous with the mobster boss Steelgrave, who has moved his operation west. Marlowe realizes that the murders stemmed from an initial attempt at blackmail. Marlowe calls on Wald, and while waiting to speak to her meets Wald’s friend, exotic dancer Dolores Gonzales. In private, Marlowe tells Wald his suspicion that she was at the hotel where Hicks was killed to pay him off, in return for the photos. He offers Wald his help, but she rejects it. Steelgrave makes several attempts to assault, scare or buy Marlowe off the case but they are all unsuccessful, resulting only in the death of an erudite Steelgrave henchman.
Orfamay tells Marlowe her brother is staying at the clinic of Dr. Vincent Lagardie, a connection Marlowe already knew of. He contacts an executive from Wald's hit TV show and secures a contract to work in her best interest. Marlowe questions Wald again, and from what he learns is able to clear her and Steelgrave of the murders. Marlowe then goes to the clinic and confronts the doctor, who tranquilizes him with a drugged cigarette but otherwise does not harm him. Marlowe comes to during the night and, still groggy, searches the clinic. He hears gunshots and stumbles upon the dying Orrin, who has just enough strength to stab Marlowe with an ice pick, however not seriously. Marlowe finds a photograph that reveals that Orfamay, Orrin and Wald are siblings. This makes Marlowe certain that Orrin was the blackmailer, who later killed Clausen and Hicks because they knew details of the blackmail scheme. Marlowe gets his wound tended to by Dolores. Now closely connected to another death, Marlowe is only able to keep the police at bay with a promise to solve the cases.
Marlowe returns to his office and burns the photos and negatives. He gets a visit from Dolores, who tells him Wald wants to see him at the mobster Steelgrave’s home. They leave watched by Dr. Lagardie. During their ride Marlowe learns that Dolores and Steelgrave had been romantically involved. Marlowe finds Steelgrave dead, and Wald disconsolate. She tells him she killed Steelgrave because he had her brother killed. To protect Wald's reputation, Marlowe makes it look as if Steelgrave committed suicide. However the police are not fooled, and the irate Lieutenant in charge resolves to have Marlowe’s private detective license revoked.
Marlowe catches Orfamay searching his home and tells her he has destroyed the photographs and negatives. Wald arrives and a heated confrontation between the women reveals that Orfamay knew about Orrin's blackmailing scheme and was expecting some money from it. When he disappeared she subsequently told Steelgrave where to find Orrin, in return for one thousand dollars. However she had expected Marlowe to stop Steelgrave from harming Orrin. Marlowe breaks up the fight between the sisters and manhandles the sobbing Orfamay out of his home, telling her to go back to Kansas. Wald admits to Marlowe, who had already deduced it, that she pretended to have killed Steelgrave to protect her sister, who she thought had actually killed him.
Marlowe confronts Dolores, from offstage while she is performing her nightclub act, with his suspicions that she was Orrin's original partner in the blackmail. She did so, Marlowe suggests, because she was still in love with Steelgrave and wanted to force him and Wald apart. He also tells Dolores he thinks she was once married to Dr. Lagardie, when he was a young doctor in Brooklyn. Still dancing on stage, Dolores, when she gets near the side curtain where Marlowe is standing, admits to everything. She is scornful of Marlowe having this knowledge, saying he will never tell the police, as it would destroy Wald’s career. Marlowe leaves the backstage area of the club just as Dr. Lagardie enters from a rear door. The two men see each other, without incident. Marlowe phones the police. Moments later Dr. Lagardie steps out and shoots Dolores dead. The doctor then shoots himself. Marlowe leaves the club before the police arrive.
Production.
In 1968, the last three (of the seven) Marlowe novels had not yet been filmed: "The Little Sister", "The Long Goodbye", and "Playback". In March 1967 it was announced that film rights to "Little Sister" were purchased by the team of Katzka and Berne who had hired Stirling Silliphant to write a script; MGM would distribute. In June Katzka announced that he had also bought screen rights to "The Long Goodbye" and that filming on "Little Sister" would begin in September. However filming was delayed.
In March 1968 it was announced a film would be made of "The Little Sister" starring James Garner with Paul Bogart to make his debut as director. Garner had to plead his case to appear in the film after one MGM executive vetoed his role in the film. Gayle Hunnicut's casting was announced in June.
Filming started in July 1968. It took place in Los Angeles. Stirling Silliphant said he was interested in writing the script "because here was a chance to write the classic Quest story" and it would get the writer "out of the social conscience bag I'm supposed to be in." Silliphant said he had to create "90% of the dialogue" because he felt Chandler's original was "dated".
In his memoirs Garner says he ad libbed the words "impertinent" and "baroque" in one scene when his character was describing wine because Gore Vidal had just referenced Garner's backside in the novel "Myra Breckinridge" as "impertinent" and "baroque".
James Garner would go on to play a private detective in the NBC television series "The Rockford Files" (1974-1980). Over the course of the show Kenneth Tobey (2 times), William Daniels (2), Paul Stevens (2), Christopher Cary (2) and Corinne Camacho (4 times) made guest appearances in different roles. Rita Moreno appeared in 3 episodes, as the same character.
Reception.
Box office.
In Europe, the film sold 375,668 tickets in Spain and 120,408 tickets in France, for a total of 496,076 tickets sold in Spain and France. The film's box-office performance in North America is currently unknown.
Critical reception.
The film has a score of 63% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 8 reviews.
Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and said it was "not very satisfactory. Even though director Paul Bogart shot on location, he has not quite captured the gritty quality of Chandler's LA. And James Garner, the latest Marlowe (after Robert Montgomery, Dick Powell and Humphrey Bogart), is a little too inclined to play for light, wry, James Bond-style laughs." Roger Greenspun of "The New York Times" wrote that "Stirling Silliphant's screenplay follows too many styles, and Paul Bogart's direction follows too few to make a more than casually entertaining movie." Gene Siskel of the "Chicago Tribune" gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and called it "a muddled disappointment. The plot, or more exactly the three or four subplots, is bewildering." "Variety" wrote, "Raymond chandler's private eye character, Philip Marlowe, is in need of better handling either producers Gabriel Katzka and Sidney Beckerman, scripter Stirling Silliphant or James Garner in title role, have provided, if he is to survive as a screen hero. 'Marlowe,' which MGM is releasing, is a plodding, unsure piece of so-called sleuthing in which Garner can never make up his mind whether to play it for comedy or hardboil. Silliphant's adaptation of author's 'The Little Sister' come[s] out on the confused side, with too much unexplained action." Kevin Thomas of the "Los Angeles Times" wrote that the film "fills that yawning gap between the blockbuster and the small-scale film of social consciousness in thoroughly satisfying fashion. Free from the giganticism of the first and the all-too-frequent pretensions of the second it is ideal escapist entertainment." Gary Arnold of "The Washington Post" called it "a tolerable detective thriller provided you haven't read any of Raymond Chandler's novels or seen Howard Hawks' film version of 'The Big Sleep.' If you have, it will be natural to write off this film as a half-hearted, anachronistic attempt to revive the genre." "The Monthly Film Bulletin" wrote, "Despite some crisp dialogue in Stirling Silliphant's screenplay, Chandler's novel "The Little Sister" suffers badly from glossy settings and modish direction ... And Marlowe himself seems a thoroughly synthetic creation—although Garner has a good line in 'cool', he has none of the heavy-lidded cynicism and crumpled charm with which Bogart made the part his own."

Naval Support Activity New Orleans was a United States Navy installation until September 2011. During its time in operation, it was the largest military installation in greater New Orleans. It hosts activities for other branches of service and federal agencies. The address for the EastBank side of the base is 4400 Dauphine Street.
The installation met the needs of military personnel, both in and behind the battle. Home to nearly 3900 active-duty and 2,700 civilian personnel, the facility spreads over both banks of the Mississippi River.
NSA New Orleans was previously home to:
The base was previously home to Commander, Navy Reserve Forces Command, until that command's relocation to Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia in March 2009 pursuant to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission. Commander, Naval Air Force Reserve was relocated to Naval Base Coronado / Naval Air Station North Island alongside Commander, Naval Air Forces and the Naval Reserve Personnel Center was disestablished and its activities merged with the active duty Bureau of Naval Personnel / Navy Personnel Command (BUPERS / NAVPERSCOM) at NSA Mid-South in Millington, Tennessee.
Established in the early 1900s, but inactive for long periods, the facility was reborn in 1939. Between 1944 and 1966, the base progressed from a U.S. Naval Station to the Headquarters, Support Activity, New Orleans. In 1966, the Army, which owned the property on the river's east bank, transferred ownership to the Navy, thus establishing the command known as Naval Support Activity New Orleans.
Base housing was limited to 300 units. Other amenities included a 22-unit Navy Lodge transient billeting facility, a Family Service Center, a childcare center for 42 children, a medium-sized commissary, a Navy Exchange, and a Naval Medical Clinic. Recreational activities included an arts and crafts center, auto hobby center, and a base library.
Early history.
The land underlying the Naval Support Activity is part of an immense West Bank concession given to Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, founder of New Orleans, in 1719 by the Compagnie des Indes. The land changed hands numerous times before being purchased by the United States government on 1849-02-14 for the site of a proposed Navy yard. The Navy yard was not built, however, and the land was leased off for farming. In May of that year, additional ground was purchased by the Navy to enlarge the original site.
In November 1901, the Naval Dry Dock YFD-2 arrived and the US Naval Station was formally established. In 1902, the Commandant, Eighth Naval District received almost $4 million for the new buildings and improvements to the station. Additional property was obtained in 1903 giving the Navy almost three-fourths of a mile of valuable river frontage.
The original buildings, some of which still stand, were completed on the site in 1903. Also located on the grounds is the LeBeuf-Ott Country Retreat, built in 1840. Today, that home is known simply as Quarters "A" and is occupied by the area's senior Naval flag officer.
The Naval Station remained open until September 1911. Following four years of inactivity, it was reopened in 1915 as an industrial Navy yard for repair of vessels. The station continued in full operation until June 1933, when it was placed in a maintenance status. During the Great Depression, the Louisiana Emergency Relief Administration and later, the WPA, operated the third largest transient camp in the United States on the Naval Station. Opened in May 1934, the transient camp sheltered, worked, and trained approximately 25,000 homeless men before it closed in March 1936. In December 1939, the station was reactivated and eventually became a base to handle transient naval personnel. In August 1940, the Navy transferred the YFD-2 to Pearl Harbor, where it was sunk during the attack on December 7, 1941 as it drydocked the .
In September 1944, the station was designated the U.S. Naval Repair Base New Orleans. However, just three years later, it was designated as U.S. Naval Station New Orleans, a name it held until January 1962, when it became the Headquarters, Support Activity New Orleans. The latter name came about to reflect the fact that the Headquarters, Eighth Naval District was aboard the station as the senior-most tenant command.
World War I and World War II.
Located on the East Bank of the Mississippi River are the three largest buildings of the Naval Support Activity. The three giant buildings that tower six floors above the river each contain over one half million square feet of floor space and house a major part of NSA tenants.
The of land and three buildings have a history that began in June 1919, when the buildings were constructed for the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps for use as a general logistical depot during World War I.
These buildings were partially used by the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps after completion until February 1931, when Buildings 601 and 602 were leased to the Board of Commissioners, Port of New Orleans.
With the advent of World War II, the lease was canceled and the installation reverted to complete use by the military as the New Orleans Port of Embarkation under the United States Army Transportation Corps. In 1955, the tract of land was known as the New Orleans Army Terminal. In 1965 the name was changed to the New Orleans Army Base.
In modern times.
There was an expanding naval presence in the lower Mississippi Delta in the mid-1960s. In June 1966, the New Orleans Army Base transferred to the U.S. Navy. July 1966 saw the disestablishment of the Headquarters, Support Activity and the establishment of Naval Support Activity New Orleans to reflect the changing mission of the station. With this change in mission and designation, both sides of the river began serving as the Naval Support Activity for the first time.
In honor of the Louisiana congressman who chaired the House Armed Services Committee, the three buildings were renamed to F. Edward Hebert Defense Complex in 1975.
The Naval Support Activity was the host for the Headquarters of the nation's Marine Corps Reserve forces and a portion of its Navy Reserve forces, along with approximately 40 other commands serving all aspects of military life.
The following is taken from https://web.archive.org/web/20160405120706/http://www.brac.gov/:
The Naval Support Activity New Orleans was on the list of proposed military bases to be closed, submitted to the 2005 Defense Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission. New Orleans, Louisiana, and Federal officials proposed that the base be converted to a "Federal City", housing regional Homeland Security offices and other federal agencies. This idea was considered favorably by the BRAC commissioners who were touring the base. Apparently this idea was accepted, because in the September 8, 2005 BRAC Commission Final Report Submitted to the President, the Naval Support Activity was not included in the list of facilities to be closed. However, the base closed on 15 September 2011.
In July 2024, after being abandoned since 2011, $20 million of federal funding has been earmarked out of the $166 million needed to complete the "NSA Eastbank Apartments".

Farhan Saeed

Farhan Saeed (born 14 September 1984) is a Pakistani singer-songwriter, actor and entrepreneur. Saeed is the former lead vocalist of the Pakistani band Jal and owns the Cafe Rock restaurant in Lahore. He sings in Urdu and Punjabi. He made his acting debut with the drama "De Ijazat Jo Tu" (2014).
Saeed had his breakthrough with "Udaari", for which he received the Hum Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination. He earned wider recognition with his portrayals in "Suno Chanda" (2018), "Suno Chanda 2" (2019) and "Mere Humsafar" (2021-22). The former won him Hum Award for Best Actor Popular. Saeed made his film debut with "Tich Button" (2022).
Early life and career.
Farhan Saeed Butt was born into a Punjabi-Kashmiri family. Both his parents are practicing doctors. A music fan from the very start, he used to listen to Vital Signs and Junoon and centred his music around pop, and at times folk. In his teens, he took A-level from the Keynesian Institute of Management and Sciences (KIMS) and then enrolled in Computer Science at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, after which he discovered his future band members Atif Aslam and Goher Mumtaz. The band took off and became famous across Asia.
In 2011, reports broke out that he had parted his ways from Jal, which left his fans stunned. He pursued a solo career and became regular to feature in Bollywood. Saeed opened "Cafe Rock" restaurant at Hussain Chowk, situated off the M. M. Alam Road, Gulberg, Lahore. His restaurant's theme is in a similar vein to that of the "Hard Rock Cafes", providing underground bands and young aspiring artists with a platform to project themselves and perform in front of an audience.
Music career.
Jal the band.
Saeed first rose to prominence when he joined the Lahore-based pop rock band Jal, at the age of 17, as a vocalist.
Saeed replaced Atif Aslam in 2003, who quit because of musical differences with Jal's founding member Goher Mumtaz.
Solo music career.
In September 2011, in an exclusive interview with "The Express Tribune", Saeed shocked the fans claiming that he had left Jal to pursue a solo career despite Goher Mumtaz offering him to continue his solo career while being a part of Jal. On 8 September 2011, Saeed's departure was confirmed by Jal's guitarist Goher Mumtaz who wished him luck for his solo career. He did a collaboration with Aima Baig, Adnan Qazi and Bilal Saeed for his super hit song "Na cher malangaan nu". His recent song was with Hania Aamir for Asim Jofa that was directed by Qasim Ali Mureed.
He made his Bollywood-singing breakthrough in 2014, by contributing a song to Vikram Bhatt's "Creature 3D". The song, "Naam-e-Wafa", is a romantic-duet with Indian vocalist Tulsi Kumar as the co-singer and Mithoon as the composer.
Acting career.
Saeed started his acting career by debuting in a leading role in the 2014 Hum TV drama serial "De Ijazat Jo Tu" alongside Sohai Ali Abro, Saba Hameed and Javaid Sheikh. He then played the lead role as Mohid Shuja in ARY Digital's "Mere Ajnabi" alongside Urwa Hocane who was the female lead. He has also played the lead role of Arsh in the drama "Udaari" as a lawyer along with female lead Urwa. Apart from acting in the drama, Saeed has also collaborated with Hadiqa Kiani for the OST that has topped music charts all over Pakistan.
In 2016, he also played the lead role again in ARY Digital's "Teri Chah Mein", alongside Maria Wasti and Saboor Ali, and Hum TV's "Sila" alongside Ainy Jaffri.
In 2018 he grabbed the leading role of Arsal Jamshed Ali (Arsal) in Hum TV's critically and commercially superhit drama serial "Suno Chanda", with Iqra Aziz as the leading female role, and due to the critical success of the show, a season 2 was immediately announced by the producers. He reprised his role as Arsal Jamshed Ali in the second installment of Suno Chanda alongside Iqra Aziz in 2019. The season was also a hit and a critical success.
He had the leading role in "Karachi Se Lahore 3" with Kubra Khan as co-star, the third installment of Wajahat Rauf's successful series including the box-office hits "Karachi Se Lahore" and "Lahore Se Aagey" which would have been his feature film debut, but he had to quit the project because of music tours and concerts he was already committed to.
In early 2019 it was announced that he'll get his first lead role in a movie in "Tich Button", a rom-com co-produced by his wife Urwa Hocane under their joint new production company "Shooting Star Studio". After some delay, the movie was eventually released in 2022.
Other work.
Director.
He turned to direction with the 2018 music video of "O Jaana" from the singer-songwriter Hamza Malik, starring actress Iqra Aziz and featuring musicians Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Sahir Ali Bagga.
Personal life.
Saeed married Urwa Hocane on 16 December 2016, in Lahore, Pakistan. On 6 October 2023, Saeed and Hocane announced their pregnancy through social media. On 3 January 2024, the couple had their first child, a daughter, who was named Jahan Aara Saeed.

Small intensely fluorescent cell

Small intensely fluorescent cells (SIF cells) are the interneurons of the sympathetic ganglia (postganglionic neurons) of the Sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The neurotransmitter for these cells is dopamine. They are a neural crest derivative and share a common sympathoadrenal precursor cell with sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells (adrenal medulla).
Although an autonomic ganglion is the site where preganglionic fibers synapse on postganglionic neurons, the presence of small interneurons has been recognized. These cells exhibit catecholamine fluorescence and are referred to as small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells. In some ganglia, these intemeurons receive preganglionic cholinergic fibers and may modulate ganglionic transmission. In other ganglia, they receive collateral branches and may serve some Integrative function. Many SIF cells contain dopamine, which Is thought to be their transmitter.

God (John Lennon song)

"God" is a song by the English musician John Lennon, from his first post-Beatles solo album, "John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band". The album was released on 11 December 1970 in the United States and the United Kingdom. The song references the Beatles and other cultural phenomenons.
Meaning.
There are three sections in the song.
In the first section, John Lennon describes God as "a concept by which we measure our pain".
In the second, Lennon chants a list of things he does not believe in, ending by stating that he just believes in himself (individuality) and his wife (Yoko). He rejects magic, the "I Ching", the Bible, tarot, Hitler, Jesus, Kennedy, the Buddha, mantra, the "Gita", yoga, kings, Elvis, Zimmerman (Bob Dylan), and his former band (the Beatles).
The final section describes Lennon's change since the break-up of the Beatles. While the Beatles were basically his family throughout the 1960s, he refers to Paul McCartney's 1965 Beatles song "Yesterday", and states that he is no longer the "Dreamweaver" or "The Walrus", but just "John". The final line of the song, "The dream is over", has been seen as declaring the end of the 1960s quest for meaning. "If there is a God", Lennon explained, "we're all it".
Legacy.
The Irish rock band U2 wrote and recorded the song "God Part II" as an answer song to Lennon's "God". Included in U2's 1988 album "Rattle and Hum", "God Part II" reprises the "don't believe in" motif from Lennon's song and its lyrics explicitly reference Lennon's 1970 song "Instant Karma!" and American biographer Albert Goldman, author of the controversial book "The Lives of John Lennon" (1988).
English musician David Bowie, a friend and one-time musical collaborator with Lennon, wrote and recorded the song "Afraid", which was included in his 2002 album "Heathen"; one of the song's lyrics, "I believe in Beatles", is a rejoinder to Lennon singing "I don't believe in Beatles" in "God".
Personnel.

Gypsy jazz

Gypsy jazz (also known as sinti jazz, gypsy swing, jazz manouche or hot club-style jazz) is a musical idiom inspired by the Romani jazz guitarist Jean "Django" Reinhardt (1910–1953), in conjunction with the French jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli (1908–1997), as expressed by their group the Quintette du Hot Club de France. The style has its origins in France and the Manouche clan of Romanis, and has remained popular amongst this clan. Gypsy jazz is often called by the French name "jazz manouche", or alternatively, "manouche jazz" in English-language sources.
Reinhardt was foremost among a group of gypsy guitarists working in Paris from the 1930s to the 1950s. The group included the brothers Baro, Sarane, and Matelo Ferret and Reinhardt's brother Joseph "Nin-Nin" Reinhardt.
The style was popular in France and, via recordings and appearances by the original "Quintette", in other European countries before and immediately after the Second World War. It fell out of favour as the "swing era" came to an end, being replaced in its homeland by bebop, mainstream jazz, and eventually, rock and roll. However, it had a resurgence from the 1970s onwards, among performers and audiences at festivals, etc., in particular the Festival Django Reinhardt which commenced in 1968 at Samois-sur-Seine, France (the location of Reinhardt's last residence) and continues to the present time.
Terminology.
The musical style was first named "jazz tsigane" in the French language, which translates to "gypsy jazz" in English. Some scholars have noted that the name "manouche jazz" began to be used around the late 1990s as a replacement term. The term "gypsy jazz" may be considered offensive, as the word "gypsy" has historically been used as a slur against Romani people.
History.
The origins of gypsy jazz can be traced to the Manouche gypsy Django Reinhardt. After serving his musical "apprenticeship" playing in musette bands with accordionists and accompanying popular singers of the day, he became acquainted with jazz music and began playing it. After hearing ragtime and Dixieland music, Reinhardt listened to Duke Ellington, Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang, and especially Louis Armstrong via the record collection of painter Émile Savitry in Toulon, France, in 1931. After Reinhardt met violinist Stéphane Grappelli, they played dance music at the Hôtel Claridge in Paris, during the summer of 1934. According to an account in a book by Michael Dregni, Grappelli played a chorus, then Reinhardt began to improvise. Sometimes they were accompanied on double bass by Louis Vola, the band's leader, and by Roger Chaput on rhythm guitar. This was the core of Reinhardt's band. The addition of Reinhardt's brother, Joseph, on rhythm guitar made it the Quintette du Hot Club de France.
This lineup, with occasional changes in membership on double bass and rhythm guitar, entered the recording studio later that year. They recorded extensively, until the outbreak of war in 1939 when the Quintette was on tour in England. Reinhardt returned to Paris, while Grappelli remained in London for the duration of the war. After the war, they reunited in London and recorded with an English rhythm section. The days of the "hot club" sound were over, as both men had pursued independent musical paths. Reinhardt had moved to an electric guitar sound influenced by bebop. His sons, Lousson and Babik, played in a style influenced by American jazz.
Following Reinhardt's death in 1953 and into the 1960s, Romani players performed mainly upon amplified instruments in a modern, electric style, though with a European "inflection" in which some traces of Reinhardt's influence remained. However, from the 1970s onwards, a new generation of Romani players were interested in the original, hot club style and repertoire; some, such as the older German violinist and bandleader Schnuckenack Reinhardt, had been playing such music earlier, after Reinhardt's model. From the 1970s on, Romani performers such as Fapy Lafertin, Häns'che Weiss, Boulou Ferré, Raphaël Faÿs, Biréli Lagrène, Wawau Adler and Stochelo Rosenberg performed in this style.
At the instigation of guitarist Diz Disley, Grappelli returned to the hot club style with the support of acoustic guitars and double bass. Grappelli's popularity and public appearances helped to rekindle an interest in gypsy jazz among younger listeners. In the 2010s and 2020s, the gypsy jazz style is once again passed on from one generation to the next in Manouche/Sinti communities, children learning from their relatives at an early age, able to master the basics almost before they can hold a normal-sized guitar in their hands.
What is called "gypsy jazz" today was not always played exclusively by Roma, even in its early days: of the original Quintette, only Django and his brother Joseph were Roma, and Django himself played in a non-Roma jazz context on many occasions. In addition, many later Roma guitarists—including Django's own sons Lousson and Babik—did not generally play gypsy jazz in the hot club style, although they were indeed gypsies who were playing jazz. Likewise, a number of today's gypsy jazz exponents are non-gypsies, in addition to the more well known Roma players. Thus, the term has become attached to the style of the music, rather than the ethnicity of the players. Django himself would not have known the term "Manouche jazz"; the Quintette was simply a popular jazz outfit of the day.
Gypsy Jazz is influenced by African-American music. African Americans brought jazz to Paris.
Instrumentation and lineup.
The Quintette du Hot Club de France initially played acoustically, without a drummer. After 1940, the group often recorded with a drummer. Guitar and violin are still the main solo instruments, although clarinet, saxophone, mandolin, and accordion are sometimes used. The rhythm guitar is played using a distinct percussive technique, "la pompe", which essentially replaces the drums. Most gypsy jazz guitarists, lead and rhythm, play a version of the Selmer-Maccaferri guitar design favored by Reinhardt. Ensembles aim for an acoustic sound even when playing amplified concerts, and informal jam sessions in small venues such as the annual Django Reinhardt festival at Samois-sur-Seine are part of the scene.
Reinhardt and his band used a range of guitar models available in France, but dominant among them was the Selmer guitar designed and signed by Mario Maccaferri; Maccaferri parted company with Selmer in 1933 and later models were just known as "Selmer". These guitars were originally made in two versions, the earliest with a large, D-shaped sound hole, and later models with a smaller, O-shaped sound hole. The later models are considered most suited to lead guitar playing. In the 2010s, designs based on this model were marketed as "gypsy jazz guitars" and are the guitars of choice for most practitioners of the style on account of their responsiveness and particular tonal characteristics.
The double bass is the low-pitched instrument in gypsy jazz. The bass is mostly used for a rhythm section and accompaniment, playing walking basslines, "two-feel" parts where the root and the fifth (or sometimes another chord tone) are played as quarter notes on the first and third beats, respectively, and for ballads, a mix of whole notes and half notes. It is mostly plucked with the fingers, but on some songs, the bow is used, either for staccato roots and fifths in "two-feel" or, on a ballad, for sustained low notes. On some songs, bass players may be given an improvised solo. Some gypsy jazz bass players strike the fingerboard with the fingers between plucked notes, creating a percussive style called slap bass (this is different from the 1970s bass guitar style of the same name).
In Eastern European gypsy music, the rhythm section is most likely covered by one or two cymbaloms, or a cymbalom and/or drums and an acoustic guitar ("ţiitură" in Romanian). A double bass fills out these ensembles.
Techniques.
Rhythm.
In gypsy jazz, the rhythm guitar uses a special form of strumming known as "la pompe", i.e. "the pump". This form of percussive rhythm is similar to the "boom-chick" in bluegrass styles; it is what gives the music its fast swinging feeling, and it most often emphasizes beats two and four, a vital feature of swing. The strumming hand, which never touches the top of the guitar, must make a quick up-down strum followed by a down strum. The up-down part of la pompe must be done extremely fast, regardless of the tempo of the music. It is very similar to a grace note in classical music, albeit with an entire chord is use. This pattern is usually played in unison by two or more guitarists in the rhythm section.
Harmony.
Another aspect of the style is based on the chord shapes Reinhardt was forced to use due to his injury. Standard barre chords are not as common in gypsy jazz. Standard major and minor chords are almost never played, and are replaced by major 7th chords, major 6th chords, and 6/9 chords. Reharmonisation is often aimed at giving a minor feel, even where a song is in a major key; for instance, the substitution of a minor 6th chord for a dominant seventh. Dominant seventh chords are also altered by lowering the 9th and 13th scale degree. Gypsy jazz songs use half-diminished chords to precede dominant seventh chords in minor keys.
Lead.
Lead playing in this style has been summarised as ornamented or decorated arpeggio.
Arpeggios on the guitar are typically executed as patterns running diagonally from the lower frets on the lower strings to the upper frets on the upper strings. Such patterns tend to have no more than two stopped notes per string, relating to the fact that Django could only articulate two fingers on his fretting hand.
Commonly used scales, in addition to arpeggios, include the chromatic scale, melodic minor scale, Dorian mode, and diminished scale.
Chromatic runs are often executed very quickly over more than one octave. A particularly characteristic technique is the glissando, in which the guitar player slides a finger along a string, with a precisely timed tremolo picking out individual notes, in order to get a fast, virtuosic sound. Diminished runs, in which the shape of a diminished seventh chord is played in all inversions, one after the other, is another widespread gypsy jazz technique. Diminished 7th arpeggios are also used over dominant 7th chords. (Example: If an A7 is being played, a diminished run starting on C# would be played, creating an A7b9 sound over the dominant chord.) Guitarists often intersperse melodic playing with flamenco-esque percussive series of chords to create a varied solo.
The plectrum technique of gypsy jazz has been described as similar to economy picking. Notes on the same string are played alternately, but when moving from string to string, the traditional technique is to use a down stroke. For instance, on switching from the G to the B string, the plectrum will move in the same direction and come to rest on the E string. The down stroke is preferred because of volume and tone. While this technique of doubling down strokes varies among players, Stochelo Rosenberg's technique is a prime example.
Repertoire.
Gypsy jazz has its own set of frequently played standards, which are fairly distinct from the standards tunes of mainstream jazz. However, contemporary ensembles may adapt almost any type of song to the style. Swing standards include jazz hits of the 1920s and 1930s, such as "Limehouse Blues" and "Dinah"; Bal Musette numbers, often waltzes; original compositions by Django Reinhardt, such as "Nuages" and "Swing 42"; compositions by other notable gypsy swing players and jazzed-up versions of Romani songs, such as "Dark Eyes". Much of the repertoire is in minor keys, and the dorian and harmonic minor modes are frequently heard, lending a distinctively dark and modal sound to the tunes, contrasting with the up-tempo and spirited performance style. One popular example is Django's tune "Minor Swing", perhaps the most well-known gypsy jazz composition. Slower ballads and duets may feature rubato playing and exotic harmonies.
Teaching and learning.
The first generations of gypsy jazz musicians learned the style by the "gypsy method," involving intense practice, direct imitation of older musicians (often family members) and playing and learning "by ear" with little formal musical study (or, indeed, formal education of any kind). Since the late 1970s, study materials of a more conventional kind such as workshops, etude and method books and videos have become available, allowing musicians worldwide to learn the style and its idiomatic ornaments and musical language. Fake books containing lead sheets with the chord progressions and melodies of gypsy jazz standards have become available as well, both in book form and on websites.
Since the 1990s, software such as Power Tab Editor and Band-in-a-Box files have become available. Prominent gypsy-style guitarists who are not ethnically Roma include John Jorgenson, Andreas Öberg, Frank Vignola and George Cole. Touring gypsy jazz musicians often include workshops with performances. Players who have written study guides include Martin Norgaard, Tim Kliphuis, Andreas Öberg, Ian Cruickshank, Robin Nolan, Denis Chang, Michael Horowitz, Daniel Givone and Patrick "Romane" Leguidcoq.
Contemporary forms.
The largest audiences and highest number of musicians were found in Europe in 2006 as this is where the style originated. Contemporary gypsy jazz musicians include Gonzalo Bergara, George Cole, Angelo Debarre, Pearl Django, John Jorgenson, Tim Kliphuis, Biréli Lagrène, Robin Nolan, Stochelo Rosenberg, Paulus Schäfer, Joscho Stephan, and Frank Vignola.
Australia.
The British guitarist Hank Marvin, who now lives in Perth, Western Australia, has toured and recorded gypsy jazz in a quartet featuring a rhythm guitar, bandoleon, and double bass. There is a gypsy jazz "cell" in St. Kilda, Melbourne, which has performed in parks.
Canada.
In Canada, gypsy jazz bands include Denis Chang, Justin Duhaime's Gypsy Muse, Gypsophilia, Mishra's Dream, The Lost Fingers, Christian Flores (Ottawa), Django Libre and Les Petits Nouveaux. Christine Tassan et les Imposteures is a gypsy jazz band founded in 2003 in Montreal. For several years it was an entirely feminine quartet. It still includes four musicians around lead guitarist and lead singer Christine Tassan.
France.
Contemporary gypsy instrumentalists in the Django Reinhardt and Jazz Hot Tradition, as heard annually at the Festival Django Reinhardt at Samois-sur-Seine, France, include Django's grandson David Reinhardt, Dorado Schmitt, Tchavolo Schmitt, Jon Larsen, Angelo Debarre, Babik Reinhardt, John Jorgenson, Samson Schmitt, Stephane Wrembel, Biréli Lagrène, Rocky Gresset and Florin Niculescu. Former regulars also included the late Mondine Garcia and Didi Duprat. Jazz vocalist Cyrille Aimée has roots based in gypsy jazz. French jazz vocalist Tatiana Eva-Marie performs gypsy-jazz music combined with swing music in Brooklyn, New York.
Germany.
Schnuckenack Reinhardt (17 February 1921 – 15 April 2006) was a German gypsy jazz violinist, composer and interpreter. Häns'che Weiss (1951 – 2 June 2016) was a German gypsy jazz and modern jazz guitarist. Dotschy Reinhardt (born 1975) is a contemporary singer-songwriter in Romani language and innovator of gypsy jazz.
Malta.
Violinist George Curmi l-Puse along with accordionist Yuri Charyguine, guitarists Joshua Bray and Steve Delia d-Delli, and bassist Anthony Saliba l-Fesu created the Hot Club Of Valletta in 2014. They have played gigs in and around Valletta into 2015, sometimes referring to the music they play as jazz manouche.
Nordic countries.
There is a yearly Django festival in Norway and Jon Larsen's Hot Club de Norvège is based there. Gypsy guitarists Andreas Öberg and Gustav Lundgren are based in Sweden. Gypsy guitar builder Ari-Jukka Luomaranta (AJL-Guitars) is based in Finland and runs his own group Hot club de Finlande, performing with soloists from Europe.
Romania.
Gypsy jazz came into prominence in Romania around 1980 by means of the pop-folk subgenre known as "muzică bănăţeană" (i.e. music in the Banat style), still practised to date. It has a different approach to lăutari (gypsy folk) music. In "muzica bănăţeană", some traditional instruments (kobza, cimbalom) are replaced by electric guitars and synthesizers, while others are kept (fiddle, accordion, alto saxophone, taragot), thus creating an eclectic type of sound (beside the unexpected timbre combinations, contrasting textures from these instruments are also featured.) The repertoire mixes together café concert, old-school jazz standards, folk and pop-folk music. The Western gypsy style is reinterpreted mostly through the sârbă rhythm, actually very close to it, but syncopated differently in lead instruments. Throughout the years, "muzica bănăţeană" has gradually become fond of the manea rhythm, which sounds more like the twist when played in the Banat style; however the swung sârbă was not abandoned.
"Muzica bănăţeană" was politically censored throughout the 1980, so that only bootleg recordings survive of those years. According to the Romanian Ministry of Culture, the reason for banning it was its impure nature, threatening the national folk music. However, other lăutari music was widely recorded and performed in Communist Romania. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, numerous musicians who were not previously permitted to record on the national record label Electrecord, saw their debuts released; but that eclectic characteristic of Romanian gypsy music changed into what is now called "manele" – a music that is not entirely from gypsy folk origin, nor is it jazz or another defined genre. There are many manele performers creating hybrid genres mixing different notes and rhythms.
Spain.
Since the 2010s, Gypsy Jazz has been growing very fast in Spain with guitarists as Biel Ballester, Albert Bello and David Regueiro. There is also a yearly Django festival: Festival Django L'H.
United States.
"Django in June" is a weeklong gypsy jazz music camp ("Django Camp"), with weekend clinics and concerts. Inaugurated in 2004, the event is held on the campus of Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts offers a gypsy jazz ensemble instructed by Jason Anick, the leader of the Rhythm Future Quartet. DjangoFest NW is held each September at Whidbey Island Center for the Arts in Langley, Washington, which typically features such performers as John Jorgenson, The Rosenberg Trio, Dan Hicks, and Pearl Django. In conjunction with the first DjangoFest event, Jazz Gitan guitarist Don Price started the first American Gypsy Jazz Guitar Group to facilitate the popularity and spread of this style in the United States. Every year, in August, New York's Lincoln Center holds a concert at Rose Hall, and the jazz club Birdland in New York holds a weeklong gypsy jazz concert series in June and November.
In Minnesota, guitarist and composer Reynold Philipsek performs gypsy jazz as a solo musician and with Minnesota gypsy jazz acts East Side, The Twin Cities Hot Club, and Sidewalk Café. Also in the Twin Cities area, the singer Connie Evingson has recorded three gypsy albums: "Gypsy in My Soul" (2004) with Pearl Django, the Clearwater Hot Club, and Parisota Hot Club, "Stockholm Sweetnin'" (2006) with The Hot Club of Sweden, and "All the Cats Join In" (2014) with the John Jorgenson Quintet. George Cole and his group Vive Le Jazz have been touring nationally, most recently playing at Carnegie Hall in 2008. His gypsy jazz inspired music was chosen for a Grammy's showcase. He plays an original Selmer 520 that Django Reinhardt used on tour in France in the 1940s.
In Brooklyn, New York, musicians from France including vocalist Tatiana Eva-Marie of the Avalon Jazz Band and violinist Adrien Chevalier have been performing a gypsy-jazz mixed with American swing.
New Jersey–based guitarist Frank Vignola is a leading figure of American gypsy-jazz.

High-dimensional model representation

High-dimensional model representation is a expansion for a given "multivariable" function. The expansion was first described by Ilya M. Sobol as
The method, used to determine the right hand side functions, is given in Sobol's paper. A review can be found here: High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR): Concepts and Applications.
The underlying logic behind the HDMR is to express all variable interactions in a system in a hierarchical order. For instance formula_2 represents the mean response of the model formula_3. It can be considered as measuring what is left from the model after stripping down all variable effects. The uni-variate functions formula_4, however represents the "individual" contributions of the variables. For instance, formula_5 is the portion of the model that can be controlled only by the variable formula_6. For this reason, there can not be any constant in formula_5 because all constants are expressed in formula_2. Going further into higher interactions,the next stop is bivariate functions formula_9 which represents the cooperative effect of variables formula_10 and formula_11 together. Similar logic applies here: the bivariate functions do not contain univarite functions nor constants as it violates the construction logic of HDMR. As we go into higher interactions, the number of interactions are increasing and at last we reach the residual term formula_12 representing the contribution only if all variable act together. 
HDMR as an Approximation.
The hierarchical representation model of HDMR brings an advantage if one needs to replace an existing model with a simpler one usually containing only univariate or bivariate terms. If the target model does not contain higher level of variable interactions, this approach can yield good approximations with the additional advantage of providing a clearer view of variable interactions.

Edward L. Cochrane

Vice Admiral Edward Lull "Ned" Cochrane (March 18, 1892 – November 14, 1959) was a United States Navy officer and naval architect who served as Chief of the Bureau of Ships during World War II. In this capacity, he was directly responsible for the Navy's massive shipbuilding and maintenance program from November 1942 until November 1946.
Naval career.
The son of retired Marine Brigadier General Henry Clay Cochrane (1842–1913), Edward Lull Cochrane was born at Mare Island, California in 1892. His family eventually settled in Chester, Pennsylvania. From 1909 to 1910, Cochrane attended the University of Pennsylvania. He entered the United States Naval Academy in 1910 and was commissioned as a Navy ensign upon graduating second of 154 in his class on June 5, 1914. After serving aboard the battleship for two years, Cochrane attended the Naval Postgraduate School in 1916.
During World War I, he served at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and transferred to the Navy's Construction Corps. He graduated in 1920 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with a Master of Science degree in Naval Architecture.
Between the World Wars, Cochrane served in various positions related to shipbuilding, including in the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair, predecessor to the Bureau of Ships. He attended the Naval War College in 1939 and was promoted to captain on July 1, 1940. Cochrane then served as assistant naval attaché at the U.S. Embassy in London.
He assumed the post of Chief, BuShips in November 1942, succeeding Rear Admiral Alexander H. Van Keuren. From January 1941 until assuming command of the bureau, Cochrane served as the Assistant Head of the Design Division. He was promoted to rear admiral effective November 1, 1942 and then to vice admiral on April 3, 1945. From 1946 to 1947, Cochrane served as Chief of the Material Division, Department of the Navy.
Academic career.
Cochrane retired from the navy in 1947, while serving as a member of the President's Advisory Committee on the Merchant Marine. He then joined the faculty of MIT, serving from 1947 to 1950 as head of the Department of Ocean Engineering (originally known as the Department of Naval Architecture), and from 1952 to 1954 as head of the School of Engineering.
From 1950 to 1952, Cochrane interrupted his academic career to serve as chairman of the Federal Maritime Board and head of the Maritime Administration for President Harry S. Truman.
Last years and legacy.
Vice Admiral Cochrane died in New Haven, Connecticut, on November 14, 1959, at the age of 67. After attending a meeting of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers in New York City, he suffered a heart attack during his train ride back to Boston and was taken to Grace–New Haven Hospital for treatment. Cochrane was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.
Many of Vice Admiral Cochrane's papers are held at the Naval Historical Center at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. The papers include documents pertaining to the reorganization of the Bureau of Ships during World War II as well as transcripts of official speeches given by Admiral Cochrane during his term as head of that Bureau. Additionally, there are many personal papers and photographs relating to the Admiral's close association with civilian Naval Architecture and engineering organizations.
A small amount of related papers, focusing on his student years at MIT, are also available at the MIT Institute Archives and Special Collections.
Awards and honors.
Cochrane received many awards and honors for his contributions to naval architecture, including the David W. Taylor Medal, and more generally to the field of engineering. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1953 received honorary membership in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).
Cochrane was also awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, and was an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.
Cochrane was conferred an honorary LL.D. degree by Hahnemann Medical College in 1943, an honorary Ed.D. degree by the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1946, an honorary Sc.D. degree by Tufts College in 1950 and a second honorary Ed.D. degree by the Stevens Institute of Technology in 1954.
MIT's Admiral Edward L. Cochrane Award is presented each year to an outstanding student athlete. The award goes to a male senior for demonstrating humility, leadership and inspiration in intercollegiate sports.
The , a "Charles F. Adams"-class guided missile armed destroyer, was named in his honor.
Admiral Cochrane Drive in Annapolis was named in his honor. His two sons, Richard Lull Cochrane (March 7, 1917 – January 9, 1997) and Edward Lull Cochrane Jr. (July 17, 1922 – December 19, 2024), were also Naval Academy graduates who retired as Navy captains.

Rot-Front

Rot-Front (Russian Рот-Фронт) is a settlement 60 kilometres east of Bishkek in the Chüy Region of Kyrgyzstan, near the border of Kazakhstan. Its population was 968 in 2021. Originally settled by Germans, a significant minority remains. It was founded as Bergtal (also sometimes spelt Bergthal) and renamed Rot-Front in 1927.
History.
At the end of the 19th century, German-speaking settlers from the Russian Empire moved to Central Asia to obtain new lands. Most these settlers were Mennonites. The village of Bergtal, one of several originally German settlements in Kyrgyzstan, was established on the very rich black soil of the Chüy Valley, at the foot of the Tian Shan mountains, by Baptist and Mennonite families who had emigrated from East Frisia some three hundred years earlier to escape forced military service. At the end of the 19th century many moved to central Asia from the Volga and Crimea.
In the first year of settlement, 41 simlins (earth dwellings) made of mud bricks with thatched roofs were built along the village street, which were about 2 metres deep into the ground and about 80 centimetres above the surface.
The first school teachers gave their lessons in German in private homes. Even after the village school was built, German was still the language of instruction until 1938; after that, only Russian was allowed to be taught and pupils were forbidden to speak German.
In 1931, the kolkhoz Ragaduga was also formed in "Bergtal" together with Grünfeld and with the Stalinization of the Soviet Union the village was renamed "Rot-Front" in 1936 after the separation of the kolkhoz.
During the Second World War, the Bergtalers suffered the same fate as all ethnic Germans in the Soviet Union. They were not deported, they already lived in a region to which others were deported, but the ethnic Germans of Rotfront were subject to much suspicion and discrimination and more than a third of the men conscripted died in the forced labour of the "Trudarmee". Women were also sent for forced labour. Many children were left without parents and without care. Parallel to the forced labour, other minorities from the Caucasus were forcibly resettled in the Red Front.
After the war, the life of the inhabitants and the economy of the village were slow to recover. It was not until the 1960s and 1970s that things began to pick up again; the Germans were also slowly able to come together again for church services. As the majority of the inhabitants still had relatives in Germany, it was possible to apply for resettlement to Germany from the 1980s onwards. From 1986, when perestroika was announced under Mikhail Gorbachev, until the collapse of the Soviet Union, the vast majority of residents had applied for resettlement to Germany. Due to the collapse of the agricultural collective farms after 1991, many residents lost their jobs. The Kyrgyz language was introduced as the state language. By 1992, more than half of the former 900 German residents of "Rot-Front" had moved to Germany. After the co-operative founded in the 1990s went bankrupt in 2010 and many villagers lost their jobs, there was another wave of emigration of German families and around half of the remaining Germans emigrated to Germany. Today, only around 150 ethnic Germans still live in the village. However, "Rot-Front/Bergtal" is one of the few villages in Central Asia where a significant German minority still lives. Almost all of them have relatives in Germany, visit each other and have permission to travel to Germany.
Today.
After Kyrgyzstan's independence in 1991, arising from the collapse of the Soviet Union, the remaining German residents received permission to display the village's original name, Bergtal, on their road signs, underneath the official designation of "Rotfront". A small museum in the school house, established with financial support from the German government, displays letters and photographs recounting the migration of the villagers' ancestors to Kyrgyzstan and their past life in the village. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the German government has also provided a German teacher for the community. Generous financial and material aid from the German government for the local agricultural cooperative has, however, for the most part been wasted or misused.
In 1995 a film was made entitled "Milch und Honig aus Rotfront" ("Milk and Honey from Rotfront"), depicting the life of the German residents of Bergtal.
Today, Bergtal/Rotfront has the second largest community of people of German background in central Asia, although a majority of the population of the village is now of Kyrgyz descent. It is believed to be the only remaining village in central Asia with a substantial German minority.
Many of the houses of the former inhabitants of German origin were bought by Kyrgyz and there is no longer a strict separation between the Christian Germans and Muslim Kyrgyz. Lessons in the village are also no longer held in German, but in Russian and Kyrgyz.

Gurmukh

Gurmukh (Punjabi: ਗੁਰਮੁਖ) is a term used within the religion of Sikhism to mean "coming from the persona of the guru", or "to be in the character or personality of the guru", and implies to be God-centred.
The higher spiritual meaning is of one who has met the guru within, in meditation, and remains in the will of the guru or attempts to follow the guru's teachings wholeheartedly. In daily life, it describes one who is living a wholesome life in support of the spirit, as instructed by the guru.
The word "gurmukh" is found frequently throughout Gurbani, which are Sikh compositions.
In contrast, a "manmukh" is one who follows the dictates of the mind—indulging in the senses, animal behaviours, greed, corruption, and the base desires of the mind.

Maryland Terrapins football

The Maryland Terrapins football team represents the University of Maryland, College Park in the sport of American football. The Terrapins compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Big Ten Conference. The Terrapins joined the Big Ten Conference on July 1, 2014, following 62 years in the Atlantic Coast Conference as a founding member. Mike Locksley is the head coach of the Terrapins.
Since 1950, the Terrapins have played their home games at SECU Stadium in College Park, Maryland, with occasional home games from time to time in Baltimore, making them one of two FBS football teams in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area (Navy Midshipmen) and the closest Football Bowl Subdivision team to Washington, D.C. The team's official colors of red, white, black, and gold have been in use in some combination since the 1920s and are taken from Maryland's state flag. The Terrapins nickname — often abbreviated as "Terps" — was adopted in 1933 after the diamondback terrapin, a turtle species native to the state. Maryland shares storied rivalries with Virginia and West Virginia.
The program's achievements have included one national championship in 1953, nine ACC championships, two Southern Conference championships, 12 consensus All-Americans, several Hall of Fame inductees, and 28 bowl game appearances. Maryland possesses the third-most ACC championships with nine, which places them behind Clemson and Florida State with 15 each. Many former Terrapins players and coaches have gone on to careers in professional football including 17 first-round NFL Draft picks.
History.
Early years (1892–1946).
In 1892, the school then known as the Maryland Agricultural College fielded its first officially-sanctioned college football team. They went scoreless in all three of that season's games, but the following year, posted a perfect record of 6–0. For the first two decades of the program, the team primarily competed against local universities and high schools due to the prohibitive nature of long-distance travel at the time.
In 1911, Harry C. "Curley" Byrd became head coach and held that position for more than two decades until he was named the university president. In 1921, Maryland joined the Southern Conference where it remained for thirty years. Between 1935 and 1946, the school had several coaches that achieved fame elsewhere: Frank Dobson, a former assistant coach under John Heisman; Clark Shaughnessy, architect of Stanford's undefeated 1940 turnaround; and Paul "Bear" Bryant, who later became the long-time Alabama head coach. Bryant resigned after one season when a player he had suspended was reinstated by President Byrd.
Jim Tatum era (1947–1955).
Jim Tatum was hired in 1947, after a brief stint at Oklahoma where he had led the Sooners to a conference championship in his only season there. He was Maryland's sixth head coach in eight years, but Tatum stayed for nine seasons and became the school's most successful head coach in modern history. During his tenure, he led Maryland to two national championships (one retroactive), three conference championships, three perfect seasons, six top-20 final rankings, and five bowl game appearances. Seven of his players were named first-team All-Americans, including five consensus All-Americans. Under Tatum, Maryland finished every season with a winning record.
After the 1947 season, the Terrapins participated in their first bowl game, the 1948 Gator Bowl, in which they tied Georgia, 20–20. NCAA season-scoring leader Lu Gambino recorded all three Maryland touchdowns. In 1949, Maryland again played in the Gator Bowl, where they defeated 20th-ranked Missouri, 20–7. The Terrapins finished the season ranked 14th by the Associated Press. Maryland's current home field, Byrd Stadium, was constructed in 1950, and named in honor of former coach and contemporary Maryland president Curly Byrd. Maryland started the 1950 season ranked 15th and defeated Navy, 35–21, in the Byrd Stadium dedication game.
The Terrapins won the 1951 Southern Conference co-championship alongside the Virginia Military Institute. Their perfect season culminated with an upset over first-ranked Tennessee in the . At the time, however, the wire services released their final rankings before the bowl games, and Maryland finished third in the Associated Press Poll. Several selectors, including analyst Jeff Sagarin, have retroactively credited Maryland with the national championship. In 1953, Maryland and six other schools split from the Southern Conference to form the Atlantic Coast Conference. That year, Maryland shut-out two 11th-ranked teams: Mississippi, 38–0, and Alabama, 21–0, won the ACC co-championship alongside Duke, and were named the national champions as the only undefeated and untied team in the nation. The Terrapins were defeated by fourth-ranked Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. After the 1955 season, Tatum resigned to return to North Carolina, where he soon died of Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
After Tatum (1956–1971).
The Terrapins entered 1956 ranked number-six, but after the departure of Tatum, they suffered their first losing season in a decade. It marked the beginning of a long undistinguished period of Maryland history, and between 1956 and 1971, they compiled a record of 50–100–1 and only three winning seasons. In 1967, they suffered their first and only winless season in 75 years. High points during this period included victories over 14th-ranked North Carolina in 1957, 21–7, in which Queen Elizabeth II was in attendance for her first American Football game while she was in Washington. 11th-ranked Clemson in 1959, eighth-ranked in 1960, and seventh-ranked Syracuse in 1961. In 1962, assistant coach Lee Corso convinced African-American wide receiver Darryl Hill to transfer from the Naval Academy. Hill broke the color barrier in football at four institutions: Gonzaga High School, the Naval Academy, Maryland, and the ACC. In 1965, back Bob Sullivan led the nation with 10 interceptions.
Jerry Claiborne era (1972–1981).
In 1972, Jerry Claiborne took over as head coach of the Terrapins, which had only nine wins in the past five years. In his first season, Maryland improved to 5–5–1, and the following year, they reached their first bowl game in almost two decades. The team steadily improved until his fifth season, 1976, when they finished the regular season with an 11–0 record, their first perfect mark since Tatum's 1955 squad. Boomer Esiason later described Claiborne's coaching style as "vanilla", and said his strategy was "run right, run left, run up the middle, punt, and play good defense." He went on to say, "But, there's no question he made me a tougher player . . . We'd do drills where the quarterback had to take on a linebacker. It was like he had a sign on our back, 'Hit us, we're stupid'. It made you a tougher player."
In 1974, Maryland had a pre-season rank of 14th and later beat 17th-ranked NC State to win the ACC championship. The Terrapins were defeated by 20th-ranked Tennessee in the Liberty Bowl and finished the season ranked 13th. In 1975, Maryland again won the ACC and defeated 13th-ranked Florida in the to finish 13th in the nation. That season, the Terrapins led the ACC in total offense with 375.2 yards per game. Maryland started 1976 ranked 12th, and quarterback Mark Manges led them to 11 consecutive wins to secure their third straight ACC championship. Maryland's loss to sixth-ranked Houston in the , 30–21, ended any hopes for a national championship.
In 1978, Maryland beat 20th-ranked NC State and finished with a ranking of 20th. The game that pitted 11th-ranked Maryland against 12th-ranked Clemson has been described as one of the most exciting games of the era. The "big-play caravan" ultimately saw Clemson triumph, 28–24. From 1974 to 1978, Claiborne and the Terrapins secured five consecutive bowl game berths and three consecutive ACC championships. Maryland made it to a sixth bowl game in 1980. After the 1981 season, Claiborne left the program for his alma mater, Kentucky, and was replaced by Bobby Ross, an assistant coach for the Kansas City Chiefs.
Bobby Ross era (1982–1986).
In a surprising choice, former Maryland assistant coach and Citadel head coach Bobby Ross, who was not a big-name at the time, was selected as head coach in 1982. In contrast to Claiborne's style, Ross implemented a high-powered offense. He replaced the I-veer triple option with an NFL-style offense that emphasized dropback passes, bootlegs, and play action passes. This change in tactics and strategy enabled starting quarterback Boomer Esiason the opportunity to excel to a degree not seen under Claiborne the season prior. Esiason said, "Ross has an uncanny knack of putting players in a position to not only succeed, but to overachieve . . . If he didn't show up at Maryland, I don't know what would have happened to me. I don't know if I would have turned into the player I was and played in the NFL." During this time, several Maryland quarterbacks went on to careers in the National Football League (NFL), and the school was nicknamed "Quarterback U" as a result.
In Ross's inaugural season, Maryland defeated 10th-ranked North Carolina in Chapel Hill, and then edged Miami before their most important conference game of the season against the 1981 national champions, the Clemson Tigers. Between 1974 and 1988, either Clemson or Maryland won the ACC title all but three years. Clemson had lost to the 1980 national champions, seventh-ranked Georgia, 13–7, and tied Boston College, 17–17, after the opposing quarterback, Doug Flutie, led a comeback. Clemson was therefore unable to defend their NCAA championship, but either Clemson or Maryland, with perfect conference records, would secure the ACC title. Thus, decades before the official ACC Championship Game, 1982 saw a rare "de facto" title match. Clemson scored first, then pulled away 14–7 before half. In the second half, a favorable wind twice yielded Maryland excellent field position, Esiason threw for two rapid-fire touchdowns and a two-point conversion, and the defense held Clemson at bay. However, the Terrapins also turned the ball over five times in the second half and lost, 24–22. With the win, Clemson won the ACC and Maryland finished second. Immediately after the game, the NCAA announced its investigation into Clemson recruiting had found improprieties. As a result, the Tigers were denied a bowl game and television coverage in the following season. The ACC instituted further punishment, making Clemson ineligible for the conference championship for the next two years. Maryland finished 1982 ranked 20th after losing to ninth-ranked Washington in the . In 1983, Maryland lost to third-ranked Auburn and 20th-ranked West Virginia, but beat 17th-ranked Pittsburgh and third-ranked North Carolina. Clemson and Maryland once more met with perfect ACC records, and Maryland again lost, this time blown out, 52–27. Despite the loss, Maryland was awarded the conference championship because of the sanctions against Clemson.
In 1984, Maryland defeated the defending national champions, sixth-ranked Miami, in what was then the biggest comeback in college football history and judged by some as the most exciting. At half time, Maryland trailed Miami, 31–0. Back-up quarterback Frank Reich replaced Stan Gelbaugh and proceeded to throw four touchdown passes, and capitalizing on Miami errors, the Terrapins won, 42–40. The recovery from the 31–point halftime deficit stood as the greatest college football comeback for the next 22 years, until the record was finally broken by Michigan State against Northwestern. Reich later repeated the feat in his professional career when he led the Buffalo Bills to overcome a 32-point deficit and set the NFL comeback record. That season, Maryland also defeated 17th-ranked West Virginia in Morgantown and 20th-ranked Clemson at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore to avenge the 1983 loss at Death Valley, and secured the 1984 ACC Championship with a 45–34 victory over arch rival Virginia in Charlottesville. In the postseason, they edged Tennessee, 28–27, in the and finished 12th in the nation. Maryland entered the 1985 season with a number-one preseason rank, and set its all-time home attendance record in Byrd Stadium with an average of 49,385 over five games. However, they dropped to a ranking of 17th in Week 2, and then out of the polls in Week 4 after a shutout by Michigan. Despite the early setbacks, the Terrapins finished undefeated in six conference games to take the ACC championship for the third consecutive year. Maryland defeated Syracuse, 35–18, in the Cherry Bowl and earned a final ranking of 18th. In 1986, the Terrapins may have posted a mediocre 5–5–1 record, one of the five losses was to the eventual 1986 National Champion Penn State by 2 points in State College due to a failed 2-point conversion that would have tied the game at 17, and the lone game that ended in a tie was against eventual ACC Champion Clemson at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore.
After the season, Ross resigned as head coach. He expressed frustration over the university's failure to improve Byrd Stadium and its associated facilities. Ross had shown recruits stadium and facility renovation plans as an indication of the program's direction, and when they did not come to fruition, he felt that he had misled the players. Ross also stated that he was hurt by "innuendo, insinuation, and guilt by association" with respect to the cocaine-induced death of Maryland basketball star Len Bias. He said, "I feel the football team has represented the university well, both on and off the field." The athletics department investigation report had commended the propriety of the football program, but university chancellor John B. Slaughter did not offer his vocal support for Ross until a month later.
Dark years (1987–2000).
Maryland athletics in general were marred by the death of Len Bias, and the football team was no exception. After Ross resigned, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Joe Krivak was promoted to head coach. This was the beginning of a lackluster period for Terrapins football, and Maryland compiled a 55–88 record and one bowl appearance from 1987 to 2000. A controversial loss to Virginia in the final game of 1988 cost the team a sixth win for bowl eligibility. In 1989, Maryland tied Joe Paterno's 13th-ranked Penn State for the only time in the series' existence. The following season, the Terrapins beat 25th-ranked West Virginia and upset 8th-ranked Virginia. Maryland received a bowl berth and tied Louisiana Tech in the , which would be their only postseason appearance during this period. Maryland was plagued by injuries in 1991, and finished with just two wins to nine losses, their worst record in two decades.
After that season, athletic director Andy Geiger fired Krivak, one year after having granted him a five-year contract extension, and hired Holy Cross head coach Mark Duffner as his replacement. Duffner installed a run and shoot offense which shattered many school records, but the defense was notoriously weak. During this time, quarterbacks Scott Milanovich and John Kaleo set numerous school records for passing under Duffner, most of which still stand. In 1993, Maryland earned the dubious honor of most yards allowed per game, a record which still stands. In 11 games, the Terrapins surrendered 6,083 yards—an average of 553.0 yards per game. After that season, Duffner reorganized his staff by firing three assistant coaches, but the team showed little progress in the following years. Duffner was fired after the 1996 season, having accumulated a combined record of 20–35.
Ron Vanderlinden was hired as head coach for the 1997 season under a five-year contract. Vanderlinden had helped engineer turnarounds at Northwestern as defensive coordinator and at Colorado as a defensive assistant. The 1995 Northwestern team in particular had shocked observers when it recorded a 10–2 season and the Big Ten championship. In 1999, Maryland showed its first signs of significant improvement, and a winning season appeared certain when Maryland possessed a 5–2 record. The Terrapins, however, then suffered a three-game losing streak. In their finale against Virginia, the Terrapins needed a win to garner a likely invitation to either the Aloha Bowl or Oahu Bowl, whose chief executive officer was a Maryland alumnus. The Terrapins came from behind and held the lead, 30–27, with 5:18 left to play. They regained possession with 1:40 remaining, but an inexperienced quarterback unintentionally stopped the clock. Virginia recovered the ball on downs and mounted a touchdown drive to win the game and end Maryland's bowl hopes. Despite narrowly missing a winning season, Vanderlinden was granted a two-year contract extension. In 2000, Maryland again fell short of a winning season and bowl game. The Terrapins entered their season closer with a 5–5 record, and again fell, this time in a rout by 24th-ranked Georgia Tech. Vanderlinden was fired the following day.
Despite the failure to deliver a winning season, Vanderlinden did oversee substantive improvement in the program. In 1999, Maryland allowed a conference low of 11 sacks compared with 56 two years prior, and they led the conference in rushing after being ranked last in 1997. In 1998, the Terrapins were one of the most improved teams in defense, scoring defense, passing defense, and rushing. During Vanderlinden's tenure, Maryland also recruited several key players who were instrumental in the team's later success.
Ralph Friedgen era (2001–2010).
Ralph Friedgen, a former Maryland player and assistant under Bobby Ross, was hired as Vanderlinden's replacement for the 2001 season. Friedgen had previously been denied an interview for the position twice by his alma mater. While offensive coordinator at Georgia Tech, he had been described as an "offensive genius", and Friedgen later received similar plaudits while at Maryland. When he took over, Maryland had not won a bowl game in 16 years and had only one winning season since 1990.
In 2001, Maryland won its first four games and entered the AP Poll for the first time since September 1995. Maryland beat 15th-ranked Georgia Tech in overtime when placekicker Nick Novak, the ACC's future all-time scoring leader, equalized and then won the game with 46- and 26-yard field goals, thereby ensuring a winning season and bowl appearance. In Tallahassee, 18th-ranked Florida State broke a stalemate in the fourth quarter to hand Maryland its only defeat of the regular season, 52–31. Maryland closed the year with a win over NC State, which secured the ACC championship and made the Terrapins the first team other than Florida State to take the title outright since the Seminoles joined the conference in 1991. Sixth-ranked Maryland then faced fifth-ranked Florida in the Orange Bowl—their first-ever BCS appearance, and their first major bowl of any sort since the 1977 Cotton Bowl. The Terrapins lost, 56–23, and finished with a 10–2 record and ranked 10th in the nation.
In 2002, Maryland had a preseason rank of 20th, but their first three games included a shutout by 12th-ranked Notre Dame, 22–0, and a loss to 16th-ranked Florida State, 37–10. The Terrapins rallied to defeat 13th-ranked West Virginia and 17th-ranked NC State, while losing only to Virginia. That loss, however, prevented Maryland from earning a share of the ACC championship alongside Florida State. The Terrapins routed Tennessee in the Peach Bowl, 30–3, and finished with an 11–3 record and final ranking of 18th. Maryland began the 2003 season with losses to Northern Illinois and eighth-ranked Florida State. They later defeated 23rd-ranked West Virginia, but were edged by Georgia Tech. In the postseason, 24th-ranked Maryland delivered a second crushing defeat against 20th-ranked West Virginia in the Gator Bowl, 41–7, and finished the season ranked 17th. "The New York Times" computer poll ranked Maryland third in the nation, behind only split-national champions Louisiana State and Southern California. The 2004 season was Friedgen's first with a losing record. Maryland finished with a 5–6 mark that included an overtime loss to West Virginia, 19–16. The highlight of the season was an upset victory over fifth-ranked Florida State, which was Maryland's first against the Seminoles and their first win against a top-10 team since 1990 and the first win over a top-10 team at home since 1983. The Terrapins again ended the 2005 season with a 5–6 record. That season opened with a victory over Navy, which was the first meeting between the intrastate foes in 40 years.
In 2006, Maryland returned to a bowl game and finished with a 9–4 record. During the season, the Terrapins upset 19th-ranked Clemson, 13–12, and five of their games were won by four points or less. In the Champs Sports Bowl, Maryland beat Purdue, 24–7. In 2007, Maryland overcame extensive injuries to again secure a postseason appearance. During the season, unranked Maryland tallied two shocking upsets against 10th-ranked Rutgers, 34–24, and eighth-ranked Boston College, 42–35. They finished the season with a rout of [[2007 NC State Wolfpack football team|NC State] to attain bowl eligibility, 37–0, but lost to [[2007 Oregon State Beavers football team|Oregon State]] in the [[2007 Emerald Bowl|Emerald Bowl]], 21–14. According to the final [[Jeff Sagarin|Sagarin]] computer-generated rankings, Maryland had the second-hardest schedule in the ACC and the 27th-hardest schedule among [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] teams.
Numerous observers described Maryland's [[2008 Maryland Terrapins football team|2008 season]] as "wildly inconsistent". The Terrapins defeated four of their five ranked opponents—25th-ranked [[2008 California Golden Bears football team|California]], 19th-ranked [[2008 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], 19th-ranked [[2008 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team|Wake Forest]], and 17th-ranked [[2008 North Carolina Tar Heels football team|North Carolina]]—but also lost to heavy underdogs [[2008 Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football team|Middle Tennessee]] and [[2008 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia]]. Ultimately, Maryland defeated [[2008 Nevada Wolf Pack football team|Nevada]] in the [[2008 Humanitarian Bowl|Humanitarian Bowl]] and finished the season with an 8–5 record. Before the [[2009 Maryland Terrapins football team|2009 season]], many analysts projected the Terrapins to finish last or second-to-last in the Atlantic Division of the ACC, and expressed particular concern with the inexperienced [[offensive line]]. The prognostications proved accurate, and Maryland finished 2–10 for their first ten-loss season in program history. Maryland rebounded in [[2010 Maryland Terrapins football team|2010]] to finish with a 9–4 record, including a win in the [[2010 Military Bowl|Military Bowl]], and ranked 23rd in the AP Poll. The ACC named Friedgen [[Atlantic Coast Conference football honors|Coach of the Year]], while freshman quarterback [[Danny O'Brien (American football)|Danny O'Brien]] became the first Terrapin ever named [[Atlantic Coast Conference football honors|ACC Rookie of the Year]]. Citing lack of fan support, the athletic department bought out the final year of Friedgen's contract for $2 million.
Randy Edsall era (2011–2015).
[[File:Maryland Football Coach Randy Edsall.jpg|145 px|thumb|Coach Edsall]]
After Friedgen was let go, the Terrapins hired [[Randy Edsall]] away from [[Connecticut Huskies football|Connecticut]] to be Maryland's head coach. The 2011 season was not a successful one for Maryland. Also for the 2011 season, Edsall removed the players' Surnames from the back of their jerseys for the first time since the late 1970's and continued Coach Friedgen's Homecoming tradition of wearing the regular Red home jerseys and Red pants. After a nationally televised win over [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]], the Terrapins struggled for the remainder of the season. They only managed to record one more win (against FCS opponent [[Towson Tigers football|Towson]]) and finished with a 2–10 record and 1-7 record in Atlantic Coast Conference play. The team did attract national attention for its "Maryland Pride" uniforms that were created by [[Under Armour]], who had become the official outfitter of the Maryland Athletic Department in September 2008.
After the 2011 season, Edsall fired both his offensive coordinator [[Gary Crowton]] and his defensive coordinator Todd Bradford. [[Mike Locksley]], who had been fired in 2011 from his head coaching position at [[New Mexico Lobos football|New Mexico]], was hired to be the new offensive coordinator. Locksley had previously worked at Maryland under head coaches Vanderlinden and Friedgen, and was the recruiting coordinator for Maryland before and during the three consecutive 10+ win seasons under Friedgen. [[Brian Stewart (American football)|Brian Stewart]], who had been the defensive coordinator for the [[Houston Cougars football|Houston Cougars]], was hired to replace Bradford as the new defensive coordinator.
Edsall's 2012 team compiled a 4–8 overall record and 2-6 record in conference play, losing four quarterbacks to injury, and eventually starting a linebacker at the position. In 2012, the Terps revamped their regular uniforms as Coach Edsall returned the players' Surnames to the back of the Jerseys and debuted 3 new variations of the "Maryland Pride" uniforms, a gray and white version called "White Ops" worn on the road, a all-black combination called "Black Ops" worn at home and a new variation of the Maryland Pride uniforms. The team's record improved from 2011 nonetheless but still not as much as fans, alumni and the administration had hoped.
The 2013 Maryland Terrapins football team under head coach Edsall improved to 7–6, capping the season with a loss in the [[2013 Military Bowl|Military Bowl]] to [[Marshall Thundering Herd football|Marshall]], The 61st and final season the Terrapins would be playing football in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].
Edsall's 2014 Terps finished their regular season with a 7–5 record, comprising a 4–4 record in Big Ten Conference play that put them third in the Big Ten East Division, their Inaugural season in the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Maryland ended its season at the [[2014 Foster Farms Bowl|Foster Farms Bowl]], where it lost to [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]].
On October 11, 2015, Edsall was relieved of his duties with offensive coordinator [[Mike Locksley]] named as the interim head coach for the rest of the 2015 season.
D. J. Durkin era (2016–2018).
[[File:Governor Visits University of Maryland Football Team (36114499493).jpg|thumb|right|L–R: Unnamed official, Maryland Gov. [[Larry Hogan|Hogan]], [[D. J. Durkin|Durkin]], UofM Pres. [[Wallace Loh|Loh]], and AD [[Kevin Anderson (athletic director)|Anderson]] during Hogan's visit in 2017, photographed by Tom Nappi at [[Cole Field House]].]]
On December 2, 2015, the Terps announced the hiring of former Michigan defensive coordinator [[D. J. Durkin]] as head coach. Durkin had never before worked as a full-time head coach, though he coached the Florida Gators on an interim basis in the [[2015 Birmingham Bowl (January)|2015 Birmingham Bowl]].
In 2016, Durkin coached the Terrapins to a 6–7 record including a bowl loss. Maryland finished 4-8 and was ineligible for a bowl game in 2017. During the 2018 offseason, football player [[Jordan McNair]] died from an apparent [[heat stroke]] after a practice. Following McNair's death and news reports that players "faced abuse and disparagement" from football staff, Durkin was placed on administrative leave on August 11, just weeks before the start of the 2018 season. One of those football staffers Rick Court, one of Durkin's first hires and the strength and conditioning coach, was dismissed from Maryland due to sources describing his abusive training methods. Offensive coordinator [[Matt Canada]], in his first season with Maryland, was named interim head coach. The UM Board of Regents recommended that Durkin stay as head coach after a report was released. However, due to intense backlash Durkin was fired as head coach on October 31, 2018.
Mike Locksley era (2019–present).
On December 4, 2018, Maryland hired Alabama offensive coordinator [[Mike Locksley]] as their new head coach. Locksley, a [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] native and former Maryland assistant, previously served as interim head coach of the Terrapins for their final 6 games in 2015 after Randy Edsall's firing. Locksley is known for his impressive recruiting ability, and has made an effort to keep many of them talented players that go to high school in the [[Washington metropolitan area|DMV]] in the area by convincing them to come to UMD.
The Locksley era at Maryland had an impressive offensive start with the Terps scoring 142 points in the 2019 campaign. In its first game, Maryland defeated [[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]] [[Howard University]] 79-0 and then dominated 21st ranked [[Syracuse University]] 63-20. The 142 points in its first two games marked the Terps highest-ever scoring output in consecutive games. The 63 points against Syracuse were the most points scored against a ranked opponent by any Maryland football team ever. Despite the excitement surrounding the undefeated and 21st ranked team in the country, the Terrapins suffered a disappointing loss to the unranked [[Temple Owls football|Temple Owls]]. After a strong start, the only other win in the season came against Rutgers, and the Terrapins would ultimately finish 3-9. In 2020, the Terps played in a shortened season due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] playing only 5 games, all against teams from the Big Ten, finishing with an overall record of 2-3 and briefly paused operations in the middle of the season due to several players and staff getting diagnosed with symptoms of the virus. The two victories came against Minnesota at home in College Park on Friday, October 30th and on the road in State College, Pennsylvania against Penn State on November 7th.
In 2023, The Terrapins again won 8 games, jumping out to a 5 and 0 record before losing 4 straight, including a close loss to #1 Michigan. In the final regular season game against Rutgers, Maryland's quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa threw for 298 yards in the first half of the game, becoming the Big Ten's all time passing leader. Maryland capped the season with a dominant 31 to 13 win against Auburn, jumping out to a 21 to 0 lead in the first quarter, with the season's backup quarterbacks playing as Taulia Tagovailoa sat the game out.

Home stadium.

During its first few decades, the football program had only one poorly suited athletic field on which to play and practice and had no dedicated facilities such as locker rooms. Former coach and contemporary university president Dr. Harry C. Byrd allocated funds for the construction of a stadium in 1915, and it was completed in 1923. The Board of Regents voted to name it [[Old Byrd Stadium|Byrd Stadium]] in honor of its main advocate. The stadium's capacity was 5,000. During this time, it was common for Maryland to play its better-drawing games in larger stadiums in Washington, D.C., or [[Baltimore]].
In 1950, that small field was replaced by the identically named but much larger [[Byrd Stadium]], which was constructed at the cost of $1 million. The new stadium had an initial capacity of 34,680, which has since been upgraded to 51,055 through extensive additions. Shortly after its construction, the stadium hosted its dedication game against [[1950 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]], which Maryland won 35–21. That same year, the new field held its first and only bowl game, the [[Presidential Cup Bowl]], which featured [[1950 Texas A&amp;M Aggies football team|Texas A&amp;M]] and [[1950 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]]. In 2006, the University of Maryland became the first school to sell naming rights to its field. The home field was officially branded "Chevy Chase Bank Field at Byrd Stadium" in a 25-year, $20 million contract. In 2008, [[Chevy Chase Bank]] was bought out by [[Capital One]], and the stadium was renamed Capital One Field at Byrd Stadium. On December 11, 2015, the Board of Regents voted 12–5 to remove the "Byrd" from the stadium's name because of Harry "Curley" Byrd's segregationist history, renaming it Maryland Stadium for the time being.
Practice facility.
The Maryland Terrapins football team practices in Jones-Hill House, the indoor practice complex and football operations center that opened in August 2017. The facility features a [[Football field (unit of length)|full-length]], 100-yard-long [[FieldTurf]] [[American football field|football field]] with a goal post at each end surrounded by an elevated concourse. With a nearly height clearance from the field to the center of the roof, the facility ranks among the highest [[vertical clearance|headrooms]] in any [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] practice facility. When completed in 2019, the facility will include two full-length outdoor football practice fields, locker rooms, a strength and conditioning center, [[hydrotherapy]] and other training facilities, a theater-style team meeting room, position meeting rooms, a 230-seat cafeteria, and staff offices for the school's football program. A tunnel will connect the Jones-Hill House to [[SECU Stadium]].
Traditions.
Nickname.
[[File:Diamantschildkröte 2008-11-02 223.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[diamondback terrapin]] is a turtle species native to Maryland.]]
When the school was known as the Maryland Agricultural College, from 1856 to 1916, the media called the athletics teams the "Farmers" and the "Aggies". As the University of Maryland, the teams became known as "The Old Liners" in reference to the [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]]. During the 1923 season, "[[The New York Times]]" referred to Maryland as the Orioles, after [[Baltimore oriole|a bird species]] endemic to the region that was already the namesake for [[Baltimore Oriole (disambiguation)#Baseball|several baseball teams]]. In 1932, [[Curley Byrd]] suggested that the namesake become the [[diamondback terrapin]] ("Malaclemys terrapin"), a species of land-dwelling turtle common throughout the state, particularly the [[Chesapeake Bay]] area where Dr. Byrd spent his early life. The student newspaper had already been named "[[The Diamondback]]" since 1921, and the athletics teams were sometimes referred to as the "Terrapins" as early as 1928. Newspapers began referring to the team simply as the "Terps" to shorten headlines. The truncated name stuck and is now in official use by the school.
The mascot is a diamondback terrapin named Testudo, which means "turtle" in [[Latin language|Latin]]. It is also the name of an ancient Roman [[Testudo formation|military tactic]], in which soldiers protected their infantry square from projectiles by completely enclosing it with their shields. Derivations of the word have also been used in scientific nomenclature related to the reptile, such as the order [[Testudines|Testudine]] and the family [[Testudinidae]]. In 1933, the graduating class raised funds for a 300-pound bronze replica of a terrapin. It was initially placed in front of [[Ritchie Coliseum]], which was then the home arena of the [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|basketball team]]. In 1951, after being the subject of numerous pranks, the statue was relocated to [[Maryland Stadium]], reinforced with 700 pounds of concrete, and anchored with steel rods. It was moved again in the 1960s, in front of [[University of Maryland Libraries|McKeldin Library]], and a second replica was placed at Maryland Stadium in 1992. In the 2000s, under coach Ralph Friedgen, it was a pregame tradition for the football players to walk 200 yards, through what is known as "Terp Alley", to the locker rooms, and touch the bronze Testudo statue.
Colors.
[[File:Flag of Maryland.svg|thumb|The Maryland state flag]]
Originally, the athletic teams had no official colors and often used gray or maroon and gray for their uniforms. Senior classes would sometimes select colors of their own choosing. In modern times, the uniforms have been based on some combination of the four colors of the [[Flag of Maryland|Maryland flag]]: red, white, black, and gold. The dominant colors have occasionally changed back and forth with changes of the head coach. In 1904, Maryland adopted a state flag based on the heraldry of [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore|Lord Calvert]]: the Calvert family arms (black and gold) quartered with his mother's Crossland family arms (red and white). From the early 1920s until 1942, the black and gold were adopted as the official school colors.
In [[1942 Maryland Terrapins football team|1942]], [[Clark Shaughnessy]] left [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] to coach at Maryland. He brought with him an affinity for a red and white color scheme and changed the team's uniforms. Shaughnessy left after one season, and the school switched back to the more traditional black and gold. He returned in [[1946 Maryland Terrapins football team|1946]] and again changed the colors to red and white. When [[Jim Tatum]] replaced him the following season, Shaughnessy's colors were retained. In 1961, Maryland wore gold jerseys with black numerals for the first time since 1945 for their season opener against [[1961 SMU Mustangs football team|Southern Methodist]]. In 1987, [[Joe Krivak]] introduced black jerseys with the Maryland flag on the sleeves for selected games and then black pants followed in 1991. [[Ron Vanderlinden]] took over in 1997 and a new black and white uniform was adopted. Under [[Ralph Friedgen]], Maryland returned to red and white in 2001, with black uniforms being reserved for select games. Maryland was one of the first schools to utilize the "blackout" concept, where fans uniformly wear the color to stand out in the stadium. It was introduced unofficially as the "Byrd Blackout" in 2005. For the [[2011 Maryland Terrapins football team|2011 season]], Maryland wore new [[Under Armour]] uniforms that offered a "dizzying array" of combinations in the four school colors. In the season opener against [[2011 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami]], the Terrapins unveiled a unique uniform based on the Maryland state flag that received nationwide media attention. In recent years since 2001 under [[Ralph Friedgen]] and continued by [[Randy Edsall]], Maryland has worn a uniform combination of all-red, red jerseys and red pants for the annual game on homecoming weekend.
Rivalries.
Navy.
[[File:2005 USNA UMD line.jpg|thumb|250px|Maryland and Navy [[Crab Bowl Classic|resumed competition]] in 2005 after a 40-year hiatus.]]
Maryland played the Naval Academy, which is also located in the state of Maryland, several times between the 1930s and 1960s. The rivalry is known as the [[Crab Bowl Classic]]. In 1964, an incident in which a Terrapins player flashed an obscene gesture prompted Navy officials to suspend the series for 40 years. They resumed play in 2005. As of 2010, the winner of the Crab Bowl Classic is awarded the [[Crab Bowl Trophy]].
Penn State.
Maryland and Penn State have met 45 times . Although Penn State leads the series with a lopsided 41–3–1 record against Maryland, many of those games were decided by field goals and turnovers. Because Maryland was in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] before joining the [[Big Ten Conference]] in July 2014, this rivalry was mainly kept alive through recruiting. The teams seldom played each other while Maryland was in the ACC but they competed in recruiting in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area and Delaware Valley. The teams met in State College on November 1, 2014, for the first time in 21 years. Maryland defeated Penn State 20–19, and at the conclusion of the game, [[Randy Edsall]] finished his interview by saying "You know what? Let the rivalry begin". The following year, the rivalry game was played at [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]] in Baltimore, Penn State defeated Maryland 31–30. In 2016, the Terrapins lost in a blowout in State College, after keeping it close for most of the first half, the Nittany Lions shut Maryland out in the final 30 minutes to cruise to a 38–14 win. Maryland hosted No. 12 Penn State in the final game of the 2017 season. The Nittany Lions scored on their opening possession and never looked back, leading 31–0 at the break. Penn State would score on their first three possessions in the second half, making the score 52–0. Maryland would get on the board on their next possession, kicking a field goal with 1:28 remaining in the 3rd making the score 52-3 Penn State. The Lions would go on to win by 63 points, defeating Maryland 66–3 tying the most lopsided win in the series dating back to 1993 when the Lions won 70–7. The matchup in 2018 saw the Lions extend their winning streak to 4 games defeating Maryland 38–3 on a soggy November afternoon at Beaver Stadium. The most recent matchup occurred Saturday November 7, 2020, at Beaver Stadium in State College. Maryland was coming off a thrilling OT homecoming win against Minnesota, and Penn State was looking to bounce back after a loss against No. 3 Ohio State. However, powered by transfer QB [[Taulia Tagovailoa]], it was Maryland who was able to capitalize on the momentum, winning 35–19 against Penn State on their own turf. But the next year Penn State got their revenge on Maryland and Taulia Tagovailoa by beating them on Maryland's turf 31 to 14. Maryland's most recent matchup was on 11/12/22 at Beaver Stadium in State College, where Penn State won in a 0–30 rout.
Rutgers.
Before both Maryland and Rutgers joined the Big Ten, the two schools played each other in nonconference play nine times between 1920 and 2009, with Maryland holding a 5-4 record. When both schools joined the Big Ten in 2014, they were placed in the Big Ten's newly formed East Division.
In seven of the 10 years in the Big Ten East era (2014–23), Maryland and Rutgers played each other the final week of the season. Through 2023, Maryland leads the rivalry 12-7, with a 7-3 record in the Big Ten. In 2016, Rutgers Athletic Director [[Patrick E. Hobbs]] and then-coach [[Chris Ash]] told reporters the schools had "initial conversations with Maryland" to create a trophy, but no trophy has been created to date.
The expanded 18-member Big Ten eliminated the divisional format in 2024 and introduced the Flex Protect XVIII model. The conference designated Maryland-Rutgers as one of 12 protected annual matchups through at least the 2028 season.
Virginia.
The Maryland–Virginia football rivalry was a designated official ACC cross-divisional series when Maryland was an ACC member and the teams have a long-standing rivalry due to proximity and history. The programs also vie for recruits in the same region, and more recently, an additional factor has been the schools' academic competition. Maryland and Virginia have occasionally served as spoilers for one another by precluding a championship or bowl game appearance. When Maryland moved out of the ACC in 2014 and into the Big Ten, the future of this series was put into question. On January 12, 2017, the schools jointly announced a home-home series would be played during the 2023 and 2024 seasons.
West Virginia.
West Virginia and Maryland have met 53 times . since their first game in 1919. The [[Maryland-West Virginia rivalry]] had a chance of becoming an annual game with West Virginia potentially joining the ACC in 2012, but the Mountaineers wound up joining the [[Big 12 Conference]]. In 2001, both programs hired new head coaches, with West Virginia being taken over by [[Rich Rodriguez]]. Owing to their proximity, the schools regularly raid their opponent's recruiting areas. The long-running series was put on hiatus for the 2008 and 2009 seasons when Maryland played a home-and-home series against the [[California Golden Bears]], but resumed in 2010. The series ran for five straight seasons from 2010, meeting twice in College Park, twice in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], and once at [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]] in Baltimore for a neutral site game. The series was on hiatus, but it resumed on September 4, 2021, when Maryland beat West Virginia 30-24 at [[Maryland Stadium]].
Individual honors.
Over the years, many Maryland players have received All-American honors. Eleven Terps have been named consensus (received a majority of votes) first-team All-Americans and one, [[E.J. Henderson]], has received that honor twice. Additionally, some have been awarded prestigious awards, including the [[Bednarik Award]], [[Butkus Award]], [[Lou Groza Award]], [[Outland Trophy]], and [[Lombardi Award]]. While no Terrapin has ever received the [[Heisman Trophy]], which is bestowed upon college football's most outstanding player, several have received votes by the award's selection committee. Quarterbacks [[Jack Scarbath]] and [[Bernie Faloney]] finished second and fourth in the voting in 1952 and 1953, respectively. Additionally, [[Bob Pellegrini]], [[Gary Collins (American football)|Gary Collins]], [[Randy White (American football)|Randy White]], and [[Boomer Esiason]] all finished in the top-ten of the voting for a Heisman. Seven Maryland players and four coaches have been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]]. [[Bear Bryant]], [[Jerry Claiborne]], [[Clark Shaughnessy]], and [[Jim Tatum]] were inducted as coaches. The players included [[Dick Modzelewski]], Bob Pellegrini, Jack Scarbath, and [[Bob Ward (American football, born 1927)|Bob Ward]]. [[Stan Jones (American football)|Stan Jones]] and Randy White were also inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].

West Virginia Mountaineers football

The West Virginia Mountaineers football team represents West Virginia University (WVU) in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of college football. West Virginia plays its home games at Milan Puskar Stadium on the campus of West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia. The Mountaineers have won or shared a total of 15 conference championships, including eight Southern Conference titles and seven Big East Conference titles. The Mountaineers compete in the Big 12 Conference.
History.
Early history (1891–1949).
The West Virginia University football program traces its origin back to November 28, 1891, when its first team fell to Washington &amp; Jefferson 72–0 on a converted cow pasture. Despite its humble beginning, West Virginia enjoyed a 25–23–3 overall record prior to 1900, which proved to be a fruitful century of Mountaineer football. The early 1900s brought about early successes for the program, namely during the 1903 and 1905 seasons when WVU posted records of 7–1 and 8–1 respectively. WVU produced a 6–3 record in the 1904 season, despite losing to Penn State, Pitt, and Michigan by a combined score of 217–0. The 1908–20 period produced the four-year head coaching tenures of C.A. Lueder (1908–11) and Mont McIntire (1916–17, 1919–20), representing the longest coaching tenures during this early period of Mountaineer football. Lueder's Mountaineers produced a 17–13–3 record, while McIntire's teams produced the most success of any Mountaineer team prior to 1921, compiling a 24–11–4 record including an 8–2 finish in 1919. That same Mountaineer team also produced West Virginia's first ever Consensus All-American and potential College Football Hall of Fame inductee, Ira Errett Rodgers. Rodgers scored 19 touchdowns and kicked 33 extra points for WVU in 1919 season, leading the nation with 147 total points. Rodgers also threw 11 touchdown passes that season, an unheard of feat at the time and a Mountaineer record until 1949. The Mountaineers enjoyed their first period of success during the 1920s, coinciding with the successful coaching tenures of Clarence Spears (1921–24) and Ira Errett Rodgers (1925–30, 1943–45). Under the tutelage of Spears, West Virginia compiled a 30–6–3 record with its best performance coming in the 1922 season. The 1922 edition of the Mountaineers remains the only team in West Virginia history to produce an unbeaten season, finishing with a 10–0–1 mark. Spears's Mountaineers surrendered only 34 total points in 1922, posting six consecutive shutouts to finish the regular season. The 1922 season also produced notable victories against rival Pitt and against Gonzaga in the East-West Bowl, the program's first bowl game appearance. Offensive tackle Russell Meredith garnered First-Team All-American honors. In homage to the successes of the 1922 season, West Virginia University undertook construction of what became the first incarnation of Mountaineer Field.
The Mountaineers continued their success under Spears in posting subsequent one-loss seasons in 1923 (7–1–1) and in 1924 (8–1), with Spears departing the program for Minnesota thereafter. Ira Errett Rodgers replaced Spears and the Mountaineers posted an 8–1 record in 1925. After a 6–4 finish in 1926 and a 2–4–3 record in 1927, the program produced an 8–2 finish in 1928. Rodgers's first tenure as West Virginia coach ended with records of 4–3–3 in 1929 and 5–5 in 1930. Taking over for Rodgers in 1931 was Earle "Greasy" Neale, but his tenure was short-lived as the Mountaineers failed to produce a single winning season under his guise, going a combined 12–16–3 over Neale's three years as coach. Charles Tallman, an End who achieved All-American status with the Mountaineers in 1923 with the Mountaineers, replaced Neale in 1934 and produced immediate results as the program posted 6–4 records in 1934 and 1936. Although West Virginia posted a 3–4–2 record in 1935, the program produced an All-American in Joe Stydahar, an offensive tackle. "Jumbo Joe" later became both a College Football Hall of Fame and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee. Despite his winning record, Tallman resigned after the 1936 season to pursue his career in law enforcement as Superintendent of the West Virginia State Police. Marshall Glenn picked up right where Tallman left off, leading West Virginia to an 8–1–1 record in 1937. The season concluded with an upset of Texas Tech in the 1938 Sun Bowl. Running back Harry Clarke led the way for the Mountaineers that season, rushing for a then school record 921 yards and 10 touchdowns. Glenn's success was short-lived, however, as subsequent WVU teams posted losing records of 4–5–1 in 1938 and 2–6–1 in 1939, leading to his ouster. West Virginia experienced a lag in success during much of the 1940s, producing only three winning seasons while witnessing the split coaching tenures of Bill Kern (1940–42, 1946–47) and the second appearance of Ira Errett Rodgers (1943–45). Under the direction of head coach Dudley DeGroot in the 1948 season, the Mountaineers returned to prominence with a 9–3 finish, adding another Sun Bowl victory to its resume with a 21–12 defeat of Texas Western (now known as UTEP). Despite that successful first season at the program's helm, DeGroot resigned after a disappointing 4–6–1 finish in 1949.
Art Lewis era (1950–1959).
When Art "Pappy" Lewis became West Virginia's head coach in 1950, he remarked that it was the job that he had always wanted. Known by his peers as an exceptional recruiter and by his players as a father figure, Lewis established a family-like atmosphere within the Mountaineer football program. Lewis's Mountaineer teams held true to form, experiencing their most consistent success during the 1950s as it ever had previously. After forgettable campaigns in 1950 and '1951, the 1952 season brought WVU its first winning season since 1948. The Mountaineers finished with a 7–2 record, highlighted by a 16–0 upset victory of No. 18 Pitt in Pittsburgh.
Beginning with the 1953 season, the Mountaineers would reel off three consecutive eight-win seasons and five Southern Conference (SoCon) championships in six seasons. In 1953, the Mountaineers finished with an 8–2 record, their first SoCon championship, a No. 10 ranking in the Associated Press (AP) Poll, and a berth in the Sugar Bowl with Georgia Tech. The 1954 edition of the Mountaineers also finished the regular season with an 8–1 mark, losing their only game to Pitt by a 13–10 score. The Mountaineers did not earn a bowl bid, however, despite winning their second consecutive SoCon title and earning a No. 12 ranking in the AP Poll. In 1955, the Mountaineers engineered yet another eight-win season and SoCon championship, but upset losses to Pitt and Syracuse doomed West Virginia's shot at a bowl bid. Despite its disappointing finish, WVU produced two All-American offensive linemen and future College Football Hall of Fame inductees in Bruce Bosley and Sam Huff. Bosley earned Consensus All-American status that season, becoming the first Mountaineer to do so since Ira Errett Rodgers in 1919.
Despite finishing with a modest 6–4 record in 1956, West Virginia won its fourth consecutive SoCon title with a 5–0 record in conference play. The 1957 season resulted in a 7–2–1 record and a 3–0 mark in Southern Conference play. Although the Mountaineers once again compiled an undefeated SoCon record, they were not awarded the conference championship, as VMI earned the title with a 9–0–1 overall record and 6–0 record in SoCon play. In 1958, the Mountaineers had their first losing season in eight years, but their 4–0 record in SoCon play earned them a 5th conference title in six seasons. The 1958 season was the final season that West Virginia would win a conference championship under Lewis's tenure. The Mountaineers finished 3–7 in 1959, losing the final five games of the season by a combined score of 24–140. Lewis resigned as head coach afterward. Despite the program's drop off in success in his final two seasons as coach, Lewis produced 58 victories overall during his tenure at West Virginia, placing him fourth overall in the program's history.
Gene Corum era (1960–1965).
After Lewis's departure, the program hit an all-time low in 1960 under first-year head coach Gene Corum, posting its worst season to date: 0–8–2. The Mountaineers were simply outclassed by their opponents, being outscored 40–259 on the season. The Mountaineers rebounded, however, and by 1962 were back to their winning ways, posting an 8–2 record and 4–0 conference record. Despite their undefeated conference record, once again the SoCon crown eluded the Mountaineers in favor of the VMI Keydets and their 6–0 record in conference play. West Virginia did not have to wait long for its next SoCon title, however, as the program won the title in the 1964 and 1965 seasons consecutively. The Mountaineers finished 7–4 in 1964 and participated in the Liberty Bowl against Utah, West Virginia's first bowl game in 11 years as well as the first major college football bowl game ever played indoors and to be broadcast nationwide in the United States. Corum's tenure ended thereafter, posting a 29–30–2 record over his six seasons as head coach. Corum's legacy went well beyond wins and losses, however, as he integrated WVU football in 1963 with the program's first African-American recruits in Roger Alford and Dick Leftridge.
Jim Carlen era (1966–1969).
Following the 1965 season, Jim Carlen took over for Corum as head coach. After a 3–5–2 finish in 1966, Carlen guided the Mountaineers to their 8th and final SoCon championship in 1967. West Virginia left the Southern Conference thereafter, participating as an independent until 1991. Carlen's Mountaineers would produce subsequent winning seasons in 1968 and 1969, posting records of 7–3 and 10–1, respectively. The 1969 edition of the Mountaineers was the most successful West Virginia team since the 1922 season. Not only did the Mountaineers win 10 games, but they earned their first bowl game victory since 1948 with a Peach Bowl victory over No. 19 South Carolina, as well as a No. 18 final ranking in the Coaches Poll. The dynamic rushing tandem of running back Bob Gresham (1,155 yards and 9 touchdowns) and fullback Jim Braxton (843 yards, 12 touchdowns) led the Mountaineers. Gresham became the second Mountaineer to ever rush for more than 1,000 yards (Garrett Ford, Sr. was the first with 1,068 yards in 1966). At the conclusion of the 1969 season, Carlen departed West Virginia for Texas Tech. The Mountaineers responded by hiring Bobby Bowden.
Bobby Bowden era (1970–1975).
It appeared that the Bobby Bowden era of Mountaineer football could not have begun more smoothly early in the 1970 season, or so it seemed. The Mountaineers were 4–1 to start the season and led arch rival Pitt 35–8 at halftime in week six. What transpired was one of the most infamous collapses in Backyard Brawl and West Virginia football history. The Mountaineers surrendered 28 unanswered points, losing to the Panthers 36–35 and leading Bowden to remark that he had "embarrassed the whole state of West Virginia" in the process. Despite the disappointment of the Pitt defeat, West Virginia went on to finish the 1970 season with an 8–3 record. Fullback Jim Braxton and linebacker Dale Farley earned All-American honors.
The Mountaineers continued their winning ways under Bowden in 1971 and 1972, posting records of 7–4 and 8–4 respectively. The 1972 West Virginia team earned the program's first trip back to a bowl game in three years, participating once again in the Peach Bowl against North Carolina State. The season also witnessed the offensive prowess of running back Kerry Marbury and wide receiver Danny Buggs. Marbury ran for 16 touchdowns in 1972, a record that remained unbroken until 2002. Buggs recorded 35 receptions for 791 yards and eight touchdowns, ran for four touchdowns, and returned two punts for touchdowns to amass 14 total touchdowns.
The 1973 and 1974 seasons, however, were not successful campaigns for the Mountaineers, as they finished with records of 6–5 and 4–7. Despite the disappointment of those seasons, Danny Buggs earned All-American status for his contributions in both campaigns. The 1975 season was successful as the Mountaineers compiled a 9–3 record, a 13–10 Peach Bowl victory over North Carolina State, and a final ranking of No. 17 in the Coaches Poll and No. 20 in the AP Poll. Additionally, the Mountaineers upset the No. 20 Pitt Panthers 17–14 on a game-winning field goal in the closing seconds in yet another memorable chapter of the Backyard Brawl. Bowden later described the victory as one of the most exciting ones of his coaching career. Following the 1975 season, Bowden left WVU to become the head coach at Florida State, where he would become the second winningest coach in NCAA Division I-A/FBS history. In just six seasons with the Mountaineers, Bowden produced a 42–26 record, good for fifth all-time in the program. Bowden's departure not only signaled the end of his tenure at West Virginia, but to the end of WVU's winning ways in the 1970s.
Frank Cignetti era (1976–1979).
Under the direction of Frank Cignetti, the Mountaineers endured four consecutive losing seasons. West Virginia completed the 1976 season with a 5–6 record, losing four of its final six games. The disappointment of 1976 was realized again the following season, as the Mountaineers posted another 5–6 finish in 1977. After a promising 4–1 start to the season, including an upset road victory over No. 11 Maryland, WVU lost five of its final six games. The Mountaineers finished 2–9 in 1978, being outscored 364–167. It was later revealed that Cignetti had suffered from a rare form of cancer during the season, nearly losing his life on the operating table during a procedure to remove his spleen in the winter of 1978. The 1979 season was Cignetti's final with the program. The Mountaineers produced another 5–6 finish, losing their first three games and later dropping three out of their final four games.
Despite the program's losing seasons during Cignetti's tenure, Cignetti managed to land prized recruit and future Consensus All-American linebacker Darryl Talley, as well as standout quarterback and future Athletic Director Oliver Luck and running back Robert Alexander. Cignetti's coaching staffs also consisted of some of the best coaches in college football, including Nick Saban, Joe Pendry and Rick Trickett (who, along with Rich Rodriguez, was later credited as an innovator in utilizing the zone blocking scheme in conjunction with the run-based spread offense at WVU). However, with a 17–27 record during his four years with the program, and in having to follow in the footsteps of the great Bobby Bowden (who later became the second all-time leader in victories amongst NCAA FBS coaches), Cignetti's legacy is one of the most conflicted in the program's history.
Don Nehlen era (1980–2000).
In the wake of Frank Cignetti's firing, the West Virginia Athletic Department determined that a full rebuild was in order. On December 10, 1979, West Virginia introduced Don Nehlen as its new head coach, the 30th coach in the program's history. Coinciding with Nehlen's hire was the construction of the second incarnation of Mountaineer Field, the program's current home stadium. Nehlen brought several changes to the Mountaineer football program, including a new logo and color scheme that remains in use to this day. The result was consistency and success for the program during his two-decade tenure at West Virginia. After a 6–6 campaign in 1980, Nehlen's 1981 Mountaineer team produced the first of 15 winning seasons under his direction. It also marked the first of three consecutive nine-win seasons and four consecutive bowl game appearances for the Mountaineers. Led by senior quarterback Oliver Luck's 2,448 yards passing and 16 touchdowns, the 1981 team posted a 9–3 record and earned a trip back to the Peach Bowl, where they defeated the Florida Gators 26–6. WVU also finished ranked in the polls for the first time since 1975, coming in at No. 17 and No. 18 in the AP and Coaches Polls, respectively.
The 1982 Mountaineers experienced similar success. Sparked by their come-from-behind upset victory over No. 9 Oklahoma to open the season, the Mountaineers finished with a 9–2 record, remaining ranked in the AP poll throughout the season en route to a Gator Bowl berth with Bobby Bowden and Florida State. Despite its Gator Bowl loss, West Virginia once again finished the season 9–3 and ranked 19th in both final polls. The team also produced the program's first Consensus All-American since 1955 in senior linebacker Darryl Talley. The Mountaineers won their first six games at the outset of the 1983 season, attaining a No. 4 ranking in the AP Poll. With a 41–23 upset loss to 1983 in week 8, however, West Virginia's hopes of an undefeated season collapsed. WVU lost three of its final five regular season games before defeating Kentucky in the Hall of Fame Classic to finish the season at 9–3. It was the third consecutive season for WVU to finish ranked, coming in at No. 16 in both the AP and Coaches Polls. Quarterback Jeff Hostetler led the offensive attack with 2,345 yards passing and 16 touchdowns, while Kicker Paul Woodside received All-American honors in converting 21 of 25 field goal attempts and all 37 of his extra point attempts en route to a team-leading 100 points.
Although the 1984 season had all off the makings of a memorable one for West Virginia, the Mountaineers experienced another letdown. WVU started the season with a 7–1 record, posting an upset victory over No. 4 Boston College and its first victory over Penn State in 25 meetings along the way. The Mountaineers were upset in each of their final three regular season games, however, losing to Virginia, Rutgers and Temple. WVU rebounded to defeat Texas Christian in the Bluebonnet Bowl, finishing the season at 8–4 with a No. 21 ranking in the final Coaches poll. The Mountaineers also produced three All-Americans in return specialist Willie Drewrey, kicker Paul Woodside, and tight end Rob Bennett. After four consecutive seasons of bowl berths and finishes in at least one of the polls, West Virginia went on a two-year drought in 1985 and 1986, finishing those seasons with records of 7–3–1 and 4–7 (Nehlen's first of only four losing seasons) respectively. The shortcomings of those seasons came to a head in 1987, where the Mountaineers endured a season of growing pains and near-misses. Despite a 1–3 start, West Virginia rallied to finish the regular season at 6–5 with four of its five losses coming by deficits of 5 points or less. Freshman quarterback Major Harris led the way for the Mountaineers, compiling 16 total touchdowns and providing glimpses of what was to come in his illustrious collegiate career. The season culminated in a 35–33 loss to No. 11 Oklahoma State in the Sun Bowl, a game in which the Mountaineers led 24–14 at halftime and lost on a failed two-point conversion attempt with 1:13 remaining.
The 1988 edition of the Mountaineers achieved an undefeated regular season, compiling 11 wins for the first time in its history. The success of the regular season culminated in West Virginia's first and only trip to a National Championship Game in its history, where the No. 3 Mountaineers met No. 1 Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl. Notre Dame went on to win 34–21 and claimed the national championship. West Virginia finished the 1988 campaign ranked No. 5 in both the AP and Coaches Polls. Major Harris compiled 610 yards rushing, 1,915 yards passing, and 20 total touchdowns on the season. Coming off of its first ever 11-win season and with junior Major Harris returning to lead a potent offense, West Virginia entered the 1989 season with high expectations and a No. 17 ranking in the AP Poll. The Mountaineers raced to a 4–0 record and to No. 9 in the AP Poll. In Week 5 against No. 10 Pitt, however, West Virginia fell victim to another memorable collapse in the Backyard Brawl. Trailing 31–9 in the 4th quarter, Pitt scored 22 unanswered points and kicked a game-tying field goal as time expired to force a 31–31 tie. The Mountaineers suffered another defeat the following week with a 12–10 home loss to Virginia Tech, followed by a 19–9 loss to No. 16 Penn State in State College. Despite those defeats, WVU finished the regular season at 8–2–1, a No. 17 ranking in the AP Poll, and a trip to the Gator Bowl to face No. 14 Clemson. The Mountaineers lost 27–7 and finished the season at 8–3–1 with a No. 21 ranking in the final AP Poll. The 1990 season, West Virginia's final as an NCAA Division I-A Independent, coincided with a 4–7 finish.
West Virginia entered the 1991 season as new members of the Big East in what became a 20-year affiliation with the conference. After finishes of 6–5 in 1991 and 5–4–2 in 1992, the Mountaineers returned to ranks of the college football elite in the 1993 season. For the second time in six seasons, West Virginia produced an undefeated, 11-win regular season in 1993. The Mountaineers engineered several close victories, beginning with a 36–34 upset of No. 17 Louisville at home in Morgantown. In its final two regular season games, WVU twice erased 4th quarter deficits to defeat No. 4 Miami and No. 11 Boston College. Despite finishing the regular season undefeated and ranked No. 2 in the Coaches Poll and No. 3 in the AP Poll, West Virginia was not selected to play in the Orange Bowl for a possible national championship. The Bowl Coalition system, designed to place the top two ranked teams in a bowl to determine the National Champion, slotted the Mountaineers at No. 3 behind 11–1 Florida State. The Seminoles were selected to play No. 1 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl for the national championship, while West Virginia settled for a Sugar Bowl berth against SEC Champion Florida. The Gators routed the Mountaineers 41–7, denying West Virginia its perfect season. WVU finished the season at 11–1, ranked No. 6 in the Coaches Poll and No. 7 in the AP Poll. Robert Walker amassed a then-school record 1,250 rushing yards, along with 11 touchdowns on the season.
The 1993 season was WVU's final season with double-digit victories during Nehlen's tenure as subsequent Mountaineer teams failed to recapture that level of success. After posting a 7–6 record in 1994 and a 5–6 mark in 1995, the 1996 Mountaineers showed promise of returning the program to national prominence. West Virginia began the 1996 season with a 7–0 record, only to lose three of its final four regular season games en route to an 8–3 record and a 20–13 defeat in the Gator Bowl at the hands of No. 12 North Carolina to finish 8–4. The Mountaineers put together another strong start in 1997, taking a 7–2 record into the final two weeks of the season. Once again, the Mountaineers faltered as they lost 21–14 at Notre Dame and 41–38 in triple overtime to a 5–5 Pitt team to finish the regular season at 7–4. The late season collapse culminated in another bowl game defeat, this time to Georgia Tech in the Carquest Bowl. Despite the disappointing conclusion to the season, quarterback Marc Bulger emerged as a capable leader throwing for 2,465 yards and 14 touchdowns. Running back Amos Zereoué shattered Robert Walker's rushing record with 1,589 yards, and his 18 rushing touchdowns are the second most in a single season at WVU.
The 1998 season brought high expectations for the Mountaineers, as WVU entered the season ranked No. 11 in the AP Poll. Despite dropping its opening game to No. 1 Ohio State, West Virginia rebounded to win its next four games and went on to finish the season with an 8–3 record and 5–2 mark in Big East conference play. The Mountaineers failed to attain nine wins, however, as they lost their 8th consecutive bowl game in the Insight.com Bowl to Missouri. Bulger set two WVU records with 3,607 yards passing and 31 touchdown passes, while Zereoué amassed 1,462 yards rushing and 13 touchdowns in his final season as a Mountaineer. Receivers Shawn Foreman and David Saunders finished with eight touchdown receptions each. After a 4–7 finish in 1999, Don Nehlen's final season with the Mountaineers in 2000 culminated in a 7–5 record with a victory in the Music City Bowl over Ole Miss, ending West Virginia's streak of futility in bowl games. Overall, Nehlen posted a 149–93–4 record during his tenure at West Virginia, making him both the longest-serving and most successful head coach in Mountaineer history. While his coaching tenure contained numerous successes, Nehlen's time at WVU also included its share of shortcomings as his Mountaineer teams often struggled against ranked opponents and in bowl games. However, as the man responsible for shaping the Mountaineer football program and bringing it to national relevancy in his 21 seasons in Morgantown, Nehlen was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2005. Most importantly, his tenure laid the foundation for the program's most successful and prominent era.
Rich Rodriguez era (2001–2007).
After Nehlen's retirement, WVU named then-Clemson offensive coordinator and West Virginia native Rich Rodriguez as its first new head coach in 20 years. Rodriguez's tenure began ignominiously, as the 2001 edition of the Mountaineers finished 3–8, its worst record since 1978. The failures of 2001, however, set the stage for the emergence of the most successful era in Mountaineer football history. The 2002 season represented the biggest single-season turnaround in program history. Despite a 5–3 record through the season's first eight games, the Mountaineers reeled off four consecutive victories, including upset road wins over then-ranked rivals Virginia Tech (No. 13) and Pitt (No. 17). West Virginia finished the regular season at 9–3 overall, with a 6–1 conference record for second place in the Big East, and a berth in the Continental Tire Bowl with Virginia. Despite losing its bowl game, West Virginia finished with a 9–4 record and was ranked in both the final Coaches (No. 20) and AP (No. 25) polls for the first time since 1993. The momentum generated from the 2002 campaign was short-lived as the Mountaineers stumbled to a 1–4 record early in the 2003 season. In similar fashion to the previous season, West Virginia rebounded and recorded seven wins in a row, including upsets of No. 3 Virginia Tech and No. 16 Pitt. The Mountaineers ended the regular season at 8–4 with a 6–1 conference mark, earning them a share of their first Big East title since 1993. West Virginia earned a trip to the Gator Bowl for a rematch with rival Maryland. The result for the Mountaineers was a near duplicate of their 34–7 defeat to the Terrapins earlier in the season, as they fell 41–7 and finished the season 8–5. In contrast to 2002 and 2003, the 2004 season may best be remembered for what the Mountaineers failed to accomplish. West Virginia, ranked No. 10 in the AP Poll to begin the season, carried an 8–1 record through its first nine games. The Mountaineers collapsed in the final two games of the regular season, however, losing to No. 21 Boston College and to Pitt. West Virginia squandered its opportunity to win the Big East outright, leading to a four-way tie for first place and the BCS Fiesta Bowl nomination going to Pitt by tiebreaker. The disappointing season drew to a close with 30–18 loss to Florida State in the Gator Bowl, giving WVU an 8–4 record.
The 2005 season was a noteworthy one for the Mountaineers. After a 5–1 (albeit offensively sluggish) start to the season, the Mountaineers came alive in Week 7 against No. 19 Louisville. Quarterback Pat White and running back Steve Slaton helped to erase a 24–7 4th quarter deficit en route to a thrilling 46–44 triple overtime victory. From that point forward, the Mountaineers outscored their opponents 156–39 en route to a 10–1 finish and a 7–0 record in conference play for their second outright Big East championship. The Mountaineers also earned their first ever BCS bowl game berth, facing No. 8 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. West Virginia scored 21 points in the 1st quarter, holding on for a 38–35 upset victory. The Mountaineers finished the 2005 season with their third 11-win season and achieved rankings of No. 5 and No. 6 in the AP and Coaches Polls, respectively. The Mountaineers once again posted 11 wins in the 2006 season, narrowly missing out on another Big East championship after losses to Louisville and South Florida. West Virginia remained ranked in the top 15 in both polls throughout the season, earning another New Year's Day bowl game as they met Georgia Tech in the Gator Bowl. The Mountaineers came away with another 38–35 victory, winning consecutive bowl games for the first time since the 1983 and 1984 seasons. Additionally, center Dan Mozes and running back Steve Slaton earned Consensus All-American honors. Slaton's 1,744 yards rushing set the WVU single-season rushing record.
The 2007 season may well be regarded as the most infamous season in West Virginia football history. The Mountaineers attained a preseason ranking of No. 3 and had national championship aspirations. WVU raced to a 10–1 record, including a 66–21 victory over UConn to secure its fifth Big East title and its second BCS bowl appearance. The Mountaineers rose to as high as No. 2 in the AP Poll and No. 1 in the Coaches Poll, needing only a victory at home over a 4–7, 28-point underdog Pitt team in the 100th installment of the Backyard Brawl to secure its second ever National Championship Game appearance. That victory did not come, as the Mountaineers suffered a devastating 13–9 defeat. The fallout of the Pitt defeat reached beyond national championship implications for the program, as it culminated in the departure of Rich Rodriguez to Michigan. Rodriguez left prior to West Virginia's meeting with No. 3 Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl. The Mountaineers rebounded, posting a 48–28 victory over the heavily favored Sooners.
Bill Stewart era (2007–2010).
Long-time assistant coach Bill Stewart, named as interim head coach for the game, received a five-year contract to become West Virginia's 32nd head coach. The Mountaineers concluded the 2007 season with an 11–2 record and were ranked at No. 6 in both of the final AP and Coaches Polls. The Mountaineers transitioned into the Bill Stewart era in the 2008 season. WVU amassed a 9–4 record and a second-place finish in the Big East, closing the season Meineke Car Care Bowl victory over North Carolina and a No. 23 ranking in the AP Poll. The bowl victory was West Virginia's fourth in a row, giving Pat White a postseason record of 4–0 as a starting quarterback. During Week 13 of the 2008 season, White set the NCAA rushing yardage record for quarterbacks with a 200-yard performance in a 35–21 win over Louisville.
The 2009 season culminated in another nine-win campaign and second-place finish in the Big East for the Mountaineers. WVU ended its two-year losing streak in the Backyard Brawl with an upset victory over No. 8 Pitt. West Virginia's season concluded with a loss in the Gator Bowl to Florida State in Bobby Bowden's final game as a head coach. The 2010 season brought the program its third consecutive nine-win season. Nonetheless, the season was ultimately a disappointment for the Mountaineers. Despite assembling arguably the strongest defense in program history (surrendering only 176 total points, an average of 13.5 per game) and having a talented offense, West Virginia struggled with consistency all season. The Mountaineers lost to No. 15 LSU, Syracuse and UConn by a combined 14 points, while the Mountaineer defense did not surrender more than 23 points scored against in a single game throughout the season. WVU's loss to Connecticut in Week 9 came back to haunt the Mountaineers as they lost out on a BCS Bowl bid by virtue of a tiebreaker to the Huskies.
Dana Holgorsen era (2011–2018).
Prior to West Virginia's Champs Sports Bowl match up with North Carolina State, Dana Holgorsen was hired as the "coach-in-waiting," serving as offensive coordinator during the 2011 season and replacing Stewart as head coach in 2012. Luck didn't believe Stewart was capable of leading the Mountaineers to a national championship, and was also concerned about declining season ticket sales. The relationship between Stewart and Holgorsen imploded just months later. Colin Dunlap of KDKA-FM in Pittsburgh claimed that Stewart had asked him to dig up dirt on Holgorsen while Dunlap was a reporter at the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette." While athletic director Luck was unable to substantiate the claims, he decided that the coach-in-waiting arrangement was untenable, leading to Stewart's resignation and Holgorsen becoming head coach.
The Mountaineers finished the 2011 regular season with a 9–3 record (5–2 in Big East play) and a share of its 7th Big East title. The Mountaineers were the only Big East team ranked in the final BCS standings (No. 23), earning the BCS bid by tiebreaker and an Orange Bowl berth against ACC champion No. 14 Clemson. In its first Orange Bowl appearance, the Mountaineers soundly defeated Clemson 70–33 and set an NCAA record for points scored in a bowl game. The Mountaineers finished the season at 10–3 and ranked No. 17 in the AP Poll and No. 18 in the Coaches Poll. From 2002 to 2011, the Mountaineer football program yielded its most prolific era to date, producing a 95–33 record. During that span WVU participated in ten bowl games, finished ranked in at least one of the AP or Coaches Polls on seven occasions, won six Big East Conference titles, and produced three BCS bowl game victories.
In the midst of continued college football conference realignment, WVU joined the Big 12 Conference as of July 1, 2012. Despite starting the 2012 season at 5–0 and climbing into the top 5 in the AP and Coaches Polls, WVU lost six of its final eight games en route to a 7–6 finish. The season culminated in a loss to rival Syracuse in the Pinstripe Bowl. The 2013 season brought WVU's first losing campaign since 2001. After a 4–5 start and an opportunity to secure bowl eligibility with two victories, WVU faltered in its final three games to finish 4–8. The Mountaineers rebounded in the 2014 season, posting a 7–6 record against a schedule featuring five opponents ranked in the top 15. WVU raced to a 6–2 start, only to lose four of its final five games. The Mountaineers returned to a bowl game in 2014, losing in the Liberty Bowl. WVU returned to the eight-win plateau in 2015 season, posting a 7–5 record during the regular season and winning the Cactus Bowl. In the 2016 season, the Mountaineers finished in second place in the Big 12 and finished the season with a 10–3 record, the ninth season in the program's history with at least ten victories. The season culminated in a loss to Miami in the Russell Athletic Bowl. Prior to the conclusion of the regular season, Holgorsen and WVU agreed to a five-year contract extension. In 2017, WVU finished 7–6. The season concluded with a loss in the Heart of Dallas Bowl. The Mountaineers started the season 7–3, only to lose their final three games after a season-ending hand injury to quarterback Will Grier. The 2018 season saw the Mountaineers start with an 8–1 record, earning top 10 rankings in the polls and in the College Football Playoff. WVU faltered in its final two regular season games, however, and failed to earn a berth in the Big 12 Championship Game. WVU finished 8–4 with a loss in the Camping World Bowl. Soon thereafter, Dana Holgorsen left the program to take the head coaching position at Houston.
Neal Brown era (2019–2024).
On January 5, 2019, Troy head coach Neal Brown was named the 34th head coach of the program. Brown brought with him an exciting, up-tempo- pass-oriented offense known as the Air raid. WVU finished the 2019 season with a 5–7 record, failing to qualify for a bowl game for the first time since 2013. The Mountaineers rebounded in 2020, posting 6–4 record culminating in a Liberty Bowl victory against Army in their first meeting since the 1961 season. 
In 2021, the Mountaineers were looking for improvement, but were met with more of the same, finishing with a 6–6 record through the regular season. They began the season with a rivalry loss to Maryland, and then defeated LIU and won back the Black Diamond Trophy from Virginia Tech. The team finished the season in the Guaranteed Rate Bowl at Chase Field in Phoenix, resulting in an 18–6 loss to the Minnesota Golden Gophers. The Mountaineer's 2022 season was looked at with much excitement after the team was able to successfully sign former five-star quarterback JT Daniels in the offseason, and the anticipation of the renewal of the Backyard Brawl for the first time since 2011. The season kicked off with the Mountaineers traveling to Pittsburgh to play the Panthers at Acrisure Stadium. However, the Mountaineers failed to start the season with a win, losing the game 38-31. A few weeks later, after losing to Kansas at home in overtime and defeating Towson, the team successfully defended the Black Diamond Trophy at Virginia Tech, winning 33–10. The Mountaineers went on to lose four out of the five conference games. The season ended with optimism after Sophomore Backup-QB Garrett Greene defeated the Oklahoma Sooners 23–20 for the first time since entering the Big 12 Conference. After this game, Greene was named the Mountaineer's starter. The Mountaineers finished the season 5–7 (3–6 conference), failing to qualify for a bowl game for the 2nd time in the Neal Brown Era.
The 2023 season started with the renewal of another West Virginia rival. The team was set to play the Penn State Nittany Lions for the first time since 1992. After the Mountaineers lost the season opener 38-15, the team rallied to win four games in a row, including a win against Pitt at home. After dropping the next two games to Houston and Oklahoma State, they were able to string together four wins in the last five games to give them a regular season record of 8-4, the best of Neal Brown's WVU tenure. They went on to defeat the North Carolina Tar Heels in the 2023 Duke's Mayo Bowl by a score of 30-10. However, the success of the 2023 season was unable to continue through the 2024 season. The Mountaineers dropped to a 1–2 record in non-conference play with losses to rivals Penn State and Pitt. Conference play wasn't a success either, and the team finished the season with a 6–6 record. On December 1, 2024, the day after losing to Texas Tech in the regular season finale 52-15, West Virginia University fired Neal Brown. He went 37-35 during his tenure in Morgantown. Offensive coordinator Chad Scott took over as interim head coach until the conclusion of the Frisco Bowl against the Memphis Tigers, which the Mountaineers would go on to lose by a score of 37-42.
Return of Rich Rodriguez (2025–present).
On December 11, 2024, it was reported that Rodriguez and West Virginia University had agreed in principle that he would become the next head football coach of the West Virginia Mountaineers with contract terms and language yet to be finalized. On December 12, 2024, he was officially named the 36th head football coach in the history of the West Virginia Mountaineers.
Championships.
Conference championships.
West Virginia has won or shared a conference championship on 15 occasions, ten outright and five shared, including eight Southern Conference (SoCon) titles and seven Big East Conference titles.
† Co-champion
Regional championships.
The ECAC Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy is an annual award given to the best team in the Eastern Region of FBS-level college football. West Virginia has received the award as Eastern Champion on four occasions.
Bowl games.
West Virginia has participated in 41 bowl games throughout its history, compiling a 17–24 record through the 2024 season. The Mountaineers endured a dubious string of post-season futility from 1987 to 2004, losing 11 of 12 bowl games including eight consecutive losses between 1987 and 1998. However, West Virginia won four straight bowl games from 2005 to 2008 with Pat White, who became the first ever quarterback to win all four bowl games as a starter in Division I college football. These are West Virginia's last ten bowl games.
Head coaches.
The West Virginia Mountaineers have had 34 head coaches throughout the program's history. With 149 victories, Don Nehlen is first overall in the program's history, followed by Dana Holgorsen (61 wins) and Rich Rodriguez (60).
Rankings.
West Virginia has finished a season ranked in at least one of the Associated Press (AP) or Coaches polls on 22 occasions. The Mountaineers have finished ranked amongst the top 10 in college football on five occasions. West Virginia attained its highest-ever ranking in the polls during week 14 of the 2007 season, when they were ranked No. 1 in the Coaches Poll and No. 2 in the AP Poll.
The Mountaineers have concluded the regular season ranked in the final rankings of the College Football Playoff (CFP) on two occasions. West Virginia finished the regular season ranked seven times in the final rankings of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS), a predecessor to the CFP. The Bowl Coalition, a predecessor to the CFP and BCS systems, ranked WVU 3rd in its final standings at the conclusion of the 1993 regular season. As of the end of the 2020 season, the Mountaineers were 49–122–2 against opponents ranked in the AP Poll.
Facilities.
Mountaineer Field.
Since 1891, the Mountaineers have played their home games in Morgantown, West Virginia along with neutral-site games at numerous locations throughout West Virginia, most notably in Charleston, Clarksburg, Fairmont, Parkersburg and Wheeling. The construction of Old Mountaineer Field in 1924 gave WVU its first permanent home facility. Located next to Woodburn Hall in what is now considered the Downtown portion of the WVU campus, the first incarnation of Mountaineer Field consisted of a horseshoe-type seating arrangement. The stadium eventually grew in capacity to its peak of 38,000 by 1979. The physical location of the stadium made it impossible for further expansion to take place, however, and led to the relocation of the football program to the new Mountaineer Field in 1980. The old stadium was razed in 1987. At the southwest corner where the stadium once stood, there is a horseshoe-shaped monument commemorating the stadium. From 1924 to 1979 the Mountaineers played 267 games at Old Mountaineer Field, compiling a 171–82–14 record.
The Mountaineers have played their home games at the second incarnation of Mountaineer Field since 1980. The bowl-shaped stadium is located on the Evansdale section of the WVU campus. Originally constructed with an east–west configuration of the seating areas and a capacity of 50,000, subsequent seating additions at the north and south ends of the facility increased the capacity to over 63,000 by 1986 through the 2003 season. Suites were first introduced to Mountaineer Field in 1994, with 12 suites being constructed in the first row of the press box on the stadium's west end. General admission seating in the north end zone was replaced with 18 suites in 2004 to create the "Touchdown Terrace" section, while four additional suites were added in the south end zone in 2007. The construction of Touchdown Terrace in 2004 brought the stadium's capacity to 60,000.
As of November 29, 2003, the stadium has been named "Milan Puskar Stadium" in honor of Milan Puskar, the founder of Morgantown-based Mylan Pharmaceuticals, in recognition of his $20 million donation to the university.
Due to Mountaineer Field's capacity and the relatively smaller populations of West Virginia's largest cities, it has been suggested that Morgantown becomes the largest "city" in the state on game days due to the influx of spectators at the stadium. Crowds at Mountaineer Field have earned the reputation of being loud and boisterous, creating a hostile atmosphere for opposing teams.
The largest crowd to ever attend a game at the stadium was 70,222, set on November 20, 1993.
Milan Puskar Center.
Also constructed in 1980 was the "Facilities Building" (now the Milan Puskar Center) to house the program's football offices. Originally located south of Mountaineer Field, in 1985 the facility was connected to the stadium when an 11,000-seat expansion enclosed the South end zone bowl. The 39,000-square-foot facility houses the team's locker room and training facilities, including a 23,000-square-foot weight training facility on the first floor of the complex. The second floor of the Puskar Center houses the offensive and defensive wings for the coaching staffs, the team meeting room, player position rooms, the football staff conference room, and the Reynolds Family Academic Performance Center. Also located on the second floor of the Puskar Center is the Donald J. Brohard Hall of Traditions. Made possible through a gift by WVU alumnus and Datatel, Inc. founder Ken Kendrick, the Hall of Traditions opened in 2006 to honor the history of the WVU football program. The Hall of Traditions houses interactive displays, videos, photos, records and information on the program. The Hall is open to the public on weekdays throughout the year.
The Puskar Center underwent significant renovations in 2012 and 2013, aimed specifically at improving the weight room, the aesthetics of the facility's interior, lounge space for the football players and upgrading the coaches' meeting areas. Further renovation of the Puskar Center in 2015 culminated with the construction of a new team meeting room for the players and coaches. 
The structure has 162 theater-style chairs to seat an entire football team, as well as support staff and personnel. The room is also utilized for the head coach's weekly news conferences during the season, as well as media interviews with players and other coaches.
Further renovations to the Puskar Center are planned for the future as part of WVU's master plan for athletic facilities.
Practice fields.
The Mountaineers utilize two facilities for indoor and outdoor football practices, the Caperton Indoor Practice Facility and the Steve Antoline Family Football Practice Field.
The Caperton facility opened in August 1998. The indoor space is equipped with a 90-yard FieldTurf playing surface with seven yards of safety zone surrounding the entire field. Total length from wall to wall is 105 yards, with more than 75,000 square feet of practice room. Located behind the Caperton facility is the Steve Antoline Family Practice Field, a FieldTurf facility previously consisting of two grass fields. The Antoline facility consists of a full-length 120-yard field along with an adjacent 60-yard field.
Traditions.
"Take Me Home, Country Roads".
The theme song of West Virginia University, John Denver's "Take Me Home, Country Roads" has been performed at every home football game pregame show since 1972. In 1980, John Denver performed his hit song during pregame festivities to a sold-out crowd at Mountaineer Field. His performance marked the dedication of the second incarnation of Mountaineer Field and the first game for head coach Don Nehlen. After every home win, WVU players and fans link arm-in-arm and sing along to a recording of the song.
Pregame show.
Performed by the Pride of West Virginia marching band, the pregame show includes such traditions as the 220-beat per minute run-on introductory drum cadence, the formation of the "Flying WV" logo to the tune of "Fight Mountaineers," and the forming of the state of West Virginia while playing the university fight song "Hail, West Virginia." The band also performs "Take Me Home, Country Roads" as well as Aaron Copland's "Simple Gifts." The fans participate in several cheers during the pregame show, notably chanting "W-V-U" to the roll of the band's drum line prior to the playing of "Fight Mountaineers," as well as chanting "Let's Go Mountaineers" in between playings of "Hail, West Virginia." 
Stadium chants.
WVU students encompassing the "Mountaineer Maniacs" section and fans alike participate in several chants during WVU home games. The "Let's Go...Mountaineers" chant, with the east end of the stadium shouting "Let's Go..." and the west end responding with "Mountaineers," is the most popular amongst those in attendance. Since the mid 2000s, West Virginia fans also participate in the "1st Down" and "3rd Down" cheers. The "1st Down" cheer can be heard at both home and away games prior to the announcement of a Mountaineer first down. Mountaineer fans raise their hands and hold a cheer of "OH!" in unison until the first down call is made by the public address announcer. Following the call, the fans pump their arms up and down three times to a chant of "W-V-U," clap and then signal to the end zone chanting "first down!" The "3rd Down" cheer is similar, with Mountaineer fans raising their arms and waving three fingers upon the announcement of "third down" by the public address. 
The Mountaineer.
WVU incorporated the Mountaineers nickname in 1905 after the coining of West Virginia's state motto, "Mountaineers are Always Free." Prior to 1905, the team was referred to as the "Snakes." The Mountaineer mascot first appeared at WVU sporting events during the 1934–35 school year and has been a fixture ever since. The Mountaineer is selected each year by the Mountain Honorary, composed of members of West Virginia University's senior class. The Mountaineer's costume is tailored to fit each winner, and male Mountaineers customarily grow beards during their tenure to go along with the coonskin cap and rifle, although the beard is not a requirement for the mascot position. The mascot is modeled after the Mountaineer bronze statue located in front of the Mountainlair student union building on the WVU campus. During football games, the Mountaineer mascot will fire his musket upon the team's entrance prior to kickoff, at the conclusion of each quarter and following every score.
Gold Rush, True Blue and Stripe the Stadium.
Introduced by head coach Rich Rodriguez during the 2007 season, the "Gold Rush" is an ongoing tradition with WVU fans at Mountaineer Field. Partially inspired by the Penn State "White Out" tradition, as well as the "black-out" effect created by Louisville Cardinals fans dressed in black during their game against WVU in 2006, Rodriguez encouraged Mountaineer fans to dress entirely in gold for the rematch between WVU and Louisville in 2007. WVU's home schedule has featured a Gold Rush home game in each of its subsequent seasons. Since 2008, West Virginia University has worked in conjunction with the United Way to promote the event, selling gold T-shirts to fans with the proceeds benefiting the WVU United Way Campaign.
In contrast, WVU designates one home game per season as a "True Blue" game where the fans in attendance are encouraged to wear blue throughout the stadium. The Mountaineer players wear their all-blue uniform sets for these particular games.
The fan tradition of "Stripe the Stadium" has been in place since the Mountaineers joined the Big 12 Conference in 2012. Fans are encouraged to wear a designated color for their respective seating section. Fans in even sections of the stadium and students in the lower section of the student section are asked to wear blue. Fans in odd sections and students in the upper section of the student section are asked to wear gold. The result is the stadium appearing to be "striped" in blue and gold".
Mountaineer Mantrip.
Instituted during the 2011 season by head coach Dana Holgorsen, the Mountaineer Mantrip is a part of West Virginia's gameday traditions and a recognition of the significance of West Virginia's coal industry. The event is named for the shuttle that transports coalminers into and out of an underground mine at the start and end of their shift and takes place at every home game. 
The walk begins when the team is dropped off at the corner of the WVU Medical Center and Don Nehlen Drive prior to game time. They are accompanied by the Mountaineer mascot, the Pride of West Virginia Marching Band, and the Mountaineer cheerleaders. WVU students and fans line the path to create a tunnel-like effect for the passing team members. When the team reaches the east end of Mountaineer Field, they stop to rub a 350-pound mounted chunk of coal donated by Alpha Natural Resources from the Upper Big Branch coal mine.
A new feature at the completion of the Mantrip was introduced during the 2018 season. After players and coaches have reached Mountaineer Field and touched the mounted piece of coal, they turn and wave toward the parents and patients inside WVU Medicine Children's Hospital adjacent to Mountaineer Field. Dana Holgorsen added this portion of the festivity having drawn inspiration from the Kinnick Stadium "Wave".
Logos and uniforms.
Beginning in 1970, the Mountaineers donned the program's first official logo—the WVU "state outline"—on their helmets through the 1979 season and have reintroduced the logo as part of a "throwback" helmet since 2013. West Virginia used a white helmet with the state outline logo from 1970 to 1972, a gold helmet with the same logo from 1973 to 1978, and reverted to the white helmet and state outline logo in 1979 and again in 2013.
The "Flying WV" is the trademark logo for West Virginia Mountaineer football, adorning the team's helmet and uniform. It debuted in 1980 along with the current gold and blue color scheme as a part of a football uniform redesign by head coach Don Nehlen, and has since become one of the most widely recognized logos in collegiate athletics. In adopting the Flying WV logo on the team's helmets, Nehlen wanted to create a distinct image for the football program that could be easily identified. When Nehlen began his tenure as head coach in 1980, he initially had difficulty in distinguishing between WVU and its opponents while watching game film. The logo itself was created by sports artist John Martin, brother of then-Athletic Director Dick Martin. John Martin's primary inspiration for the logo was the depiction of mountains created with the combination of the state initials 'W' and 'V'. The surge in the logo's popularity led to its adoption as the official logo of West Virginia University in 1985.
Since 1980, West Virginia's standard uniform has consisted of a dark blue jersey (home) or a white jersey (away) with gold pants and a dark blue helmet adorned by the gold "Flying WV" logo on both sides. West Virginia's uniform scheme has also included a gold helmet, white helmet, gold jersey, dark blue pants, and white pants at various stages throughout its history. WVU also added a gray uniform and helmet combination to its rotation for the 2012 season.
The Mountaineers wore a Nike Pro Combat uniform or the 2010 season edition of the Backyard Brawl. The uniform was specifically designed to pay tribute to West Virginia's coal mining industry. The jersey and pants consisted of a shade of white accented by a layer of coal dust, along with accents of university gold that referenced canaries utilized in coal mining. The helmet also implemented the coal dust accent, along with a yellow line down the center designed to embody the beam of light emitted by a miner's headlamp. West Virginia also donned the Pro Combat uniforms later that season for the Champs Sports Bowl.
WVU introduced new uniforms for the 2013 season. The helmets, jerseys, and pants featured blue, gold, and white primary color sets, creating 27 different possible uniform combinations. The reintroduction of the gold and white helmets to the uniform scheme marked the first time each have been used since the late 1970s.
All of the helmets featured a matte, non-glossy paint finish and the "Flying WV" logo adorned on each side. WVU introduced a white "throwback" helmet during the 2013 season, utilizing the 1970s "state outline" logo. The West Virginia state motto, Montani Semper Liberi, (“Mountaineers are Always Free”), was stitched inside the back collar of all three jerseys. A canary image was stitched inside the front collar, representative of West Virginia's coal mining heritage for their use in testing toxicity levels in the mines. The jerseys had a unique number style exclusive to WVU, featuring sharp points and edges inspired by a miner's pickaxe.
As of the 2019 season and as part of a larger re-branding of all WVU sports teams, the Mountaineers incorporated new Nike Vapor Untouchable football uniforms. The all-gray alternate uniform also returned to the rotation. West Virginia debuted "Country Roads" uniforms on September 1, 2022, against longtime rival Pitt. The uniforms are inspired by West Virginia's roadways, with interstate maps on the shoulders and yellow striping that resembles center line markings on the helmet.
Rivalries.
Cincinnati.
The football rivalry between West Virginia University and the Cincinnati Bearcats is a regional and conference-driven series that has seen several memorable moments over the decades. The two programs first met in 1921 and played occasionally throughout much of the 20th century, but the rivalry truly gained significance when Cincinnati joined the Big East Conference in 2005. From 2005 to 2011, they faced each other annually, often with conference title implications. WVU dominated the early Big East-era meetings, including a 38–0 shutout in 2005, but Cincinnati turned the tide in 2008 with a 26–23 overtime win. The most notable game came in 2009 when undefeated, fifth-ranked Cincinnati edged WVU 24–21 on their way to a Big East championship and BCS berth. The annual series paused after WVU left for the Big 12 Conference in 2012, while Cincinnati joined the American Athletic Conference. The rivalry was renewed in 2023 when Cincinnati joined the Big 12. Since its renewal, WVU has won both the 2023 and 2024 matchups. The Mountaineers currently lead the series all-time with a 18-3-1 record.
Marshall.
West Virginia played in-state opponent Marshall in the annual Friends of Coal Bowl until 2012. Marshall and WVU first played in 1911, but it wasn't until 2006 before the two schools from the "Mountain State" faced off annually for the Governor's Cup. Some believe the rivalry began due to political pressure from the state government. The two last played in 2012, and there are no immediate plans to renew the rivalry. West Virginia holds a 12–0 lead in the series as of 2012. West Virginia has won all 12 meetings against Marshall.
Maryland.
The Mountaineers and Maryland Terrapins have met on a semi-annual basis since 1919, recently rekindling a cross-border rivalry that was once the longest continuous non-conference series for these geographical neighbors. The Mountaineers lead the series 28–23–2 through the 2021 season.
Penn State.
The series between West Virginia and Penn State has been historically one-sided. The teams met annually from 1947 to 1992. From 1959 to 1983, Penn State had won 25 consecutive meetings between the two. The series ended in 1992 with Penn State commencing Big Ten Conference play in 1993. On September 19, 2013, the schools announced that they would renew the series with two games in 2023 and 2024. Penn State leads the series 48–9–2 through the 2017 season.
Pittsburgh.
In terms of competitiveness, intensity and longevity, the Backyard Brawl with the Pittsburgh Panthers is West Virginia's most fierce and storied rivalry. Separated by only 70 miles, the two universities have competed on a mostly annual basis since 1895 (beginning in 1920 and resuming again in 1943 after World War II). Although Pitt holds a 63–41–3 series lead, more than half of its victories in the Backyard Brawl came prior to 1952 when the Panthers dominated the series 34–9–1. The Mountaineers hold a 26–22–2 edge over the Panthers since 1962 when the series began to interchange annually between Morgantown and Pittsburgh. West Virginia has also won seven of the last ten meetings. After being put on hiatus following the 2011 season due to conference realignment, the series was renewed with four games running from 2022 to 2025 and 2029–2032.
In the first game of the restored Brawl, the Mountaineers lost to the Pittsburgh Panthers by a final score of 38 to 31. The most recent version of the Brawl was held on Saturday, September 24, 2024 and was won by Pittsburgh with a final score of 38–34.
Syracuse.
West Virginia also enjoyed a long-standing rivalry with the Syracuse Orange. The schools competed annually from 1955 to 2012, with the 1993 addition of the Ben Schwartzwalder Trophy being awarded to the victor. The significance of the trophy resides in the fact that Ben Schwartzwalder was a West Virginia native, former WVU player, and head coach at Syracuse. While Syracuse holds a 34–27 lead in the series, WVU won eight of the last ten games between the schools. Much like the status of the Backyard Brawl, Syracuse's departure from the Big East for the Atlantic Coast Conference and WVU's joining of the Big 12 Conference casts doubt over the future of the series.
Virginia Tech.
The Mountaineers also enjoy a fierce rivalry with their Appalachia counterparts, the Virginia Tech Hokies. The schools once competed on an annual basis from 1973 to 2005, doing so as Big East Conference rivals starting in 1991. Beginning in 1997, West Virginia and Virginia Tech competed for the Black Diamond Trophy, symbolizing the Appalachian region's rich coal heritage. While West Virginia held a 28–22–1 advantage in the series, Virginia Tech won nine of the last 12 meetings between the schools. Since the Hokies departed the Big East for the ACC in 2004 and ended the series in 2006, the rivalry has been dormant. The rivalry was renewed with a neutral-site game in 2017, then was played in Morgantown in 2021 and was played in Blacksburg in the 2022 season. West Virginia leads the series with Virginia Tech 30–23–1 through the 2022 season.

Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees.
Three Mountaineers hold the distinguished title of Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees.
Joe Stydahar, an offensive tackle, was inducted in 1967. Despite Stydahar's impressive collegiate career, Chicago Bears owner/coach George Halas took a chance in selecting the little-known tackle with the Bears' first ever draft selection in the 1936 NFL draft. Halas's gamble paid off as "Jumbo Joe" produced an illustrious playing career with the Bears, earning four NFL All-Star selections, six All-Pro selections, three NFL championships, and an induction into the NFL's All-Decade Team for the 1930s. Stydahar also served as head coach of the Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Cardinals, winning the 1951 NFL Championship with the Rams. During his Hall of Fame enshrinement speech, Stydahar thanked his family and friends from his "dear state, West Virginia."
Sam Huff, a linebacker, was inducted in 1982. Originally a third round selection by the New York Giants in the 1956 NFL draft, Huff played for the Giants from 1956 to 1963 and later for the Washington Redskins from 1964 to 1969. Huff's football career, let alone his future in the NFL, almost never came to pass, however. When Huff was a junior in high school, WVU head coach Art Lewis came to his town to look at another prospect and recruited Huff instead. At the end of Huff's collegiate career Giants scout Al DeRogatis came to Morgantown to look at All-American guard Bruce Bosley. DeRogatis instead discovered Huff, proclaiming that "there's another guard here who will be even greater. His name is Sam Huff." Huff became a five-time Pro Bowl selection, a four-time First-Team All-Pro selection, an inductee in the NFL 1950s All-Decade Team, and was named as one of the 70 Greatest Redskins of all time. Huff was also recognized as the NFL's Top Linebacker in 1959.
Chuck Howley, a linebacker, was inducted in 2023. Selected by the Chicago Bears seventh overall in the 1958 NFL draft, he played for the Bears from 1958 to 1959, before briefly retiring from football, then returning to play for the Dallas Cowboys and played the remainder of his career for them. An original member of the Doomsday Defense, Howley received six Pro Bowl and five first-team All-Pro selections with the Cowboys, while appearing in two consecutive Super Bowls and winning Super Bowl VI. Howley was also named the MVP of Super Bowl V and is the only player on a losing team to receive the award.

Lumbosacral trunk

The lumbosacral trunk is nervous tissue that connects the lumbar plexus with the sacral plexus. It is formed by the union of parts of the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves and descends to join the sacral plexus.
Anatomy.
The lumbosacral trunk is formed by the union of the entire anterior ramus of lumbar nerve L5 . L4 first issues its branches to the lumbar plexus, then emerges from the medial border of the psoas muscle to unite with the anterior ramus of L5 just superior to the pelvic brim to form the thick, cord-like trunk which crosses the pelvic brim (medial to the obturator nerve) to descend upon the anterior surface of the ala of sacrum before joining the sacral plexus.
Like the sacral nerves, the lumbosacral trunks splits into an anterior division and a posterior division before recombining to form nerves for the flexor and extensor compartments of the lower limb.
Clinical significance.
The lumbosacral trunk may be compressed by the fetal head during the second stage of labour. This causes some muscle weakness in the legs. A full recovery is usually expected.

Sittin' Pretty (The Pastels album)

Sittin' Pretty is the second album by the Scottish band the Pastels, released in 1989.
Critical reception.
"Trouser Press" wrote that "while there's nothing new in "Sittin' Pretty"'s off-key awkwardness and gawky grooves (for the first time, the Pastels sound like they're consciously trying to sound like themselves), this outing from the monsters of twee is not without its gems." "The New York Times" wrote that the album "has melodies as simple as nursery rhymes, cut to shreds by brazen, bullying guitar solos." Martin C. Strong wrote that the album "featured some of the sweetest, juiciest moments in The Pastels' chequered career." "The Herald" called the album "a small but perfectly formed eccentricity in which the spirits of Iggy Pop, Jonathan Richman, and the Velvet Underground combine in wistful splendour."

Frederick Henry Baddeley

Major General Frederick Henry Baddeley (4 December 1794 – 4 May 1879), born Frederick Henry "Clinton-"Baddeley, youngest son of Sir Henry Clinton and his partner, Mary Baddeley (1756 – 27 March 1820),&lt;ref name="PROB 11/1271/91"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was a British military engineer of the Corps of Royal Engineers with his early service being in the Napoleonic wars including the capture of Paris in 1815. He then did a tour in the West Indies from 1817 to 1819, and in 1821 was assigned to Quebec City in Lower Canada.
Most of his important work in Canada had to do with the geology of much of southeastern Canada. British military officers, and Baddeley being considered one of the best, did extensive geological studies of this huge area. His tour in Canada ended in 1839 and during his stay in Canada, he pioneered a valuable body of geological and other engineering work.
Baddeley served as Commanding Royal Engineer in New Zealand from September 1853 to February 1856, and was promoted to colonel on 28 November 1854. In 1855 he superintended the construction of the Marsland Hill barracks, New Plymouth.

Marlon Green

Marlon Dewitt Green (June 6, 1929 – July 6, 2009) was an African-American pilot whose landmark United States Supreme Court decision in 1963 helped dismantle racial discrimination in the American passenger airline industry.
The decision led to David E. Harris's hiring as the first African-American pilot for a major airline the following year. Green was subsequently hired by Continental Airlines, for whom he flew from 1965 to 1978.
Biography.
Marlon Green is born in El Dorado, Arkansas. His father, Mckinley Green, was born in 1900, and married Green's mother, Lucy, on April 10, 1921. 
In 1936 or 1937, the family moved to Lansing, Michigan, where he found work at the Drop Forge Company. He later joined the household staff of dentist J. Shelton Rushing as what his son called the major domo. Green converted to Catholicism in the 11th grade and attended Xavier University Preparatory School in New Orleans before studying to become a priest with the Josephites at Epiphany Apostolic College. He was eventually dismissed.
Marlon Green joined the United States Air Force, where his last posting was flying the SA-16 Albatross with the 36th Air Rescue Squadron at Johnson Air Base in Tokyo, Japan. While on leave in 1957, he applied for a pilot position with Continental Airlines, and was invited to be interviewed after having left blank the racial-identity question on the application. He also omitted pasting into the small square block provided in the upper right hand corner of the first page of the application, a picture of himself, Five other white applicants, less qualified, were hired. Per varying sources, he either was rejected then, or was hired as what would have been the nation's first African-American pilot for a major commercial airline, but was rejected after reporting for orientation. On April 22, 1963, following oral arguments on March 28, 1963, the United States Supreme Court ruled in "Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission v. Continental Airlines, Inc. 372 U.S. 714 no. 146" that Green had been unlawfully discriminated against. In 1964, American Airlines hired David E. Harris as the first African-American pilot for major US passenger airline. 
Following his Supreme Court victory, Green flew for Continental from 1965 to 1978, initially piloting Vickers Viscounts out of Denver. He became a captain in 1966.
Green died aged 80 in Denver, Colorado.
Personal life.
He was divorced at the time of his death and was survived by his six children, one of whom is the historian Monica Green. 
Legacy.
On February 16, 2010, at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, Continental Airlines named a Boeing 737-824 (N77518, cn 31605) after him.
During his lifetime, Green was inducted into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame.

At the time of its grand opening 42 students and 8 faculty occupied the lot. The first principal was Cathy Grunlund. Over the summer of 2006 the school relocated and currently operates on a parcel. There are approximately 310 enrolled students and 65 faculty offering instruction from Jr. Kindergarten for 3-year-olds to Grade 12. The school is accredited as an International Baccalaureate World School and offers the IB Primary Years, IB Middle Years and IB Diploma programme and received a 10 out of 10 by the IB Organization (IBO) in 2011.
Legal issues.
In 2023, the former head of Aspengrove was banned from teaching for 15 years after, in August 2022, he sent sexually explicit messages to and attempted to meet up with someone he believed to be 15 years old. That person was actually an adult vigilante posing as an underaged youth in order to catch predators in what is known as a "creep catcher" sting operation. After a video of the attempted meet-up and screenshots of their online conversations were posted to a Facebook group and the school became aware of the incident, the school fired Pierotti and reported him to the Commissioner for Teacher Regulation, as per the Independent Schools Act.

Tommy de la Cruz

Tomás de la Cruz Rivero (September 18, 1911 – September 6, 1958) was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the Cincinnati Reds in 1944. The 32-year-old rookie was a native of Marianao, Cuba; he played from 1934 to 1947 in the winter Cuban League and from 1945 to 1948 in the Mexican League. In 1960, he was elected to the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame.
Playing career.
De la Cruz is one of many ballplayers who only appeared in the major leagues during World War II. He was a very effective pitcher for the Reds in his one big league season. His major league debut was on April 20, 1944, which was the third game on the schedule. He was the starting pitcher and winner in a 2–1 victory over the Chicago Cubs at Crosley Field.
On September 16, de la Cruz pitched a one-hitter—the first ever pitched in the major leagues by a Latin American pitcher—against the Pittsburgh Pirates, winning 2–1.
He was a versatile hurler for Cincinnati, as he completed nine of 20 starts and appeared 14 times in relief. As a reliever he finished ten games and saved one other. For the year he was 9–9 with a 3.25 earned run average, and finished in the league's top ten in four important pitching categories, including WHIP (1.124). He was also a good fielder, committing just one error the entire season.
During the winter, de la Cruz was called up for U.S. military service, but instead enlisted in the Cuban army. With reports that he would not be permitted to return to the United States until after the war, he decided to play in the Mexican League. Pitching for México, de la Cruz went 17–11 with a 2.26 earned run average. He continued to play in Mexican League during 1945–48 and had a career record there of 40–26 with a 2.60 earned run average. Because Major League Baseball designated the Mexican League as an "outlaw league," he was banned for five years from returning to organized baseball.
In his native Cuba, de la Cruz pitched in the winter Cuban League from 1934/35 to 1946/47, with a career record of 71–78. In 1947, the Cuban League agreed to affiliate with U.S. organized baseball, leaving de la Cruz and many other banned Cuban players ineligible to return to the Cuban League. De la Cruz was the leader of the players' union ("Asociación Nacional de Peloteros Profesionales de Cuba") and organized an alternative league, the Liga Nacional (or Players Federation League) in which the banned players could compete. While the quality of play was high, the league was a financial failure and lasted only one winter, 1947/48.
De la Cruz died at the age of 46 in Havana, Cuba.

Georgia State Route 337

State Route 337 (SR 337) is a state highway that travels southwest-to-northeast in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. It travels from the Alabama state line southwest of Menlo, where the roadway continues as Cherokee County Road 99, northeastward through Broomtown Valley at the foot of Lookout Mountain. The route reaches its northern terminus at US 27/SR 1 south of LaFayette, though the route previously terminated in LaFayette.
Route description.
SR 337 begins at the Alabama state line, southwest of Menlo, where the roadway continues as Cherokee County Route 99 (CR 99). SR 337 travels northeast to Menlo, where it has an intersection with SR 48. After leaving Menlo, SR 337 travels to the northeast through rural areas of Chattooga and Walker counties. Approximately after the intersection with South Industrial Loop, the highway enters the southwestern part of the city limits of LaFayette. In town, the route turns right onto North Industrial Loop, then left onto Shattuck Industrial Boulevard. At the intersection with Foster Mill Drive, SR 337 leaves the city limits of LaFayette. The highway curves to the southeast and meeting its northern terminus, an intersection with US 27/SR 1 (South Main Street) south of the city.
SR 337 is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.
History.
SR 337 was established between 1960 and 1963. It entered the state farther to the north than it currently does, traveling along Jamestown Road, and through the western part of Menlo; then, it continued to LaFayette as it does today. By 1966, it was rerouted to the east, through Menlo, along Edison Street, and turned northeast at Mitchell Road. By 1978, the highway was rerouted in Menlo, to follow 7th Avenue and Menlo–LaFayette Road, as it does today. In 1988, SR 337 was rerouted throughout the southern part of LaFayette, along its current routing.

Ontario Labour Relations Board

The Ontario Labour Relations Board is an adjudicative agency of the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development and was established by the Ontario government in 1948. It defines itself as "an independent, quasi-judicial tribunal mandated to mediate and adjudicate a variety of employment and labour relations-related matters under a number of Ontario statutes". Its current (2022) chair is Brian O'Byrne.
Role.
The Board deals with many types of applications relating to labour relations within the province of Ontario. Most cases at the OLRB involve either the Labour Relations Act, the Occupational Health and Safety Act, or the Employment Standards Act. One of the most important powers of the Ontario Labour Relations Board is the ability to certify trade unions as collective bargaining agents. The Board is also in charge of the union formation, termination and decertification. It also commonly deals with claims of unfair labour practices, occupational health and safety reprisals, duty of fair representation cases, and construction industry grievances, among others.
Location.
The Ontario Labour Relations Board is located at 505 University Ave. Toronto, Ontario.
Decisions.
Decisions issued by the OLRB are made available on CanLII and commercial legal databases. All reported OLRB decisions back to 1944 are available in the Ontario Workplace Tribunal Library.
Library.
The Ontario Workplace Tribunals Library (OWTL) is attached to the Ontario Labour Relations Board and is open to the public. The library collects and organizes materials related to workplace health and safety, human rights/discrimination, pay equity, labour relations and employment law, administrative law and other related subjects. In addition to the Board, the Library provides services to the staff of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal.
The library also holds the OLRB collection of bargaining unit certificates issued from 1962 to the present. Certificates issued from 2007 onward are available on the OWTL website.
Publications.
The Ontario Labour Relations Board publishes an annual report, bi-monthly reports of significant decisions and a monthly publication of summaries of significant decisions called “Highlights”.
Support to other Agencies and Commissions.
In 2008, by the signing of their respective Memoranda of Understanding with the Ministry of Labour, the Board assumed administrative oversight over the Pay Equity Hearings Tribunal. The PEHT has its own OIC appointees (many of whom are cross-appointed from the Board), but relies on the Board for all its administrative and legal support.

Angus Dun

Angus Dun (May 4, 1892 – August 12, 1971) was a noted United States clergyman and author, who was the 4th Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington in Washington, DC.
Life and work.
Early life.
Angus Dun, son of Henry W. and Sarah R. (Hazard) Dun, was born in New York City. His father was associated with a cousin, Robert G. Dun, in the credit-rating firm of R. G. Dun &amp; Co., which later merged to become Dun &amp; Bradstreet. He was born with deformed hands and feet, and spent most of his childhood shuttling from hospital to hospital. At the age of 11, he was paralyzed by polio. Complications led to the amputation of one of his legs. Despite his handicaps, he prepared for college at The Albany Academy in Albany, New York. He graduated from Yale University in 1914 with a BA degree. At Yale, he was a member of Elihu and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Religion had been a casual interest for him until, while at Yale, he came under the influence of Dr. Henry B. Wright, Professor of Theology. Although he had grown up in the Dutch Reformed Church, he joined the Episcopal Church and decided to become a priest. He graduated from Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1917 with a Bachelor of Sacred Theology (S.T.B.) degree. He was ordained a deacon on May 17, 1917, and a priest on November 20, 1917, by the Right Rev. William Lawrence, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. He was married to Catherine Whipple Pew, daughter of Brig. Gen. William A. and Alice (Huntington) Pew of Salem, Massachusetts, on June 22, 1916, in Salem. They had two sons.
Vicar and professor.
Soon after graduating from Episcopal Theological School, he became vicar at St. Andrew's Church in Ayer, Massachusetts, and of its mission in Forge Village (now St. Mark's Church in Westford, Massachusetts). The nature of his work here was altered by the fact that the United States had declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917. Several miles from the church, of wood lots and fields were almost immediately transformed into a complete city for 10,000 men with barracks and training buildings, named Camp Devens, later known as Fort Devens. Construction, commenced on June 19 by the largest labor force ever assembled in the United States, raced at the rate of 10.4 new buildings every day. By September 4, the military base was ready and the first draft inductees arrived. On September 15, 1917, the Reverend Angus Dun and the Reverend Dr. Endicott Peabody, headmaster at Groton School, conducted the first services, sponsored by the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), for the newly arrived men. In the course of the first year, over 60,000 inductees were processed. Rev. Dun's principal work was as a civilian chaplain to the service men; the parish assisted him as they could. During the war, union services of the Federated, Unitarian, and St. Andrew's parishes were held at the YMCA on West Main Street in Ayer. After what must been an exhausting year and a half as vicar, he left in the spring of 1919 to continue his studies at the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh.
From 1920 to 1940, he was an instructor, assistant professor and professor of theology at Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From 1940 to 1944, he was dean of the School. He was known for his very strong pacifist views. In a November 1922 sermon he stated, "The time may come when patriotism and Christ will stand face to face and men will have to choose which they will follow. If the Christian Church does not develop men with the courage to choose Christ, mankind will find no abiding peace and the church will lose its soul." He was also known for his distinctly Modernist beliefs. In January 1924, he co-signed a letter sent to alumni of the Episcopal Theological School proposing that the creeds be reconsidered—"The Church is greater than the creeds. The central faith in God as He is found in Christ, upon which the Church is built, is not destroyed or diminished by doubts concerning the method of Christ's birth, of His return to God or His future judgement. The Church made the creeds. The creeds did not make the Church."
Bishop.
On November 23, 1943, the Very Rev. Angus Dun was elected the fourth Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington on the third ballot. He was consecrated at Washington National Cathedral on April 19, 1944, in a service led by 10 bishops, including the Archbishop of York. It was the first time since 1871 that an English bishop had participated in an American consecration. In his inaugural sermon, he decried Americans' "lofty moral tone" and preached that patriotism and nationalism could be "evil" if not bound to God as well as the country. He would later continue that theme, clashing with President Truman at a retreat and saying that the Christian faith could not be "mobilized by political leadership for political ends, however good."
Only one year after his consecration, he officiated the brief funeral of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
During the 18 years of his episcopate, Bishop Dun confirmed more than 31,000 people, ordained 105 deacons and 91 priests, and visited two and sometimes three parishes every Sunday. Most important, he was a strong proponent of the ecumenical movement. He served for 10 years on the Central Committee of World Council of Churches, founded in Amsterdam in 1948. He was named an Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. He retired from his position as bishop on May 6, 1962, at the age of 70.
Death and tributes.
The Right Rev. Angus Dun died on August 12, 1971, in Washington, D.C. Funeral services were held at the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in Washington, D.C., where a delegation of eight bishops, including the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. John E. Hines, led the clerical and lay mourners. His ashes were later interred in a niche in the wall of Bethlehem Chapel in the cathedral. The carved inscription reads:
In an editorial about his life, "The Washington Post" wrote:
Books.
He was the author of nine books, including "King's Cross: Meditations on the Seven Last Words" (1926), "Meanings of Unity" (1937), "Studies in Church Unity" (1938), "We Believe: A Simple Exposition of the Creeds" (1938), "Not By Bread Alone." (1942), "Prospecting for A United Church" (1948) and "The Saving Person" (1957).

Junoon (Junoon album)

Junoon (Urdu: جنون, literal English translation: "obsession/passion") is the debut album of the Pakistani sufi rock band Junoon, released on 30 September 1992. It was released by EMI and recorded at the EMI studios in Karachi in 1990. The album is produced by founder, songwriter and lead guitarist Salman Ahmad. The album contained a total track list of twelve songs with eight tracks being in Urdu language, three tracks in English and one instrumental.
All songs on the album were recorded with Ali Azmat on vocals with the exception of "Khwab" and "Jiyain", which were recorded with Nusrat Hussain on vocals and the track "Jogia" featured female vocals by Fifi Haroon. Session player Asad Ahmed featured on bass guitar, on all tracks in the album.
Junoon's debut album was sponsored by Colgate in promotion of the band and was sold free with every Colgate toothpaste purchase in Pakistan, when released in 1992.
Conception.
Background.
Junoon's roots stretch back to Tappan, New York, in the 1970s. Salman Ahmad left Lahore, Pakistan, for New York with his family when he was eleven, and received his baptism in rock music when a friend offered him a ticket to a Led Zeppelin concert. Salman Ahmad was so enthralled by the show that he saved $235 to buy his own electric guitar. He also befriended Brian O'Connell in Tappan, another young aspiring musician, with whom Ahmad formed their first band together by the name of "Eclipse". Before the two friends could take their aspirations out of the basement and onto a bigger stage, Salman Ahmad's parents moved back to Pakistan in 1981, and Salman began to study medicine at Lahore's King Edward's Medical College.
In 1987, Nusrat Hussain, by then the lead guitarist of the band Vital Signs, after composing the song "Dil Dil Pakistan", parted ways with Vital Signs and suggested Rohail Hyatt, founder and keyboardist of Vital Signs, to bring Salman Ahmad as his replacement in the band. Vital Signs then went on to record their debut album at the EMI Studios in Karachi, but almost all the songs were written and composed at Salman Ahmad's residence where the band had been lodged. In March 1989, the band released their debut album, "Vital Signs 1", which was a success throughout the country. The following year, Salman Ahmad parted ways with the most successful pop band of Pakistan as he wanted a change in the band's music for their second album and therefore after leaving the band he went on to form his own band. First, he recruited singer Ali Azmat from the Jupiters and then the former Vital Signs lead guitarist, Nusrat Hussain, on keyboards.
Junoon formed in 1990 when Salman Ahmad, founder, songwriter and lead guitarist, had a dream where one of his teachers shook him and said "Tumhey mousiqui ka Junoon hai!" (You have an obsession for music!). After the band's formation, its members were signed to major record label EMI Records and afterwards went on recording their self-titled debut album. The album features the emerging alternative rock instrumentation of the time, as well more palatable hard rock and AOR influences.
Release and promotion.
Junoon were not an over night success, the band members struggled for the first few years. Their self-titled debut album, recorded at the EMI Studios in Karachi barely made a dent in the Pakistani music industry when released on 30 September 1991. The band's debut album was sponsored by Colgate in promotion of the band and was sold free with every Colgate toothpaste purchase in Pakistan, when released in 1991. After the release of their debut album, Nusrat Hussain parted ways with the band to pursue his own career as a solo singer and went on to release his debut solo album "Amrit" in 1992.
Singles that performed well at the local music charts were "Neend Athi Nahin", "Jiyain" and "Chori Chori". Although a few singles from the album did pretty well at the local music charts, however, the album failed to make an impact in the Pakistani music industry. Pakistani Muziq Channel gave the album a 3.0/5.0 rating upon its release.

Greg Sutton (soccer)

Gregory Sutton (born April 19, 1977) is a Canadian former soccer player and broadcaster. He played as a goalkeeper for several A-League and Major League Soccer teams, including the Montreal Impact and Toronto FC, as well as the Canada national team.
Playing career.
Youth and college.
Sutton was born in Canada, but spent a good part of his adolescence playing soccer in Bethel, Connecticut, United States, where his father was transferred as part of his employment. He played college soccer at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York.
Professional.
During the 2003 season, Sutton helped the Montreal Impact become the USL squad with the lowest goals allowed total and won the Goalkeeper of the Year honor. He had a league-leading 0.73 goals-against average and the most minutes in goal in the league (2463). During the 2004 season with the Impact, the team won the A-League.
On November 29, 2006, Sutton returned to MLS, having been allocated to the newly formed Toronto FC for the 2007 season. Sutton was the team's starting goalkeeper until he received a head concussion during CONCACAF Gold Cup training with Canada in June. Since a team doctor did not accompany the Canadian squad, he was cleared by a local physician and later suffered from post-concussion syndrome as a result, ruling him out of play for the rest of the year.
Sutton was dropped for the 2008 season opener in favour of draft pick Brian Edwards, but made his return against D.C. United at RFK Stadium in Toronto's second game. He conceded four goals but made a number of important saves. He retained his position for the next three games, recording three straight shutouts in April. He was named to the 2008 Inactive All Star Roster for his strong performance in the first half of the 2008 season. On June 9, 2009, Sutton was released by Toronto FC, to make room for the acquisition of Nick Garcia.
On March 11, 2010, it was announced that Sutton had signed with the New York Red Bulls. On April 27, 2010, Sutton officially debuted for New York in a 2–1 victory over Philadelphia Union in a 2010 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup qualification match. On August 11, 2010, Sutton made his league debut for New York recording a 1–0 shutout over his former club Toronto FC.
Sutton began the 2011 Major League Soccer season as New York's starting goalkeeper helping the club to a 1–0 victory over Seattle Sounders FC on March 19, 2011. After the signing of German goalkeeper Frank Rost, Sutton was loaned out to Canadian North American Soccer League team Montreal Impact on July 16, 2011. As part of the loan agreement, Montreal was given the option to acquire Sutton's MLS rights at the end of the season as the club prepared for a move to MLS in 2012. Montreal exercised this option for Sutton's rights but then declined his 2012 contract option, making him eligible for the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Sutton came to terms on a new agreement with Montreal Impact on December 9, 2011. On October 29, 2012, Sutton announced his retirement from professional soccer after a 14-year career.
International.
Sutton made his Canada national team debut on January 18, 2004, against Barbados. He was invited to the men's World Cup team development camp in July 2004 against Hearts and helped his side to a 1–1 draw. Sutton earned his second senior cap and kept a clean sheet against Northern Ireland in February 2005 in a 1–0 win. On January 18 of that year he was called up to the national team roster once again. Sutton competed in the last three Gold Cups and most recently helping Canada reach the Quarterfinals of the 2009 Gold Cup.
Coaching career.
From 2002 to 2003, Sutton was an assistant coach with the University de Montreal Carabins.
On May 7, 2013, it was announced that Sutton would become the head coach of the Concordia|University's men's soccer team. He had been an assistant coach with the team since 2011. In August 2018 Sutton was also named head coach of Concordia University women's soccer program.
Broadcasting career.
Sutton was a match analyst for TSN from 2013 to 2022, primarily covering MLS matches. He joined the commentary team for Apple TV's MLS Season Pass in 2023.

Georgia State Route 334

State Route 334 (SR 334) is a south-to-north state highway located entirely within Jackson County in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. It travels from north of Athens to Commerce. It is effectively an alternate route of U.S. Route 441 (US 441).
Route description.
SR 334 begins at an intersection with US 441/SR 15 north of Athens. Past this intersection is a segment of the former route of US 441. The highway travels east-northeast and curves to the north-northeast through generally rural parts of the county. Just south of Seagraves Mill Road, it begins to curve to the northwest. In the southern part of Commerce, it intersects a local street named Allen Road then becomes the route along that street. It then has another intersection with US 441/SR 15. This intersection also marks the southern terminus of US 441 Bus., which travels concurrent with SR 334. Approximately later, they intersect SR 98. Here, SR 334 ends, and US 441 BUS/SR 98 have a concurrency.
SR 334 is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.
History.
In the early 1960s, SR 334 was built, and paved, from its southern terminus, southeast of Center, to the southern part of Commerce (the current intersection with US 441/SR 15 and US 441 Bus.) In 1991, US 441/SR 15 were rerouted through the Commerce area. Part of the former route was redesignated as US 441 Bus., with SR 334 concurrent with it.

Inquilaab (album)

Inquilaab (Urdu: انقلاب, literal English translation: "revolution") is the third studio album and the fourth overall album of the Pakistani band Junoon. Although previous albums by Junoon also achieved considerable success, 'Inquilaab' contained the band's first major hit, the patriotic song "Jazba-e-Junoon". The album also contained the hit "Saeein," which marked Junoon's foray into what later became the sufi rock sound that Junoon is most popularly associated with. Other hits from the album were "Mera Mahi" and "Husan Walo".
Background.
Inquilaab was the first hit album by the Pakistani rock band Junoon, released in 1996. It was also the album which marked the beginning of a new genre of Pakistani music that Junoon pioneered - sufi rock, which later on became the genre that Junoon is widely recognized by. The track "Saeein" on the album is Junoon's venture into sufi rock.
The album's only single, "Jazba-e-Junoon" was a huge success all over the country and was the band's first big hit. The single topped through the music charts and began Junoon's dominance in the Pakistani music industry.
It was the first album in which Junoon developed a nationwide fan following, blending rock guitars and bluesy vocals with eastern elements like the use of tablas (traditional south Asian hand drums), raga-inspired melodies, traditional Pakistani folk music, and Eastern inspired poetry.

Vancouver Complication

Vancouver Complication is a compilation album featuring many influential Vancouver punk bands. It was released in 1979 on Pinned Records, and has been reissued a number of times with several different cover designs.
Considered one of the most important Canadian punk rock albums, the album was compiled by Grant McDonagh, who would later become one of the founders of Zulu Records. Most tracks were recorded at the Sabre Sound studio in Vancouver; for some bands, their contributions to the album were their first and/or only time recording material in a studio.
Reissue.
The album was reissued in compact disc format in 2005, on Joe Keithley's Sudden Death Records. The CD reissue's liner notes acknowledged that the 1978 Akron, Ohio punk compilation "The Akron Compilation" was one of McDonagh's key inspirations for compiling and releasing the album.
The CD reissue was marked by a release party at Vancouver's Wise Hall, featuring performances by many of the bands on the compilation. In 2011, Sudden Death Records announced a special project, donating all proceeds from sales of the album during the Christmas retail season to the Vancouver Food Bank.
Critical response.
Writing for "Exclaim!", Sam Sutherland stated that "a better snapshot of the beginnings of Canada's fertile West Coast punk scene does not exist." For AllMusic, Ned Raggett noted that some of the bands on the compilation sounded derivative of the more established punk rock scenes in London and New York City, but praised other bands with "other less straitjacketed ways around punk inspirations" for producing "lasting winners", and called the overall album "a classic late-'70s punk-era city-scene survey".
Track listing.
The 2005 CD reissue included five bonus tracks, taken from the original recording sessions but not included on the original 1979 album:

John Moe

John Moe (born 1968) is an American writer and radio personality. He is the author of several books and host of the Depresh Mode and Sleeping with Celebrities podcasts. Originally an actor and playwright, he was a senior editor at Amazon.com, starting their electronic greeting card service and editing their toys site. He worked as a host, producer, and announcer at KUOW, Seattle's NPR station, and then at American Public Media hosting national radio programs and podcasts from 2007 until 2020. Since that time, he has been an independent podcast host and producer, working with the Maximum Fun network.
Early life.
The youngest of four children of Erling Moe, a freight dispatcher, and Aase Moe, a registered nurse, John Moe grew up in Federal Way, Washington and graduated from Federal Way High School. He graduated from Whitman College with a degree in Dramatic Arts in 1990. He was elected by his class to speak at their graduation. While in college, Moe hosted radio shows, wrote a humor column for the student newspaper, acted in several plays, and won the school's first annual one-act play writing contest.
Career.
After his education was completed, Moe was a traveling actor and director with Missoula Children's Theatre before moving to Seattle. There he acted in several fringe theater productions in the nineties and served as an understudy in productions at Seattle Repertory Theater. Eventually, his interest turned to writing and he wrote plays that were performed around Seattle. His musical, "The Big Time", co-written with Chris Ballew of The Presidents of the United States of America, was performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In 1998, he was hired as a Senior Editor at Amazon.com.

Moe was the host and producer of "The Works", a weekly interview program which focused on business and technology. Moe also hosted "The Power of Voice", a weekly listener call-in show on local and national issues. He had been working for two and a half years as a host and producer when he became the senior staff reporter and permanent fill-in host with "Weekend America".
On August 16, 2008, he became host of the problem, replacing Bill Radke and Desiree Cooper, who became a senior correspondent for "Weekend America". Moe developed and wrote the weekly segment "A Little Bit of Weather Everywhere", presenting unique events happening around the country, and the weather for the day at these events.
After the cancellation of Weekend America, Moe became the host of American Public Media's "Future Tense" on May 3, 2010. On Monday, September 20, 2010, "Future Tense" changed its name to "Marketplace Tech Report" as it became part of the "Marketplace" portfolio of programs. On September 10, 2012, Moe left "Marketplace Tech Report" to devote his full-time attention to hosting the radio variety show "Wits". "Wits" was a stage and radio show performed in the Fitzgerald Theater. It began in 2010, and a podcast was created in 2012. The show consists of interviews, comedic sketches, musical performances, and a game show between the two guests, who have included George Takei, Maria Bamford, David Cross, and Neil Gaiman.
When Wits ended, Moe turned his attention to creating and hosting podcasts.
Writing.
Moe is the author of "The Hilarious World of Depression", published in 2020, a memoir of his experiences with major depressive disorder. The book chronicles the development of the illness, the suicide of Moe’s brother Rick, and the development of the podcast of the same name.
Moe is the author of "Dear Luke, We Need To Talk, Darth: and Other Pop Culture Correspondences", published in June 2014. The book is a compilation of fictitious letters, notes, and messages based around familiar songs, movies, TV shows, and sporting events.

His work has appeared in the McSweeney's anthologies "Created in Darkness by Troubled Americans", "The McSweeney's Joke Book of Book Jokes", and "Mountain Man Dance Moves". He has also written for The New York Times Magazine, Reader's Digest, AARP, The Seattle Times, The Minneapolis Star Tribune, and the Seattle Weekly.
He is also the author of "Pop Song Correspondences," a feature on the McSweeney's website, which also became a recurring segment on the "Wits" radio show. Moe has performed selections from "Pop Song Correspondences" at Seattle's Bumbershoot festival.
Podcasts.
In June 2015, Moe along with rapper Open Mike Eagle launched "Conversation Parade", a podcast in which the two discuss the Cartoon Network animated series "Adventure Time".

The Hilarious World of Depression won the Webby Award for Best Comedy Podcast in 2017 and led to Moe's book of the same name. The show ended in June 2020 as Moe was laid off from American Public Media amid the growing pandemic.
Moe began the "Depresh Mode" podcast in March 2021 as part of the Maximum Fun network. It follows a similar format to the previous show and again focuses on long-form interviews, often with creative artists and public figures telling stories of their own mental health struggles. Guests have included Jamie Lee Curtis, David Sedaris, and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The show's episode with actor Joel Kim Booster talking about his active depression led to an LA Press Club award.
Moe created "Sleeping with Celebrities," a comedy and sleep aid podcast, in February 2023.
Moe created but did not host the podcast "You Are Not Alone: Voices of Recovery" for the National Alliance on Mental Illness and won multiple awards for "Our Whitman, My Story", a promotional podcast for Whitman College.
Personal life.

Police Executive Research Forum

The Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) is a national membership organization of police executives primarily from the largest city, county and state law enforcement agencies in the United States. The organization is dedicated to improving policing and advancing professionalism through research and involvement in public policy debate. Since its founding in 1976 with support and funding from the Police Foundation, it has fostered debate, research and an openness to challenging traditional police practices. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C.
PERF members must have completed a 4-year college degree program.
Established in 1976, PERF's primary sources of operating revenues are tuition payments for educational programs, grants from private and nonprofit organizations, membership dues, and government contracts.
Since 2014, PERF has focused on developing policies and training programs to minimize police use of lethal force, particularly in situations involving persons with mental illness, developmental disabilities, drug addictions, or other conditions that can cause them to behave erratically or dangerously, and in situations where the subject does not have a firearm.
PERF also has released a series of reports describing and advocating the increasing role of local law enforcement agencies in addressing the opioid epidemic, by actively helping addicted persons to get treatment and other services, while saving lives by providing naloxone to officers so they can help prevent fatal overdoses.
PERF also has reported on police leaders’ approach to immigration issues and has researched police programs to welcome refugees to American communities. Another area of focus has been reducing gender bias in the police response to sexual assault and domestic violence and expanding the FBI’s definition of rape to more accurately report levels of crime.
Since 2013, PERF also has issued reports on building trust between police and community members; reducing gun violence; advancing Constitutional policing; recommendations on body-worn camera programs; changes in marijuana laws; the role of local police in preventing cybercrime; the police response to active shooter incidents; legitimacy and procedural justice in policing; social media in policing; and civil rights investigations of local police agencies.
In 2007, PERF made news by reporting that violent crime had risen by double-digit percentages in cities across the country between 2005 and 2007. This claim was disputed at the time but the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics show an increase in violent crime in 2005-2006 amid an otherwise consistent decrease between 1994 and 2009.
PERF organized conference calls with city police chiefs to discuss their response to the Occupy Wall Street movement during the Fall of 2011.

Miriwoong, also written Miriuwung and Miriwung, is an Aboriginal Australian language which today has fewer than 20 fluent speakers, most of whom live in or near Kununurra in Western Australia. All of the fluent speakers are elderly and the Miriwoong language is considered to be critically endangered. However, younger generations tend to be familiar with a lot of Miriwoong vocabulary which they use when speaking Kimberley Kriol or Aboriginal English, and there is active language revitalization.
Country.
Ancestral Miriwoong territory covered an estimated and extended from the valley of the Ord River north to Carlton Hill Station, upstream to Ivanhoe Station, and east to Newry Station, and along the Keep River to near the coastal swamps.
Linguo-genetic categorisation.
Miriwoong is categorised by linguists as a Non-Pama-Nyungan language and part of the Jarrakan subgroup.
Sign.
As is common in many Australian language communities, the Miriwoong people have a signed language that is used in addition to the spoken languages of the community.
Multilingualism.
Despite the endangered status of the Miriwoong language, the Miriwoong community is vibrantly multilingual. Languages spoken include Miriwoong (for a small number of speakers), the Miriwoong signed language, Kimberley Kriol, and English. Two varieties of English are present in the community, Aboriginal English, and Standard Australian English. Many speakers are bi-dialectical in both varieties while many others have a strong preference for Aboriginal English.
Mirima Dawang Woorlab-gerring.
The Mirima Dawang Woorlab-gerring Language and Culture Centre has been tasked with the preservation and revitalisation of the Miriwoong language since the 1970s.
MDWg engages in a wide range of language revitalisation and documentation activities including a language nest, public language classes and on-country training camps. The language nest reaches around 300 children every week, both Indigenous and Non-Indigenous.
A significant part of MDWg's revitalisation efforts is the publication of books in Miriwoong.
Some linguistic features.
Phonology.
Vowels.
The vowel system of Miriwoong comprises the following four vowel phonemes. Length is not phonemic.
Consonants.
Miriwoong distinguishes 19 consonant phonemes. The consonant inventory of Miriwoong is fairly typical for Indigenous Australian languages, having multiple lateral and nasal consonants, no voicing contrast, and no fricatives.
 may be heard as either or .
Orthography.
The largely phonemic orthography of Miriwoong was developed at the Mirima Dawang Woorlab-gerring. Some sounds that do not have a standard character in the Latin script are represented by digraphs. The vowel /u/ is spelled oo in Miriwoong.
MDWg is working with local organisations to conform to the standardised orthography when Miriwoong is written in documents or signage.

Grammar.
Some notable features of Miriwoong grammar are as follows:
Nouns.
Gender.
Miriwoong nouns have grammatical gender and adjectives and demonstratives agree with the noun. There are two genders, designated masculine and feminine.
Case.
Nouns are not marked for case in Miriwoong, although arguments are cross-referenced on the verb, in most cases using a nominative-accusative pattern.
Verbs.
Verbs in Miriwoong have a compound system of coverbs, which are generally uninflected and carry the main semantic content, and inflecting verbs, which carry the grammatical information. Both coverbs and verbs can stand alone but most verbal expressions comprise both a coverb and an inflecting verb (Newry 2015: 20-21). The inflecting verbs are a closed class and number around 20 while the coverbs are an open class. This type of verb system has been observed in other Australian languages, particularly in languages spoken in the north of Australia.

Order of succession

An order, line or right of succession is the line of individuals necessitated to hold a high office when it becomes vacated, such as head of state or an honour such as a title of nobility. This sequence may be regulated through descent or by statute.
Hereditary government form differs from elected government. An established order of succession is the normal way of passing on hereditary positions, and also provides immediate continuity after an unexpected vacancy in cases where office-holders are chosen by election: the office does not have to remain vacant until a successor is elected. In some cases the successor takes up the full role of the previous office-holder, as in the case of the presidency of many countries; in other non-hereditary cases there is not a full succession, but a caretaker chosen by succession criteria assumes some or all of the responsibilities, but not the formal office, of the position. For example, when the position of President of India becomes vacant, the Vice President of India temporarily carries out the functions of the presidency until a successor is elected; in contrast, when the position of President of the Philippines is vacant, the Vice President of the Philippines outright assumes the presidency itself for the rest of the term.
Organizations without hereditary or statutory order of succession require succession planning if power struggles prompted by power vacuums are to be avoided.
Overview.
It is often the case that the inheritance of a hereditary title, office or the like, is indivisible: when the previous holder ceases to hold the title, it is inherited by a single individual. Many titles and offices are not hereditary (such as democratic state offices) and they are subject to different rules of succession.
A hereditary line of succession may be limited to heirs of the body, or may also pass to collateral lines, if there are no heirs of the body, depending on the succession rules. These concepts are in use in English inheritance law.
The rules may stipulate that eligible heirs are "heirs male" or "heirs general" – see further primogeniture (agnatic, cognatic, and also equal).
Certain types of property pass to a descendant or relative of the original holder, recipient or grantee according to a fixed order of kinship. Upon the death of the grantee, a designated inheritance such as a peerage, or a monarchy, passes automatically to that living, legitimate, non-adoptive relative of the grantee who is most senior in descent (i.e. highest in the line of succession, regardless of age); and thereafter continues to pass to subsequent successors of the grantee, according to the same rules, upon the death of each subsequent heir.
Each person who inherits according to these rules is considered an heir at law of the grantee and the inheritance may not pass to someone who is not a natural, lawful descendant or relative of the grantee.
Collateral relatives, who share some or all of the grantee's ancestry, but do not directly descend from the grantee, may inherit if there is no limitation to "heirs of the body".
There are other kinds of inheritance rules if the heritage can be divided: heirs portioners and partible inheritance.
Monarchies and nobility.
In hereditary monarchies the order of succession determines who becomes the new monarch when the incumbent sovereign dies or otherwise vacates the throne. Such orders of succession, derived from rules established by law or tradition, usually specify an order of seniority, which is applied to indicate which relative of the previous monarch, or other person, has the strongest claim to assume the throne when the vacancy occurs.
Often, the line of succession is restricted to persons of the blood royal (but see morganatic marriage), that is, to those legally recognized as born into or descended from the reigning dynasty or a previous sovereign. The persons in line to succeed to the throne are called "dynasts". Constitutions, statutes, house laws, and norms may regulate the sequence and eligibility of potential successors to the throne.
Historically, the order of succession was sometimes superseded or reinforced by the coronation of a selected heir as co-monarch during the life of the reigning monarch. Examples are Henry the Young King and the heirs of elective monarchies, such as the use of the title King of the Romans for the Habsburg emperors. In the partially elective system of tanistry, the heir or "tanist" was elected from the qualified males of the royal family. Different monarchies use different rules to determine the line of succession.
Hereditary monarchies have used a variety of methods and algorithms to derive the order of succession among possible candidates related by blood or marriage. An advantage of employing such rules is that dynasts may, from early youth, receive grooming, education, protection, resources and retainers suitable for the future dignity and responsibilities associated with the crown of a particular nation or people. Such systems may also enhance political stability by establishing clear, public expectations about the sequence of rulers, potentially reducing competition and channeling cadets into other roles or endeavors.
Some hereditary monarchies have had unique selection processes, particularly upon the accession of a new dynasty. Imperial France established male primogeniture within the descent of Napoleon I, but failing male issue the constitution allowed the emperors to choose who among their brothers or nephews would follow them upon the throne. The Kingdom of Italy was designated a secundogeniture for the second surviving son of Napoleon I Bonaparte but, failing such, provided for the emperor's stepson, Eugène de Beauharnais, to succeed, even though the latter had no blood relationship to the House of Bonaparte. Serbia's monarchy was hereditary by primogeniture for male descendants in the male line of Prince Alexander I, but upon extinction of that line, the reigning king could choose any among his male relatives of the House of Karađorđević. In Romania, on the other hand, upon extinction of the male line descended from Carol I of Romania, the constitution stipulated that the male line of his brother, Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern, would inherit the throne and, failing other male line issue of that family, a prince of a "Western European" dynasty was to be chosen by the Romanian king and parliament. By contrast, older European monarchies tended to rely upon succession criteria that only called to the throne descendants of past monarchs according to fixed rules rooted in one or another pattern of laws or traditions.
Vertical inheritance.
In hereditary succession, the heir is automatically determined by pre-defined rules and principles. It can be further subdivided into horizontal and vertical methods, the former favoring siblings, whereas vertical favors children and grandchildren of the holder.
Male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture.
In male-preference primogeniture (in the past called cognatic primogeniture) the monarch's eldest son and his descendants take precedence over his siblings and their descendants. Elder sons take precedence over younger sons, but all sons take precedence over daughters. A female member of a dynasty can succeed to the throne if and only if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. Children represent their deceased ancestors, and the senior line of descent always takes precedence over the junior line, within each gender. The right of succession belongs to the eldest son of the reigning sovereign (see heir apparent), and next to the eldest son of the eldest son.
This is the system in Spain and Monaco, and was the system used in the ancient kingdoms of Portugal, of England and Scotland and later, the Kingdom of Great Britain and finally, the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms (although, during the Middle Ages, Scotland also supported tanistry and proximity of blood, both through the male and female lines, due to the intermingling of Pictish and Gaelic succession rules).
With respect to hereditary titles, it is usually the rule everywhere in Scotland and baronies by writ in the United Kingdom, but usually these English baronies by writ go into abeyance when the last male titleholder dies leaving more than one surviving sister or more than one descendant in the legitimate female line of the original titleholder. In England, Fiefs or titles granted "in tail general" or to "heirs general" follow this system for sons, but daughters are considered equal co-heirs to each other, which can result in abeyance. In the medieval period, actual practice varied with local custom. While women could inherit manors, power was usually exercised by their husbands ("jure uxoris") or their sons ("jure matris"). However, in Scotland, Salic law or any of its variations have never been practised, and all the hereditary titles are inherited through male-preference primogeniture, where in the extinction of a male line, the eldest sister automatically receives the titles, and rules in her own right, not in the right of her son. A famous example of this is Marjorie, Countess of Carrick, mother of Robert the Bruce, who was the Countess of Carrick in her own right.
A similar system was practised in many of the kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent from the Middle Ages to the Indian independence movement. In many of these kingdoms, adoption was allowed from a relative if a monarch did not have children, and the adopted child could succeed to the throne at the death of the monarch. (Shahu I adopted Rajaram II who ruled as king and he in turn adopted Shahu II who ruled as the next king. The mother of the reigning Queen Gowri Lakshmi Bayi of Travancore, Princess Bharani Thirunal Parvathy Bayi, had been adopted under the rules of the male-preference primogeniture in the matrilineal system). Often, the wife or mother of a childless king were allowed to succeed to the throne as well and allowed to rule as queen regnants in their own right, until their death, after which the throne passed to the next closest relative. An early example of this is Queen Didda of Kashmir, who ascended the throne of Kashmir in 980 CE after the death of her grandson and ruled until 1003 CE. Another example is Qudsia Begum who became the Nawab of Bhopal in 1819 CE after the death of her husband and ruled until 1837 CE. Other famous queens include Rudrama Devi, Keladi Chennamma, Ahilyabai Holkar, Velu Nachiyar and Gowri Lakshmi Bayi. Razia Sultana was a rare example of a queen who succeeded her father even when her brothers were alive. She was the reigning queen of the Delhi Sultanate from 1236 to 1240 CE.
Absolute cognatic primogeniture.
Absolute primogeniture is a law in which the eldest child of the sovereign succeeds to the throne, regardless of gender, and females (and their descendants) enjoy the same right of succession as males. This is currently the system in Sweden (since 1980), the Netherlands (since 1983), Norway (since 1990), Belgium (since 1991), Denmark (since 2009), Luxembourg (since 2011), and in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms (since 2013).
Agnatic succession (Salic law).
The Salic law, or agnatic succession, restricted the pool of potential heirs to males of the patrilineage, and altogether excluded females of the dynasty and their descendants from the succession, unless there were no living males to inherit. The Salic law applied to the former royal or imperial houses of Albania, France, Italy, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Prussia/German Empire. It currently applies to the house of Liechtenstein, and the Chrysanthemum Throne of Japan.
In 1830 in Spain the question whether or not the Salic law applied – and therefore, whether Ferdinand VII should be followed by his daughter Isabella or by his brother Charles – led to a series of civil wars and the formation of a pretender rival dynasty which still exists.
Generally, hereditary monarchies that operate under the Salic law also use primogeniture among male descendants in the male line to determine the rightful successor, although in earlier history agnatic seniority was more usual than primogeniture. Fiefs and titles granted "in tail male" or to "heirs male" follow this primogenitural form of succession. (Those granted to "heirs male of the body" are limited to the male-line descendants of the grantee; those to "heirs male general" may be inherited, after the extinction of the grantee's male-line descendants, by the male-line descendants of his father, paternal grandfather, etc.)
Agnatic-cognatic succession.
Agnatic-cognatic (or semi-Salic) succession, prevalent in much of Europe since ancient times, is the restriction of succession to those descended from or related to a past or current monarch exclusively through the male line of descent: descendants through females were ineligible to inherit unless no males of the patrilineage remained alive.
In this form of succession, the succession is reserved first to all the male dynastic descendants of all the eligible branches by order of primogeniture, then upon total extinction of these male descendants to a female member of the dynasty. The only current monarchy that operated under semi-Salic law until recently is Luxembourg, which changed to absolute primogeniture in 2011. Former monarchies that operated under semi-Salic law included Austria (later Austria-Hungary), Bavaria, Hanover, Württemberg, Russia, Saxony, Tuscany, and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.
If a female descendant should take the throne, she will not necessarily be the senior heiress by primogeniture, but usually the nearest relative to the last male monarch of the dynasty by proximity of blood. Examples are Christian I of Denmark's succession to Schleswig-Holstein, Maria Theresa of Austria (although her right ultimately was confirmed in consequence of her victory in the War of the Austrian Succession launched over her accession), Marie-Adelaide and Charlotte of Luxembourg, Anne of Brittany, as well as Christian IX of Denmark's succession in the right of his wife, Louise of Hesse.
Matrilineal succession.
Some cultures pass honours down through the female line. A man's wealth and title are inherited by his sister's children, and his children receive their inheritance from their maternal uncles.
In Kerala, southern India, a custom known as Marumakkathayam was practiced by the Nair nobility, the Malabar Muslims and the royal families. Through this system, descent and the inheritance of property were passed from the maternal uncle to nephews or nieces. The right of the child was with the maternal uncle or the mother's family rather than the father or the father's family. Through this bloodline, surnames, titles, properties, and everything of the child are inherited from his uncle or mother. Almost all the kingdoms in Kerala practised this system, including the Kingdom of Calicut, Kingdom of Cochin, the kingdom of Kolathunadu and the Kingdom of Valluvanad, to name a few. The Arakkal kingdom followed a similar matrilineal system of descent: the eldest member of the family, whether male or female, became its head and ruler; the male rulers were called Ali Rajah and the female rulers were called as Arakkal Beevis. Usually after one king, his nephew through his sister succeeded to the throne, and his own son receives a courtesy title but has no place in the line of succession. In the absence of nephews, nieces could also succeed to the kingdom, as in the case of Queen Gowri Lakshmi Bayi who was the queen regnant from 1810 to 1813. Since Indian Independence and the passing of several acts such as the Hindu Succession Act (1956), this form of inheritance is no longer recognised by law. Regardless, the pretender to the Travancore throne is still determined by matrilinear succession.
The Akans of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, West Africa have similar matrilineal succession and as such Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II, Asantehene inherited the Golden Stool (the throne) through his mother (the Asantehemaa) Nana Afia Kobi Serwaa Ampem II.
Ultimogeniture.
Ultimogeniture is an order of succession where the subject is succeeded by the youngest son (or youngest child). This serves the circumstances where the youngest is "keeping the hearth", taking care of the parents and continuing at home, whereas elder children have had time to succeed "out in the world" and provide for themselves.
Proximity of blood.
Proximity of blood is a system wherein the person closest in degree of kinship to the sovereign succeeds, preferring males over females and elder over younger siblings. This is sometimes used as a gloss for "pragmatic" successions in Europe; it had somewhat more standing during the Middle Ages everywhere in Europe. In Outremer it was often used to choose regents, and it figured in some of the succession disputes over the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It was also recognized in that kingdom for the succession of fiefs, under special circumstances: if a fief was lost to the Saracens and subsequently re-conquered, it was to be assigned to the heir in proximity of blood of the last fief-holder.
In Scotland, Robert de Brus tried to claim the Scottish crown by order of proximity. He was not successful, but his grandson later successfully claimed the crown as Robert I of Scotland.
Porphyrogeniture.
Porphyrogeniture is a system of political succession that favours the rights of sons born after their father has become king or emperor, over older siblings born before their father's ascent to the throne.
Examples of this practice include Byzantium and the Nupe Kingdom. In late 11th century England and Normandy, the theory of porphyrogeniture was used by Henry I of England to justify why he, and not his older brother Robert Curthose, should inherit the throne after the death of their brother William Rufus.
Partible inheritance.
In some societies, a monarchy or a fief was inherited in a way that all entitled heirs had a right to a share of it. The most prominent examples of this practice are the multiple divisions of the Frankish Empire under the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties, and similarly Gavelkind in the British Isles.
Secundogeniture.
A secundogeniture was a dependent territory given to a younger son of a princely house and his descendants, creating a cadet branch. This was a special form of inheritance in which the second and younger son received more possessions and prestige than the apanage which was usual in principalities practising primogeniture. It avoided the generational division of the estate to the extent that occurred under gavelkind, and at the same time gave younger branches a stake in the stability of the house.
In the rare cases in which the beneficiary was the third son in the order of succession, the second being already the holder of a secundogeniture, the domain given as a benefit was called a tertiogeniture.
Horizontal inheritance.
Seniority.
In seniority successions, a monarch's or fiefholder's next sibling (almost always "brother)", succeeds; not his children. And, if the royal house is more extensive, (male) cousins and so forth succeed, in order of seniority, which may depend upon actual age or upon the seniority between their fathers.
Rota system.
The rota system, from the Old Church Slavic word for "ladder" or "staircase", was a system of collateral succession practised (though imperfectly) in Kievan Rus' and later Appanage and early Muscovite Russia.
In this system, the throne passed not linearly from father to son, but laterally from brother to brother and then to the eldest son of the eldest brother who had held the throne. The system was begun by Yaroslav the Wise, who assigned each of his sons a principality based on seniority. When the Grand Prince died, the next most senior prince moved to Kiev and all others moved to the principality next up the ladder.
Tanistry.
The Tanistry is a Gaelic system for passing on titles and lands. In this system the Tanist (; ; ) is the office of heir-apparent, or second-in-command, among the (royal) Gaelic patrilineal dynasties of Ireland, Scotland and Mann, to succeed to the chieftainship or to the kingship.
Historically the tanist was chosen from among the heads of the "roydammna" or "righdamhna" (literally, those of "kingly material") or, alternatively, among all males of the "sept", and elected by them in full assembly. The eligibility was based on descent from a king to a few degrees of proximity. Usually descent from the male lines of a king was the norm, however in Scotland, descent through the female lines of a king was also accepted, possibly because of an intermingling with the Pictish succession rules. An example of this is King Eochaid who claimed the Scottish throne as the son of the daughter of Kenneth I.
The composition and the governance of the clan were built upon descent from a similar ancestor. The office was noted from the beginning of recorded history in Ireland, and probably pre-dates it. A story about Cormac mac Airt refers to his eldest son as his tanist. Following his murder by a member of the Deisi, another "roydammna", Eochaid Gonnat, succeeded as king.
The royal succession in Celtic Scotland was limited to the elective succession of the male descendants of "Siol Alpein" (House of Alpin) until the accession of King Malcolm II in 1005, who introduced the concept of hereditary monarchy in Scotland. He did so to try to eliminate the strife caused by the elective law, which encouraged rival claimants to fight for the throne. The earlier Pictish kingdoms had allowed female-line succession to the throne and in middle age Scotland, Pictish and Gaelic succession rules were intermingled. Since Malcolm had only daughters, the throne passed to his grandson through his eldest daughter and later, their descendants. The Irish monarchies, for their part, never at any stage allowed for female line succession.
Elective succession.
Appointment, election, tanistry, and rotation.
Order of succession can be arranged by appointment: either the incumbent monarch or some electoral body appoints an heir or a list of heirs before vacancy occurs. A monarchy may be generally elective, although in a way that the next holder will be elected only after it becomes vacant.
In history, quite often, but not always, appointments and elections favored, or were limited to, members of a certain dynasty or extended family. There may be genealogical rules to determine all who are entitled to succeed, and who will be favored. This has led sometimes to an order of succession that balances branches of a dynasty by rotation.
It currently applies, with variations, to Andorra, Cambodia, Eswatini, the Holy See, Kuwait, Malaysia, the UAE, and Samoa. It is also used in Ife, Oyo and the other 
subnational states of the Yorubaland region.
Lateral succession.
Lateral or fraternal system of succession mandates principles of seniority among members of a dynasty or dynastic clan, with a purpose of election a best qualified candidate for the leadership. The leaders are elected as being the most mature elders of the clan, already in possession of military power and competence. Fraternal succession is preferred to ensure that mature leaders are in charge, removing a need for regents. The lateral system of succession may or may not exclude male descendants in the female line from succession. In practice, when no male heir is mature enough, a female heir is usually determined "pragmatically", by proximity to the last monarch, like Boariks of the Caucasian Huns or Tamiris of Massagetes in Middle Asia were selected. The lateral monarch is generally elected after the leadership throne becomes vacant. In the early years of the Mongol empire, the death of the ruling monarchs, Genghis Khan and Ögedei Khan, immediately stopped the Mongols' western campaigns because of the upcoming elections.
In East Asia, the lateral succession system is first recorded in the pre-historical period starting with the late Shang dynasty's Wai Bing succeeding his brother Da Ding, and then in connection with a conquest by the Zhou of the Shang, when Wu Ding was succeeded by his brother Zu Geng in 1189 BC and then by another brother Zu Jia in 1178 BC.
A drawback of the lateral succession is that, while ensuring a most competent leadership for the moment, the system inherently created derelict princely lines not eligible for succession. Any scion of an eligible heir who did not live long enough to ascend to the throne was cast aside as not eligible, creating a pool of discontented pretenders called "Tegin" in Turkic and "Izgoi" in Rus dynastic lines. The unsettled pool of derelict princes would eventually bring havoc to the succession order and dismemberment to the state.
Succession crises.
When a monarch dies without a clear successor, a succession crisis often ensues, frequently resulting in a war of succession. For example, when King Charles IV of France died, the Hundred Years War erupted between Charles' cousin, Philip VI of France, and Charles' nephew, Edward III of England, to determine who would succeed Charles as the King of France. When the crown of Scotland became vacant in September 1290 on the death of the seven-year-old Queen Margaret, 13 claimants to the throne came forward. Where the line of succession is clear, it has sometimes happened that a pretender with a weak or spurious claim but military or political power usurps the throne.
In recent years researchers have found significant connections between the types of rules governing succession in monarchies and autocracies and the frequency with which coups or succession crises occur.
Religion.
In Tibetan Buddhism, it is believed that the holders of some high offices such as the Dalai Lama are reincarnations of the incumbent: the order of succession is simply that an incumbent is followed by a reincarnation of himself. When an incumbent dies, his successor is sought in the general population by certain criteria considered to indicate that the reincarnated Dalai Lama has been found, a process which typically takes two to four years to find the infant boy.
In the Catholic Church, there are prescribed procedures to be followed in the case of vacancy of the papacy or a bishopric.
Republics.
In republics, the requirement to ensure continuity of government at all times has resulted in most offices having some formalized order of succession. In a country with fixed-term elections, the head of state (president) is often succeeded following death, resignation, or impeachment by the vice president, parliament speaker, chancellor, or prime minister, in turn followed by various office holders of the legislative assembly or other government ministers. In many republics, a new election takes place some time after the "presidency" becomes unexpectedly vacant.
In states or provinces within a country, frequently a lieutenant governor or deputy governor is elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the governor.

Théophile Marion Dumersan

Théophile Marion Dumersan (4 January 1780, Plou, Cher – 13 April 1849, Paris) was a French writer of plays, vaudevilles, poetry, novels, chanson collections, librettos, and novels, as well as a numismatist and curator attached to the Cabinet des médailles et antiques of the Bibliothèque royale.
Life.
The family's real surname was Marion but – to distinguish himself from his brothers – Théophile's brother altered his surname to "du Mersan", after the name of one of its lands. The young Théophile had already found a taste for the theatre by 1795 by learning to read Racine and Molière. In that year, aged 16, whilst his family was distressed by the Reign of Terror, Théophile found work under Aubin-Louis Millin de Grandmaison, curator of the Cabinet des médailles et antiques de la Bibliothèque royale. With his colleague Théodore-Edme Mionnet, future member of the , he perfected a new system for classifying medals into geographical and chronological order, and protected the collection from dispersal by the allies after Napoleon's defeat. He then published at his own expense a history of the collection and description, as newly rearranged according to historical principles, in 1838 All this led to his being named curator of the Cabinet in 1842.
At the age of 18, he put on his first play, titled "Arlequin perruquier, ou Les Têtes à la Titus", a critique of the fashions and mores of the day, and soon began supplying the "théâtres de boulevard". In two years, he wrote no less than 18 plays, including "L'Ange et le diable" in 1799 (a 5-act drama which was produced more than 5 times, a remarkable number for that era). In total, he produced 238 pieces, more than 50 of which he wrote without a collaborator. The others were the result of a collaboration with better Parisian vaudevillistes, including Jean-Nicolas Bouilly, Nicolas Brazier, Pierre-Frédéric-Adolphe Carmouche, Marc-Antoine Désaugiers, Mélesville and Eugène Scribe. His greatest success was "Les Saltimbanques", written with Charles Varin, a "farce désopilante" according to the "Grand Dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle", put on at the Théâtre des Variétés in 1838.
Amidst all these productions, Dumersan also found time to write works on numismatics and the history of the theatre, including the "Manuel des coulisses", a lexicon of theatrical expressions and actors' slang. Towards the end of his life, he published several collections of chansons, notably the "Chansons nationales et populaires de France", published in two volumes in 1866.

Stanley Mouse

Stanley George Miller (born October 10, 1940), better known as Mouse or Stanley Mouse, is an American artist who is notable for his 1960s psychedelic rock concert poster designs and album covers for the Grateful Dead, Journey, and other bands.
Early life and education.
Mouse was born in Fresno, California on October 10, 1940, He grew up in Detroit, where he was given the nickname "Mouse" in grade school. In 1956, he was expelled from Mackenzie High School for mischievously repainting the façade at The Box, a restaurant across the street from the school. He spent his junior year at nearby Cooley High School, and completed his education at Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts, which is now the College for Creative Studies.
Career.
By 1958, Mouse was fascinated with the weirdo hot rod art movement that was founded a decade earlier in California. Having developed skills using an airbrush, he began painting T-shirts at custom car shows, where he met and then worked with Ed Roth, the leading exponent of Weirdo Hot Rod art.
In 1959, Mouse and his family founded Mouse Studios, a mail-order company, which sold his products. 
In 1964, he was invited to help in the design of Monogram automobile model kits using the "monster" cartoon characters he had developed to compete with Roth's "Rat Fink" character.
In 1965, Mouse travelled to San Francisco with a group of art school friends. Settling initially in Oakland, Mouse met Alton Kelley, a self-taught artist who recently arrived from Virginia City, Nevada, where he joined a group of hippies who called themselves the Red Dog Saloon gang. Upon arrival in San Francisco, Kelley and other veterans of the gang renamed themselves The Family Dog, and began producing rock music dances. 
In 1966 and 1967, Mouse and Alton Kelley lived and worked from 715 Ashbury across the street from 710 Ashbury, where members of The Grateful Dead resided. 
In 1966, when Chet Helms assumed leadership of the group and began promoting the dances at the Avalon Ballroom, Mouse and Kelley began working together to produce posters for the events. The pair also later produced posters for promoter Bill Graham and for other events in the psychedelic community. From September 1967 to December 1967, Mouse and Kelley created psychedelic posters for shows at Helms’ The Family Dog Denver.
In 1967, Mouse collaborated with artists Kelley, Rick Griffin, Victor Moscoso and Wes Wilson to create the Berkeley Bonaparte Distribution Agency. 
Mouse and Kelley also worked together as lead artists at Kelley Mouse studios producing album cover art for the bands Journey and Grateful Dead. The Monster Company founded in 1971 also developed a profitable line of T-shirts, utilizing the four color process for silk screening.
The psychedelic posters Mouse and Kelley produced were heavily influenced by Art Nouveau graphics, particularly the works of Alphonse Mucha and Edmund Joseph Sullivan. Material associated with psychedelics, such as Zig-Zag rolling papers, were also referenced. Producing posters advertising for such musical groups as Big Brother and the Holding Company, Quicksilver Messenger Service, and Grateful Dead led to meeting the musicians and making contacts that were later to prove fruitful.
In 1969 Stanley was commissioned to paint Eric Clapton's car in London. After brief periods in London and Massachusetts, he moved to Toronto where he ran a Yorkville waterbed store called The Waterbed Gallery, whose walls featured his artwork. 
In 1971, Mouse returned to California, living near Kelley in Marin County, and the pair resumed their partnership, producing commercial artwork related to the Grateful Dead and later Journey. The pair are credited with creating the skeleton and roses image that became the Grateful Dead's archetypal iconography, and Journey's wings and beetles that appeared on their album covers from 1977 to 1980. 
In 1977, Mouse, with Kelley, created the Styx album cover for "The Grand Illusion", featuring a pastiche of René Magritte. Mouse and Kelley continued to work together on rock memorabilia until 1980.
In the early 1980s, Mouse moved to New Mexico, where he began producing fine art in a variety of media. In 1999, he contributed a portrait of Skip Spence to the tribute album, "", being a collection of cover versions of songs by the co-founder of Moby Grape performed by such artists as Beck, Tom Waits and Robert Plant.
In 2002, Mouse filed a lawsuit against the producers of the film "Monsters, Inc.", alleging that the characters of Mike and Sulley were based on his drawings of "Excuse My Dust", which he unsuccessfully pitched to Hollywood producers in 1998. A Disney spokeswoman responded that the characters in Monsters, Inc were "developed independently by the Pixar and Walt Disney Pictures creative teams, and do not infringe on anyone's copyrights".

Mongolian gazelle

The Mongolian gazelle ("Procapra gutturosa"), or dzeren (), is a medium-sized antelope native to the semiarid Central Asian steppes of Mongolia, southern Siberia and northern China. The name "dzeren" is the Russian spelling and pronunciation of the Buryat "zeeren" (Buryat: зээрэн; akin to the Mongolian word "zeer" ()).
Taxonomy.
While the dzeren and its two sister-species (the Tibetan gazelle or "goa" and the rare Przewalski's gazelle of Qinghai, China) are commonly referred to as “gazelles”, they are not technically “true” gazelles, as they are not placed within the "Gazella" genus. Rather, these three procaprid antelope species are placed together in their own genus, "Procapra", falling under the tribe of Antilopini (of the subfamily Antilopinae), under the greater Bovidae family of the Artiodactyla Order. In general, the dzeren are fluffier-coated than true gazelles, possessing an almost “teddy bear”-like appearance, as opposed to the sleek and smooth, deer-like qualities of "Gazella" and other species. The dzeren's face is somewhat more comparable to a Chinese water deer than a true gazelle.
Description.
In the summer, the dzeren has coat of tawny light brown with pale pinkish tones, which grows thicker, longer and paler during the winter. It also has a distinctive, heart-shaped white patch on its rump area, divided by a median line of darker color. The male has lyre-shaped horns which curl backwards from the forehead. It is an extremely capable long-distance runner and a good swimmer.
Distribution and habitat.
Mongolian gazelles live in semi-arid, cold, and temperate ecosystems. They thrive in flat or undulating steppes and dry grasslands, with a preference for steppe and desert steppe habitats adorned with clusters of vegetation. The estimated global range of the Mongolian gazelle is 746,281 km2, of which 91% is in Mongolia (681,863 km2), 5% in China (34,718 km2) and 4% in Russia (29,700 km2). 
Behavior.
In the winter, they are mostly diurnal, but in the summer, they are active shortly after sunrise and before sunset. They tend to travel a lot, and migrations takes place in spring and autumn, but the distance and direction vary depending on the weather and food availability.
The groups usually consists of 20-30 individuals in the summer, and 100 in the winter. However, herds up to 5,000 individuals are not unusual. They still exist in large numbers, with a small captive population; the population trend is unknown. In 2007, a mega-herd of a quarter of a million Mongolian gazelles was seen gathering on the country's steppes, one of the world's last great wildernesses.
Reproduction.
The mating season is in the late autumn or winter; at this time, the males' throats swell in a goiter-like effect. Competition is vigorous, but fights rarely break out. The gestation period lasts for about 5–6 months. Births occur is June and July, when groups of dozens of females separate from the herd to give birth, rejoining the herd afterward. They usually give birth to a single young and occasionally twins. They weigh about 3 kg and can keep up with their mother after a few days. They will be able to mate after 17–18 months.
Relationship with humans.
The Mongolian gazelle is still one of the most numerous large animals in the world, with the total population around 1.5 million individuals, but roughly 100,000 are killed each year. However, the conservation status is at least concern. Whether the population is increasing or decreasing is unknown, but the population is known to be subject to significant fluctuations due to diseases and severe winters. They have been hunted for millennia—a passage in the 13th-century "Secret History of the Mongols" tells how a young Shigi Qutuqu managed to round up a herd of gazelles in a winter blizzard.

Universal Primary Education

The second of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals focuses on achieving Universal Primary Education. This goal aims to ensure global access to complete primary education for all children, regardless of gender, by 2015. Education plays a crucial role in achieving all Millennium Development Goals, as it equips future generations with the necessary tools to combat poverty and prevent diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS.
Despite recognizing the importance of educational investment, a joint report by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and UNICEF titled "Fixing the Broken Promise of Education for All: Findings from the Global Initiative on Out-of-School Children" revealed that the 2015 target for universal primary education was not met. The report indicated that as of 2015, approximately 58 million children of primary school age worldwide were not receiving formal education.
Achieving universal primary education.
Since 1999, there has been great progress towards achieving universal primary enrollment due in large part to a pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Education for All (EFA). The number of primary school-age children who are out of school has dropped by 42% between 2000 and 2012, despite rapid population growth.
Greater than half of countries and regions worldwide have a net enrolment rate of more than 95% and either already have or are close to achieving universal primary education. However, despite an increase in enrollment over the past decade, global progress has stalled since 2007, and net enrolment or attendance is less than 80 percent in about 20 countries. Of the 58 million children out of school:
Roughly half of all out-of-school children come from just a few countries, many of them characterized by conflict, instability, and extreme poverty. West and Central Africa is home to one-third of all primary school-age out-of-school children, making it the region with the lowest rates of school participation. Challenges to achieving universal primary education are exacerbated in unstable regions, as they have greater difficulty in accessing financial support.
The barriers which prevent children around the world from obtaining primary-level education are diverse and require tailored responses. Children living in conflict-affected areas account for "Just 20% of the world's children of primary school age but 50% of the world's out-of-school children." Additionally, inequalities in wealth significantly impact out-of-school rates. In many countries, children from the poorest 20 per cent of the population are less likely to attend school than those who are better off. Despite overall improvements, girls continue to be at a disadvantage as 53%—more than half—of the estimated 58 million primary age out-of-school-children, are girls. A research paper published in December 2019 found that in 2017, 1 in 6 women aged 20–24 had not completed primary school.
Factors contributing to lack of access and poor attendance.
Location (climate).
Location contributes to childrens' lack of access to primary education. In certain areas of the world, it is more difficult for children to get to school. For example, in high-altitude areas of India, poor weather conditions for more than 7 months of the year make school attendance erratic and force children to remain at home.
In these remote areas, lack of funds contributes to low attendance rates by creating undesirable and unsafe learning environments. In 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that poor weather conditions existed in many rural areas; one out of every two rural schools had at least one inadequate structural or mechanical feature. In these situations where regular school attendance is rare, a low population contributes to the problem. In other locations, large numbers are often the cause of low attendance rates.
Due to population growth, many urban schools have expanded their boundaries making school transportation more complicated. "For over 50 years, the U.S. has been shifting away from small neighborhood schools to larger schools in lower density areas. Rates of children walking and biking to school have become low significantly over this period". There is evidence to prove that the distance to and from school contributes to a child's attendance or lack of attendance. In a study done while investigating the relationship between location (distance) and school attendance in Mali, about half of the villages reported that the school was too far away for students to enroll.
There is still a supposition as to whether primary schools are more accessible in rural areas or urban areas because situations differ depending on geographic location. In a study examining the correlation between location and school attendance in Argentina and Panama, researchers found that urban residence was positively correlated with school attendance, but another study in a Louisiana school district found that schools with the lowest attendance rates were in metropolitan areas.
Gender.
Gender contributes to a child's lack of access and attendance to education. Although it may not be an obvious problem today. Gender equality in education has been an issue for a long time. Many investments in girls' education in the twentieth century addressed the widespread lack of access to primary education in developing countries.
Boys not in education outnumber girls in the majority of regions. In 2014, girls outnumber boys in regions with the worst attendance, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, resulting in the total number of girls out of education being approximately 11% higher than the number of boys out of education world-wide.
In 25 countries, the proportion of boys enrolling in secondary school is higher than girls by 10% or more and in five countries (India, Nepal, Togo, Turkey and Yemen), the gap exceeds 20%. Enrollment is low for both boys and girls in sub-Saharan Africa, with rates of just 27% and 22% respectively. It is generally believed that girls are often discouraged from attending primary schooling (especially in less developed countries) for religious and cultural reasons, but there is little evidence available to support this assumption. However, there is evidence to prove that the disparity of gender in education is real. Today, some 78% of girls drop out of school compared with 48% of boys.
Cost.
Cost is a significant factor affecting access to and attendance in primary education, particularly in developing countries. It encompasses various expenses such as tuition, room and board, and other fees associated with schooling.
Opportunity costs.
High opportunity costs often influence the decision of children to attend school. For example, UNICEF estimates that 121 million children of primary school age are kept out of school to work in fields or at home. For many families in developing countries, the economic benefits of not attending primary school can outweigh the perceived benefits of education.
Direct costs.
Besides opportunity costs, school fees can be prohibitively expensive, especially for poor households. In rural China, for instance, families may dedicate as much as a third of their income to school fees.
The relationship between school fees and attendance is complex. While official statistics in China report a low dropout rate, some experts question these figures, noting that dropout rates in rural areas appear to be much higher.
Other factors.
Unemployment among parents can also contribute to children's inability to attend school. When jobs are scarce and parents struggle to meet basic needs like food, education often becomes a lower priority.
The cost of education can vary significantly depending on whether a school is public or private. Public schools are generally less expensive because their needs are mostly covered by government funding, unlike private schools which rely on tuition from families.
Even when schooling is relatively inexpensive, some families still struggle to afford associated costs such as:
While the exact relationship between cost and attendance rates is not fully understood, there is substantial evidence that cost is a significant factor affecting children's access to and attendance in primary education.
Language.
In developing countries throughout the world, the educational context is characterized not by monolingual settings but rather multilingual settings. Often, children are asked to enroll in a primary school where the Medium of Instruction (MI) is not their home language but rather the language of the government or another dominant society.
Children who are taught their mother tongue at an early age tend to have the ability to communicate with outsiders who understand it too. Most times, the mother tongue is known generally by people who live together and are from the same state. The language introduced to a child at a tender age makes it easier for the child to learn faster if taught in that language. Learning another language of a dominant society as a child can make it difficult for the child to understand, thereby causing lack of attendance in school.
Studies throughout the world demonstrate the importance of the Medium of Instruction in determining a child's educational attainment. According to Mehrotra (1988):
Education and global health.
Education is a crucial factor in ending global poverty. With education, employment opportunities are broadened, income levels are increased and child health is improved.
In areas where access, attendance and quality of education have seen improvements, there has been an increase in the healthiness of the community in general. In fact, children of educated mothers are 50% more likely to live past the age of five. Not only does education improve individual and family health but it also improves the health of the community. In countries with solid education system in place, there are lower crime rates, greater economic growth and improved social services.
School feeding programs.
The World Bank defines school feeding programs as a targeted social safety net that provides educational and health benefits to vulnerable children, aims to increase attendance rates, decreases absenteeism, and improves nutrition at the household level.
One successful method to ensuring that children attend school on a regular basis is through school feeding programs. Many different organizations fund school feeding programs, among them the World Food Programme and the World Bank. The idea of a school feeding program is that children are provided with meals at school with the expectation that they will attend school regularly. School feeding programs have succeeded because the food that children receive at school can be a critical source of nutrition. School meals have helped to improve concentration and performance of children in school. 
Another aspect of school feeding programs is take home rations. When, for economic reasons, there is a need to care for the elderly or a family member suffering from HIV, or cultural beliefs keep a parent from sending their child (especially a female child) to school, these take home rations provide incentives to send children to school rather than to work.
Current efforts.
Global Campaign for Education.
This organization promotes education as a basic human right. It motivates people and groups to put public pressure on governments and the international community in order to assure that all children are provided with free compulsory public education. It brings together major NGOs and Teachers Unions in over 120 countries to work in solidarity towards their vision of universal primary education.
Right to Education Project.
The Right to Education Project aims to promote social mobilization and legal accountability, looking to focus on the legal challenges to the right to education.
To ensure continued relevance and engagement with activists and the academic community, the Project also undertakes comparative research to advance an understanding of the right to education.
UNICEF.
In working with local, national and international partners, UNICEF's work supports the attainment of universal primary education.
Oxfam International.
This organization is a confederation of 12 organizations that are dedicated to reducing poverty and eliminating injustices in the world. Oxfam works on a grassroots level in countries around the world to ensure that all people have access to basic human rights, including the right to education.
Save the Children.
This organization advocates education as a way for individuals to escape poverty. They are running a campaign entitled "Rewrite the Future" to encourage American citizens in position of power and wealth to take action against the injustices in education system around the world. Save the Children also operates educational programs in 30 countries all over the world.
Peace Corps.
This United States government organization has volunteers on the ground in 75 countries. Many of the volunteers are working as teachers in rural areas or working to promote and improve access to education in the areas in which they are stationed.
United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization.
UNESCO works to improve education through projects, advice, capacity-building and networking. UNESCO's Education for All Campaign by 2015 is the driving force in UNESCO's work in the field of education at the moment.
World Bank.
This organization provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries. Loans and grants from the World Bank provide much of the funding for educational projects around the world including but not limited to school feeding programs.
Child Aid.
Child Aid conducts school and library based reading programs in over 50 indigenous villages in Guatemala, where literacy rates are lower than anywhere in Latin America. Through its literacy development programing, it helps teachers and librarians create and improve community libraries and deliver 10,000 children's books annually.
World Food Program.
This organization provides food relief in areas that need it most and is one of the major funders of school feeding programs.
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
This organization runs a campaign titled '"Education for Rural People" in which they work to ensure education for rural people as the key to reduce poverty, encourage food security and promote sustainable development.
Global Partnership for Education.
The Global Partnership for Education was launched in 2002 as the Fast Track Initiative. It was designed as a major initiative to help countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of Universal Primary Education (UPE) by 2015. It was endorsed by the Development Committee of the World Bank as a process that would provide quick and incremental technical and financial support to countries that have policies but are not on track to attain Universal Primary Education by 2015.
In 2011, the organization re-committed to achieve education for all children through their transformation into the Global Partnership for Education.

Shaun Higgins

Shaun Higgins (born 4 March 1988) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played in the Australian Football League (AFL). Higgins played for the Western Bulldogs from 2006 to 2014, the North Melbourne Football Club from 2015 to 2020 and the Geelong Football Club from 2021 to 2022. Higgins is a dual Syd Barker Medallist and was selected in the 2018 All-Australian team. He received a nomination for the 2007 AFL Rising Star award in round 8 of the 2007 season.
Early life.
Higgins was raised in Geelong, Victoria and attended St Joseph's College. He played junior football for Newtown &amp; Chilwell Football Club and was a supporter. His father Mick played reserves football for Geelong. His sister Danielle played netball for the Geelong Cougars in the Victorian Netball League and played football for in the AFL Women's (AFLW).
Higgins was the Geelong Falcons' best onballer and was projected to be a top-ten selection in the 2005 AFL draft, but fell to pick 11, the 's first selection.
AFL career.
Western Bulldogs (2006–2014).
He managed to make his debut in his first season, against Collingwood. He played mostly as a small forward then but suffered a season-ending elbow injury in round 13 against the West Coast Eagles, ruling him out of that year's finals campaign. Before his injury he showed flashes of brilliance in front of goals. But his fitness levels were not quite up. But even at that stage he was a standout with his accurate kicking and awareness of what was around him.
With the frustration of missing his first season, This was Higgins' breakout year after coming off a season ending elbow injury. He proved a handy Goal Kicker up forward that could take a good mark and set up players for a Goal. This was the year where the doubters got off his back and found out just how good he really was, and proved what kind of prospect he is. The game most notable was against the team he made his debut against, Collingwood where he kicked the Winning Goal. He was the Round 8 nominee for the 2007 NAB Rising Star award.
With a great win against Adelaide to open the season Higgins played a vital role in the win. His Season was cut short in round 2 with a Broken Ankle against Melbourne when he landed on it coming down from a Marking contest. It was only supposed to keep him our for a few weeks but the injury was worse than first thought. But came back to play in the Finals. Higgins learned a valuable lesson that year and it has made him a better Footballer. When he was injured he was always in the Bulldogs rooms encouraging his team mates and this was the first sign of Leadership that he shown and he later was voted by his peers as a leader. In the preliminary Final against , Higgins was playing on Darren Milburn, Higgins went on to kick two goals on him and set one up and Milburn got taken off the ground.
Although he is primarily a forward, Higgins has been used sometimes in the midfield. In 2009 Higgins was promoted into the Leadership group. And he received the famous number 7 that was worn by Scott West and Doug Hawkins before him. Higgins had a brilliant pre-season that was up there with Daniel Cross and Matthew Boyd in the time trials. He is touted as being a potential captain of the Club. He had a solid 2009 season but had hamstring troubles that put a damper on his performance. He has the ability of kicking both feet and has great speed. His most notable goal was against Geelong. He is a very fit onballer that can run all day. He signed a contract extension midway through the season.
North Melbourne (2015–2020).
On 3 October 2014, Higgins signed with the North Melbourne Football Club as a restricted free agent after the Western Bulldogs decided not to match the Kangaroos' offer. Higgins had a stellar first season with North Melbourne, playing 24 games and kicking 39 goals. Higgins was also one of their most consistent players all year playing as a high half forward. The 2016 season however, was not one to remember for Higgins as he injured himself in round 7, thus ruling him out for three months. Higgins returned in round 23 and played in the losing elimination final.
Higgins played every match for the 2017 season apart from the round five match against to go on and win his first best and fairest, the Syd Barker Medal. At the end of the 2019 season, Higgins signed a one-year contract extension, turning his back on interest from Geelong.
In 2020 he was named in the St Joseph’s College team of champions, recognising the best VFL/AFL players to have attended the school.
Geelong (2021–2022).
At the conclusion of the 2020 season, Higgins was asked to look elsewhere by North Melbourne to secure his future and accepted a two-year deal at Geelong; he was traded for pick 30 in that year's draft.

Wieboldt's

Wieboldt Stores, Inc., also known as Wieboldt's, did business as a Chicago general retailer between 1883 and 1987. It was founded in 1883 by storekeeper William A. Wieboldt. The flagship location was at One North State Street Store in Chicago. 
History.
Wieboldt's operated its flagship store at State Street and Madison Street in Downtown Chicago. In 1961, Wieboldt's acquired the failed "Mandel Brothers" store on State Street as well as a smaller branch store in Lincoln Village shopping center. By the 1970s Wieboldt's operated more than 15 stores in the Chicago metropolitan area.
Wieboldt's celebrated 100 years in business in April 1983. An advertisement in the "Chicago Sun-Times" stated "Building for a New Tomorrow". "An important part of Chicago's past, we look to the future with confidence and enthusiasm. The dream of yesterday is the promise of tomorrow. Chicago, Wieboldt's. Tomorrow begins today."
During the 1980s, the chain had trouble staying profitable, eventually leading the company into bankruptcy in 1987. The chain never recovered and all the stores closed.
Stores.
Stores closed on March 10, 1987:
Four stores remained open longer:

Promotions.
Wieboldt's was known for giving S&amp;H Green Stamps with purchases, and there were redemption centers located in their stores. The State Street location included a particularly large redemption center. Customers would choose items based on the number of stamps redeemed. In the 1940s and 1950s, and then again in the mid-1980s, they sponsored a broadcast program featuring "The Cinnamon Bear": stories of how Cinnamon Bear takes his young friends on a trip to "maybe land" in search of the Silver Star. A stuffed teddy bear version could be purchased from the stores for $2.98 in the 1950s, and Santa would give out free Cinnamon Bear buttons to children visiting Santa. The program was first produced by Glen Heisch and Elizabeth Heisch in 1937 in Hollywood and syndicated around the country. Wieboldt's had a number of memorable radio ads on radio during Chicago Cubs games in the early 1960s, featuring announcers Jack Quinlan and Lou Boudreau. Some of them can be heard at Wieboldt's Commercials Quinlan &amp; Boudreau.

Wort und Tat

Wort und Tat (Words and Deeds) is a 10-minute-long Nazi propaganda film directed by Fritz Hippler, which was released in 1938. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum described the film as a "Propaganda film about the improved life of the German people under Hitler." The film is known for the extensive use of montage to get its message across, in a style reminiscent of Sergei Eisensteins . It was ordered by Joseph Goebbels.
The film begins with a montage of clips from the Weimar period, showing a series of clips of Labor and Communist rallies, interspersed with scenes of scantily clad cabaret girls, and then shots of posters of various Weimar era political parties. This illustrates the "chaos" and "decadence" of the Weimar period. This sequence ends with former chancellor Heinrich Brüning making a speech against National Socialism.

Phono input

Phono input is a set of input jacks, usually mini jacks or RCA connectors, located on the rear panel of a preamp, mixer or amplifier, especially on early radio sets, to which a phonograph or turntable is attached.
Modern phono cartridges give a very low level output signal of the order of a few millivolts which the circuitry amplifies and equalizes. Phonograph recordings are made with high frequencies boosted and the low frequencies attenuated: during playback the frequency response changes are reversed. This reduces background noise, including clicks or pops, and also conserves the amount of physical space needed for each groove, by reducing the size of the larger low-frequency undulations. This is accomplished in the amplifier with a phono input that incorporates standardized RIAA equalization circuitry.
Through at least the 1980s, the phono input was widely available on consumer stereo equipment—even some larger boomboxes had them. By the 2000s only very sophisticated and expensive stereo receivers retained the phono input, since most users were expected to use digital music formats such as CD or satellite radio. Some newer low-cost turntables include built-in amplifiers to produce line-level (one volt) outputs; devices are available that perform this conversion for use with computers; or older amplifiers or radio receivers can be used. Nearly all DJ mixers have two or more phono inputs, together with two or more one-volt line inputs that also use RCA connectors.
This "phono input" designed for the millivolt signal from an unamplified turntable should not be confused with the modern standard one-volt line input and output that also uses RCA connectors and is found on video cameras, recorders and similar modern equipment.

1974 (We Were Young)

"1974 (We Were Young)" is a 1988 single by Christian music singer Amy Grant. It was released as the third single from her album "Lead Me On".
Lyrics.
The song is about Grant's discovery of faith at the age of fourteen (Grant was born on November 25, 1960), the first verse saying, "We were young...Down upon our knees/we tasted holy wine." In the chorus, Grant tells of God's love at the founding of Him, saying, "Purer than the sky behind the rain...Love had lit a fire we were the flame." The final verses talk about how the discovery of God changes people: "No one had to say we were changed/Nothing else we lived through would ever be the same" and how those who experience God's love never want it to go away: "Stay with me/Make it ever new." In interviews following the release of the song, she revealed that it should have been titled "1975".
Chart success.
Unlike Grant's previous few singles, "1974" did not achieve mainstream success. Although a #1 Christian single, "1974" only managed to reach #31 on the Adult Contemporary chart.
The B side of the single is "If You Have to Go Away", another track from the album.

A cutaneous nerve is a nerve that provides nerve supply to the skin.
Human anatomy.
In human anatomy, cutaneous nerves are primarily responsible for providing cutaneous innervation, sensory innervation to the skin. In addition to sympathetic and autonomic afferent (sensory) fibers, most cutaneous nerves also contain sympathetic efferent (visceromotor) fibers, which innervate cutaneous blood vessels, sweat glands, and the arrector pilli muscles of hair follicles. These structures are important to the sympathetic nervous response.
There are many cutaneous nerves in the human body, only some of which are named.

Edward Warren Clark (January 27, 1849 – June 5, 1907) was an American educator who taught thousands of young Japanese the rudiments of modern science while employed as a teacher in Japan from 1871 to 1875. 
Biography.
Edward Warren Clark was born on January 27, 1849, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire to Rufus Wheelwright Clark and Eliza C Clark. Clark and his family moved from Portsmouth to New York when he was six. He graduated from what is now Rutgers University in New Jersey in 1869 with a degree in Chemistry and Biology. He was one of several hundred teachers hired by the Japanese government to familiarize students with the science and technology of the West. Clark first taught at a school in Shizuoka that trained students to become science teachers. He later taught at what became Tokyo University in Tokyo, where he helped to found the chemistry department, one of the first of its kind in Japan. A devout Christian, Clark sought to introduce the Bible and Christian doctrines to his students whenever possible. After returning to the United States Clark wrote a highly informative book about Japan: "Life and Adventure in Japan".
Clark, who later became an Episcopalian priest, visited Japan on two later occasions and worked hard to garner American support for Japan during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05). Clark was a close associate of William Elliot Griffis (1842–1928), widely regarded as the first major American Japanologist.

Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam

Fra' Philippe de Villiers de L'Isle-Adam (1464 – 21 August 1534) was a prominent member of the Knights Hospitaller at Rhodes and later Malta. Having risen to the position of Prior of the "Langue of Auvergne", he was elected 44th Grand Master of the Order in 1521.
He commanded the Order during Sultan Suleiman's long and bloody Siege of Rhodes in 1522, when 600 knights and 4500 soldiers resisted an invading force of about 100,000 men for six months, but eventually negotiated the capitulation and the departure of the knights on New Year's Day 1523 to Crete.
He then led the Order during several years without a permanent domicile—first Kandi on Crete, then successively Messina, Viterbo and finally Nice (1527–1529). In 1530 de L'Isle-Adam obtained the islands of Malta and Gozo and the North African port city of Tripoli as fief for the Order from Emperor Charles V and established the Order, henceforth known as the "Maltese Knights", in their new base. The Order arrived on the island on 26 October 1530 on their flagship, the "Santa Anna".
L'Isle-Adam took formal possession of the islands on 13 November, when the silver key of the capital Mdina was given to the Grand Master. Despite this, the Order settled in the coastal town of Birgu and made it their capital city. They settled in Fort Saint Angelo, which served as both a fortification and as a palace. The city was fortified and eventually Auberges for each of the Langues were built. Despite this, the Grand Master and the Order still hoped that one day they would recapture Rhodes (in fact the Order decided to make Malta their permanent home only after the Great Siege 35 years later).
L'Isle-Adam died at the Our Lady of Jesus convent ("ta' Ġieżu") in Rabat, Malta on 21 August 1534. He was buried in the Chapel of St Anne within Fort Saint Angelo, but was reburied in the crypt of Saint John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta in the late 16th century.

April Verch

April Verch (born April 7, 1978) is a Canadian fiddler, singer, and step dancer raised in the community of Rankin, Ontario, located approximately southwest from Pembroke, Ontario. The youngest daughter of Ralph and Muriel Verch, April began step dancing at age three with her first step dance teachers, Buster and Pauline Brown, and began learning fiddle at age six from Pembroke fiddler Rob Dagenais, shortly after receiving her first violin as a birthday present. Throughout her childhood, April played both old time fiddle and classical violin, having competed and having won awards at fiddle contests inside and outside Ontario, as well as regularly performing with the Deep River Symphony Orchestra over that period. She also competed and won numerous awards for her step dancing in that time frame as well.
In addition, April, with her older sister Tawnya Verch (piano, vocals and step dance), and cousins Nathan and Jonathan Pilatzke (fiddles, step dance) were in a quartet named "The Duelling Dancers", regularly competing and entertaining over this period throughout Ontario. Her local musical environment included listening to her father's country band rehearsing and performing, as well as hearing lively music at both church and community dances in the Pembroke area.
Career.
Verch attended Berklee College of Music in Boston with music instruction under fiddlers Matt Glaser and Darol Anger before embarking on her professional career. After one year of study, Verch would move back to Canada, landing in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and played as a backup fiddler for Vancouver-based Celtic pop band "Mad Pudding" and veteran Canadian country singer Tommy Hunter, as well as performing solo and teaching privately in Saskatoon, before moving home to Pembroke, Ontario. Verch began her full time touring career in 2000 and has performed internationally, including festival, theatre and performing arts centre appearances in Canada, USA, China, Australia, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, Spain, Czech Republic and the United Arab Emirates. She has also presented workshops, master classes and lectures as part of her tours and at selected music camps. April Verch's other performances have included the roles of soloist, leader of "The April Verch Band," cast performer with the fiddle group "Bowfire", and backup fiddler with various musical acts for recording sessions.
After a solo concert in 2000 was attended by Rounder Records' Ken Irwin, Verch was signed to Rounder Records. In 2001, "Verchuosity" became her debut album for the label and received a JUNO nomination for Best Roots/Traditional Solo Album. While she is best known for playing traditional Ottawa Valley style fiddle tunes, Verch's repertoire branches into many other fiddle styles. She has appeared as performer and teacher at Mark O'Connor's Fiddle Camps, and performing as a fiddler, singer, and dancer on the PBS television series, "Song of the Mountains". Since 2016, Verch has also been performing in a duo with veteran American bluegrass artist Joe Newberry. Verch received a second Juno nomination in 2020 for the album "Once a Day" in the Traditional Roots Album category.
Personal life.
Verch is married to Cody Walters, a musician who is originally from Kansas, and they live together in Horse Shoe, North Carolina.
Other releases.
In addition to her album releases, Verch has also released a book of original fiddle tunes, a Canadian fiddle method book via Mel Bay Publications, and a self produced instructional step dance DVD.

Lemon drop (candy)

A lemon drop is a sugar coated, lemon-flavored candy that is typically colored yellow and often shaped like a lemon. They can be sweet or have a more sour flavor. Lemon drops are made by boiling sugar, water and cream of tartar until it reaches the hard crack stage. As the mixture cools, lemon flavor is added. The candy is then rolled into long ropes, cut into small pieces and rolled in sugar. Lemon drops originated in England, where confectioners learned that adding acid such as lemon juice to the boiled sugar mixture prevented sugar from crystallizing.
The term "lemon drop" is also occasionally applied to lemon-flavored throat lozenges, and is the namesake of a cocktail consisting of lemon juice, vodka and sugar.
Modern lemon drops, like most hard candies we know today, descend from ancient medicinal lozenges. 18th century advances in sugar technology made hard sugar concoctions possible.

<doc id="6970755" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6970755" title="Erich Heller">
Erich Heller

Erich Heller (27 March 1911 – 5 November 1990) was a British essayist, known particularly for his critical studies in German-language philosophy and literature of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Biography.
Heller was born at Chomutov in Bohemia (then within Austria-Hungary, now the Czech Republic), to the family of a Jewish physician. He graduated a doctor of law from the German University in Prague (Deutsche Universität in Prag, Juridische Fakultät) on 11 February 1935, at the age of 23. In 1939 he emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he began his professional career as a Germanist, being active at Cambridge and London (England) and at Swansea (Wales). Heller became a British subject in 1947. From 1960 onwards he was based in the United States, primarily at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he was initially Professor of German, and subsequently Avalon Professor of the Humanities until his retirement in 1979.
For Heller, German letters as an academic discipline was something of an avocation. He kept a certain distance from the scholarly community around him, believing (with Jacob Burckhardt) this community's pedantry and unremitting quest for precision to be 'one of the most cunning enemies of truth', their cumulative effect being 'the absence of true comprehension'.
Main currents of his thought: "anima naturaliter religiosa".
Not a religious philosopher (and an agnostic by personal persuasion), he could show religious sensibility, as when he wrote, in an essay on Heinrich von Kleist that bridges Heideggerian and Biblical idioms, that:
Heller accepted the Fall, or rather its philosophical consequences. Writing elsewhere about Friedrich von Schiller Heller states that Schiller presented
"Disinherited Mind"; or the Creed of Ontological Invalidity.
Heller's "The Disinherited Mind", a seminal work published in 1952 (US ed., expanded, 1957), earned him a following among intellectuals. The project of "The Disinherited Mind" was to analyse the disappearance of Truth from the immediate environment of man, and the ensuing compulsions of Art to fill the void. Such an intervention on the part of Art, in the circumstances, results in the impoverishment of the world, not in its enrichment. It entails the loss of 'significant external reality'.
"The Disinherited Mind" was first published in Britain; two years later it was issued under the title "Enterbter Geist" by Suhrkamp in Frankfurt. An Italian translation followed in 1965, and a Japanese rendering in 1969.
Formulating the 'Creed'.
For Heller, Truth could be defined in the terms proposed by Paul Roubiczek in "Thinking in Opposites", a book that appeared in the same year as did "The Disinherited Mind": Truth must be "embodied" in external reality. (Heller says the same in "The Disinherited Mind" when he points out that the question, What is Truth? becomes irrelevant 'in the face of its embodiment'.) Roubiczek's grasp of the meaning of Truth is more philosophical than Goethe's, according to whom Truth is 'a revelation emerging at the point where the inner world of man meets external reality...'
Heller saw Truth as the first casualty of the mechanistic theory of nature, set on its course by Darwin and others, which in alliance with applied sciences roots out the intrinsic meaning of things in favour of the 'how?' of their causal interrelatedness. The thing in itself is forgotten, and with it the meaning of Reality as such. Such theories succeed merely in feeding 'the body of superstitious beliefs that had grown rampant ever since medieval scholasticism suffered its final defeat at the hands of Francis Bacon'.
This process, of Reality's being eviscerated of deeper meaning in the course of being 'explained' by modern science, constitutes the main charge that Heller laid against supporters of what he called the Creed of Ontological Invalidity. The practical result of its implementation is that nothing can exist in and of itself: things' scientific explanation deprives them of their individual "being" as entities and reduces them to the position of mere links in a much more broadly conceived chain. Here there are echoes — and indeed a defence — of Martin Heidegger's "das Sein des Seinden", although Heller would probably have rejected these. This state of affairs leads to spiritual perdition, he felt, whereby man's own true significance as a higher being (his 'ontological mystery') is obscured, and whereby any attempt at a meaningful response to the world is stymied. For such a response can only take place "vis-à-vis" the question of what the world fundamentally "is", not simply how it works.
The meaningful response that the fully realised human being makes to the world differs from the attitude of the frog-in-the-well scientist in the most fundamental of ways: the former — through his theorising, which is the 'highest intellectual achievement' — actually shapes the Reality, rather than passively 'recording' it in the manner of the latter whose mere 'looking at a thing is of no use whatsoever'. Heller's best-known quotation is: "Be careful how you interpret the world; it "is" like that." The admonition is not addressed to those who 'find and accept' (as he put it), but to those who through the 'intuitive, visionary faculty of... [their] genius' essentially "create" the world we know.
Objections.
An objection levelled against "The Disinherited Mind" (and registered in the Postscript, Part 4 of the essay entitled "The Hazard of Modern Poetry," which Heller appended to the US edition of 1957) was that the "Weltanschauung" at the heart of its critique was in some aspects excessively "Holocaust-centric". (Heller took exception to this term, preferring the English word 'genocide', or the Semitic words "sho'ah" and "hurban" (Hebrew, 'annihilation'), to 'Holocaust'.)
Heller chose not to contest this charge. However, the book itself throws some light on this question. In the chapter 'Goethe and the Avoidance of Tragedy', a non-Jewish philosopher of stature, Karl Jaspers, is quoted on Goethe's having become – in an important sense – obsolete after 1945. This is on account of his inadequate grasp of the problems of theodicy, that is, chiefly, of the problem of the existence of Evil. The question posed is not whether the Holocaust was central to Erich Heller (as it was to all the Jews who survived), but whether any human being can avoid being conscious of its centrality.
For Heller, the Body was central to human identity. The Body was the "principium individuationis" (in the sense that Nietzsche understood or misunderstood that expression, which was good enough for Heller). He once confessed privately that it is precisely because religions like Christianity offered a redemption that, for him, entailed the greatest sacrilege – a divestiture of the Body in Paradise in favour of some 'transfigured' entity that seemed to merge the individual personhood, eschatologically speaking, into a single collective state of all the blessed – it is for this reason that he was not interested in those religions. The Holocaust had a theological dimension for him, also. With its mass destruction of bodies it violated the principle of the sacred, of the spiritual, as manifested in the world. For Heller, the spiritual was never a tissue of 'vague abstractions': it was always incarnate. The spiritual needed the Body in exactly the same measure in which it needed transcendence: the spiritual had to be 'known and felt to be real'. 'Genius' alone, he once wrote, 'is never the whole man'.
On Nietzsche.
Heller points out that Nietzsche's and Rilke's opposition to "valid" distinctions — in particular Nietzsche's "relativisation of Good and Evil" — was an over-reaction. It took against what both writers diagnosed as the 'barbarism of concepts' of a 'crudely interpreted world' (the expression is Nietzsche's), whereby the dual aspects of immanence and transcendence — closer to each other than human thought has been prepared to allow over the centuries — open the floodgates to a series of specious distinctions. Pre-eminent among the latter is the false distinction between thought and feeling. But, in their zeal to uncover the fraud of such bifurcations, the two thinkers carry their denunciation too far: Nietzsche, in particular, overstates his case when he links Good with Evil.
Borrowing.
In a critique of T. S. Eliot's views on Shakespeare – who supposedly modelled himself on Montaigne in formulating the character of Hamlet – Heller took a commonsensical approach to "literary borrowing". His position has broader applications. Eliot – Heller writes —
Heller adduces another case in point: 'If Dante's thought is Thomas Aquinas's, it is yet Dante's: not only by virtue of imaginative sympathy and assimilation, and certainly not as a reward for the supply of an "emotional equivalent" ["sc." in its unique capacity as poetry]. It is Dante's property by birthright. He has reborn it within himself –– poetically.'
The argument preempts criticism of Heller's philosophy, based on its roots in Nietzsche and Rilke, and ("mutatis mutandis") of Kafka. The title of "The Disinherited Mind" itself might have been suggested by Rilke's Seventh Elegy.
Other works; or the Last Days of Mankind.
Bibliographies are a dull business (as Erich Heller remarks in his 'The Last Days of Mankind'). "The Disinherited Mind" was followed by another collection of essays, "The Artist's Journey into the Interior" (1965; German ed., "Die Reise der Kunst ins Innere und andere Essays", 1966; Japanese translation, 1972); then by "The Poet's Self and the Poem: Essays on Goethe, Nietzsche, Rilke and Thomas Mann" (1976); and finally by "Im Zeitalter der Prosa: literarische und philosophische Essays", published simultaneously in German and in English editions (the latter under the title "In the Age of Prose: Literary and Philosophical Essays") in 1984.
Heller's early article on Karl Kraus, 'The Last Days of Mankind', was originally published in the "Cambridge Journal" in 1948, its title taken from one of Kraus's plays, "Die letzten Tage der Menschheit" (1919).
Writings on Nietzsche.
Heller's German-language "Nietzsche: 3 Essays" appeared in 1964, establishing him as an authority on Friedrich Nietzsche. An English-language collection of –– chiefly cross-cultural –– essays on the subject was brought out by the University of Chicago Press as "The Importance of Nietzsche" in 1988 to wide acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic. The collection was posthumously published in Germany four years later. His essay on 'Wittgenstein and Nietzsche' appears in "Portraits of Wittgenstein" (1999).
Heller also contributed an introduction to R. J. Hollingdale's (1930–2001) translation of Nietzsche's "Menschliches, Allzumenschliches" ("Human, All Too Human"), published by Cambridge University Press in 1986.
Writings on Thomas Mann.
Already in 1940, soon after his arrival at Cambridge, the 29-year-old Heller annotated a collection of Thomas Mann's short stories for a British publisher. Thomas Mann's writings were collectively the subject of Heller's doctoral dissertation, written under the supervision of Edwin Keppel Bennett (1887–1958), which was presented to the University of Cambridge (where, it may be noted, he was a member of Peterhouse and the Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages) in February 1949: in this work he considered Mann's "corpus" in relation to the main currents of thought in nineteenth-century Germany.
Heller's well-known study of Thomas Mann ("The Ironic German", 1958; German ed., "Thomas Mann, der ironische Deutsche", 1959; Jap. transl. (from the revised German), "Tômasu Man: hangoteki doitsu-jin", 1975) is based on information derived from his personal acquaintance of the subject. Gabriel Josipovici (b. 1940) called it in March 2006 one 'of the most important books in my intellectual formation'.
Later, Heller would also write an introduction to the 1972 reissue of Kenneth Burke's translation of Thomas Mann's "Der Tod in Venedig" (originally published in 1925), and to the American translation of Mann's "Wagner und unsere Zeit" (ed. Erika Mann).
Writings on Kafka; and the Question of Negative Transcendence.
Heller shared Franz Kafka's background. He also studied at the same university, in the same department, and took the same degree as did Kafka, 29 years before him. The essay on Kafka ("Kafka", London: Fontana Modern Masters, 1974; US ed., "Franz Kafka", New York, 1975) is still valuable for its author's synthesis of his subject's multifaceted, cross-pollinated mindset and cultural heritage. Decades before this essay was published Heller had used the expression negative transcendence, for which he is still remembered, to describe the particular quality of the visible reality adumbrated in Kafka's compositions, and particularly discernible in "The Castle".
In Kafka's world, contingent reality has been completely unhitched from the realm of the intelligible, from Truth that is—a positivistically ruled domain where the mutual causal relations between things preclude any reference to the transcendent in the elucidation of their meaning. Yet, it is the transcendent that constitutes a major part of that meaning (if indeed it does not exhaust it completely). In this situation, the meaning of reality methodically purged of what are taken to be illegitimate, because scientifically 'unprovable', elements becomes truncated, grossly incomplete, thereby producing a spiritual vacuum that, sealed off (as it were) 'from above', has no choice but to resolve the tension between the void and the plenum by sucking up 'from below' the stuff from Hell to replenish itself with. This is "negative transcendence". For where the positive values are suppressed, Evil will take over with the force and inevitability of a physical necessity. One might call it Heller's law.
Erich Heller had earlier been, famously, the co-editor of Kafka's love-letters addressed to Felice Bauer (1887–1960), the revealing 782-page "Briefe an Felice...", published in 1967, to which he wrote an introduction that became something of a classic in itself, being retained for the French translation of the correspondence in question. Subsequently, Heller also contributed an introduction to an English translation of "Der Prozess", and edited Kafka's "Der Dichter über sein Werk", and his "Über das Schreiben".
German writings.
A selection of his essays on Nietzsche, Thomas Mann, T. S. Eliot, and Karl Kraus appeared in Germany in 1977 under the title "Die Wiederkehr der Unschuld": this collection includes the beautiful essay 'Vom Menschen, der sich schämt' in which Erich Heller surveys the human attitude the Greeks called "aidos", as manifested in later history. "Die Wiederkehr der Unschuld" followed upon essays on Rilke, "Nirgends wird Welt sein als innen" (1975), and "Essays über Goethe", which saw the light of day in 1970. These in turn were preceded by his "Studien zur modernen Literatur" of 1963. His article 'Karl Kraus und die schwarze Magie der Sprache' appeared in "Der Monat" (VI/64) in 1954; while his paper on Rilke, 'Improvisationen zur ersten der Duineser Elegien', presented at a congress in Italy in 1982, is published in a collective volume.
Book series.
Heller was the general editor of Studies In Modern European Literature and Thought, a book series published from 1952 by Bowes &amp; Bowes, Cambridge.
Life in letters.
Heller corresponded with a number of thinkers of his day, whose names include (in the chronological order of the date of birth, not necessarily in the order of the respective correspondents' importance) the following.
Perhaps his most notable correspondent had been Hannah Arendt; perhaps, indeed.
Many important biographical details shared with him by other writers could only with the greatest difficulty, if at all, find their way into conventional studies and biographies, and remain hidden from public view (such as, for example, Thomas Mann's verbal confession, made to Heller, concerning the circumstances attending upon the destruction, by his own hand, of his early diaries [their homosexual content was the immediate cause], or another concerning his reading and re-reading of Xenophon's "Symposium" 'nine times' before writing his own narrative on love's vicissitudes, "Der Tod in Venedig").
Erich Heller's vivid intellect made him on occasion a principled controversialist, as evidenced by his long-running –– and sometimes acrimonious –– public exchanges with another prominent British Germanist, T. J. Reed, in the weekly pages of the "Times Literary Supplement" in the 1970s.
Private life.
Heller was a lifelong bachelor who cultivated several meaningful intellectual friendships, including with the Chicago writer Joseph Epstein. W. H. Auden is also known to have been an early friend.
Views on America.
Although he apparently never sought to become a citizen of the United States, a country where he spent upwards of a third of his life, Heller nevertheless had a deep respect for American democracy, which he felt embodied values directly opposed to those that informed the political realities of the Central Europe he fled in 1939. This pietistic stance however never prevented him from espousing views considered by the mainstream opinion in America to be outdated or otherwise 'politically incorrect' whenever he thought them valid on objective grounds; nor did he shrink from considering America an intellectual desert.
The Heidegger Question.
Much interested in the thought of Nietzsche and Wittgenstein (he contributed a 'Vorwort zum "Tractatus logico-philosophicus), Heller had also a natural attraction for the basic issues raised by Martin Heidegger in his works on Being, which were directly relevant to his own reflections on the nature of Reality. An obstacle to a deeper analysis of Heidegger's "œuvre" was presented by that writer's questionable but imperfectly explored association with National Socialism. At an early stage in his life Heller, in a bid to 'absolve' Heidegger in his own mind, went so far as to undertake a special trip to post-war Germany to meet the renowned philosopher in person; but his 'Why?' was met by stony silence. The encounter seemed to convince Heller that there was little one could add, by way of moral comment on Heidegger, that has not been expressed in Paul Celan's poem 'Todtnauberg', written later but in similar circumstances, with its well-known "topos" of suffocation at what Celan calls "Krudes" (an instance of smuttiness).
This turn of events must needs be adjudged a most unfortunate one, given that much of Heller's best thought can be viewed as a continuation in one sense or another of Heidegger's preoccupation with Being; certainly Heidegger's "Sein und Zeit", in its original edition, was a prized possession and remained part of Heller's personal library to his last day (surviving the substantial paring down of his collection upon his moving into a retirement home in the final stages of his life). It is possible, and indeed probable, that if the outcome of his meeting with Heidegger, which might have taken place "c".1947, had been more positive in providing answers to some of the burning questions, the final shape of "The Disinherited Mind", Heller's first book, would have been substantially different, and that we would have been presented therein with manifold instances of direct engagement with Heidegger's propositions. As things stand, there are just a couple of perfunctory references to Heidegger in this, "nolens volens", most 'Heideggerian' of books. (Those references do nevertheless reveal intimate acquaintance with his thought.) Just as Heidegger had not a single word for Heller during their meeting, so also he has barely a word to spare for Heidegger.
"Festschrift".
On his 65th birthday in 1976 (the year of Heidegger's death) Erich Heller was presented with a commemorative volume of Goethe studies written in his honour, entitled "Versuche zu Goethe" (ed. Volker Dürr and Géza von Molnár), which includes an extensive bibliography of his own works.
Another tribute from an unexpected quarter came five years later from the aforementioned Hans Egon Holthusen (see Life in Letters, above), who also taught at Northwestern between 1968 and 1981, and who, despite the criticisms meted out to him in "The Disinherited Mind", delivered himself of a 'Geburtstagsgruß an Erich Heller' in "Merkur" (35, 1981; pp. 340–342) on the occasion of Heller's 70th birthday. From a more critical perspective, a 2021 essay in the Journal of Austrian-American History presents an overview of Heller's career and work based in part on research carried out with the assistance of the Heller papers at Northwestern University.
Death.
Erich Heller died on 5 November 1990 in a retirement home in Evanston, Illinois. He was 79. His body was subsequently cremated. His library, including the complete set of the Musarion-"Ausgabe" of Nietzsche's works with which he never parted during his lifetime, became dispersed among second-hand bookshops.
Heller's personal papers, including private correspondence and manuscripts, are preserved in parts at the Northwestern University Archives in Evanston, and in parts at the Deutsches Literaturarchiv (Schiller-Nationalmuseum) in the southwestern German city of Marbach am Neckar (Baden-Württemberg). The files of the Northwestern University Archives contain some photographs. The Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., for its part, holds facsimiles of some of his letters (in particular those addressed to Hannah Arendt and Robert B. Silvers), in addition to the sound recordings of two of his lectures, the one on 'The Modern German Mind: The Legacy of Nietzsche', which he delivered in the Coolidge Auditorium of the Library of Congress on 8 February 1960, the other on 'The Works of Nietzsche', recorded in 1974.
In 2015, Random House published "Reading Claudius: A Memoir in Two Parts" by Erich Heller's niece, Caroline, the daughter of his brother Paul. In the book, Caroline Heller writes of her father, mother, and uncle's lives in pre-war Prague, emphasizing the rich mix of the cultural, literary, and political before the Nazi invasion. She writes of her mother and uncle's escape from Prague as Hitler's power grew, as well as Paul Heller's arrest by the Gestapo the night Hitler invaded Poland. "Reading Claudius" uses excerpts from Paul Heller's writings to chronicle his six years subsequent years in Buchenwald and Auschwitz. "Reading Claudius" received praise from the Sunday "New York Times" Book Review and the "Boston Globe", among other newspapers and journals.
Erich Heller lacks an entry in the "Encyclopædia Britannica", as he does in Bautz' "Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon", although he does command a mention in the "Brockhaus Enzyklopädie".

Ordinary Mind Zen School

The Ordinary Mind Zen School is a network of independent Zen centers established by Charlotte Joko Beck and her Dharma Successors in 1995.
History.
The school is unaffiliated with any Zen centers which fall outside of its own network, however many Ordinary Mind Zen teachers are members of the White Plum Asanga. The history of the Ordinary Mind Zen School dates back to 1983, which was the year that Joko Beck had left the Zen Center of Los Angeles. That was the year her teacher, Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi, had been confronted by his students about his alcoholism and sexual liaisons with some female students. Joko Beck established the Zen Center of San Diego in 1983.
According to Richard Hughes Seager, "By 1998, the Ordinary Mind School had centers in San Diego, Champaign, Illinois, Oakland, California, Portland, Oregon and New York City." There is no one set structure of curriculum in the Ordinary Mind School, as the Dharma Successors of Joko Beck get to decide their method of training independent of any organizational head. Long before retirement, Joko Beck had done away with all titles and no longer wore her okesa. (For formal occasions she often wore a rakusu after ceasing to wear okesa; she also ordained several Zen priests throughout her life.) She had distanced herself considerably from her roots in the Sōtō school, and much of the ceremony had been abandoned in favor of pure meditation practice.
Teachers.
Note that Joko wrote a letter saying that she revoked transmission for two teachers she gave transmission to: Ezra Bayda and Elizabeth Hamilton. However it is unclear if Joko or anyone had the authority to revoke transmission.

Ted Breitenstein

Theodore P. ("Ted" or "Breit") Breitenstein (June 1, 1869 – May 3, 1935) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher from St. Louis, Missouri who played from to for the St. Louis Browns/Cardinals and the Cincinnati Reds. He is best known for throwing a no-hitter in his first Major League start, along with the "Pretzel Battery" with fellow German-American battery mate Heinie Peitz.
Major League Baseball career.
During his first season in the majors, Breitenstein pitched occasionally in relief, but on the final day of the 1891 season, October 4, Breitenstein was allowed to start and he pitched a no-hitter against the Louisville Colonels, an 8–0 victory. He faced the minimum number of batters of 27, allowed just one base on balls, which was erased by a double play or by a pickoff play. It was also the last no-hitter thrown in the American Association, as the league folded after the season.
Breitenstein became part of the pitching rotation in , but had a lackluster season with a 9–19 win–loss record and a 4.69 earned run average. He turned his pitching around after that, and in , his 3.18 ERA was tops in the National League. In , he won 27 games while leading the league in games started, complete games and innings pitched, although he led the league in runs allowed, and had a 4.79 ERA. In the following season, his workload stayed the same, leading the league in games started and complete games once again, but his stats took a slide downward, leading the league in runs allowed, base on balls, and losses. His 30 losses in ranks third on the all-time list for losses in a season by a pitcher.
After a similar season in , Breitenstein was sold to the Cincinnati Reds. The move gave him a new start and he took advantage of it, winning more than 20 games in each of his first two season with the Reds. He lowered his ERA to 3.62 in and 3.42 in respectively. On April 22, 1898, he pitched his second no-hitter, this time against the Pittsburgh Pirates, an 11–0 victory. What made this no-hitter notable is the fact that another no-hitter was pitched on the same day. Jay Hughes of the Baltimore Orioles threw one against the Boston Beaneaters. This was the first occurrence of two no-hitters being thrown on the same day in the major leagues.
Breitenstein's next two seasons in Cincinnati were respectable, but his skills had shown that they were declining, not able to pitch with the same durability of seasons past. Through an unknown transaction, he returned to his old team in St. Louis, now known as the Cardinals. His MLB career ended after only a few games in .
Later life.
Breitenstein went on to a lengthy minor league baseball career, most notably with the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association. He played eight seasons for the Pelicans, ten years in all with the Association. He was then an umpire in the Association. During World War I, Breitenstein was named as a director of an athletic camp especially organized for Army and Navy soldiers. He died in St. Louis, Missouri at the age of 65, and is interred in Saint Peter's Cemetery in Normandy, Missouri.

Autler–Townes effect

In spectroscopy, the Autler–Townes effect (also known as AC Stark effect), is a dynamical Stark effect corresponding to the case when an oscillating electric field (e.g., that of a laser) is tuned in resonance (or close) to the transition frequency of a given spectral line, and resulting in a change of the shape of the absorption/emission spectra of that spectral line. The AC Stark effect was discovered in 1955 by American physicists Stanley Autler and Charles Townes.
It is the AC equivalent of the static Stark effect which splits the spectral lines of atoms and molecules in a constant electric field. Compared to its DC counterpart, the AC Stark effect is computationally more complex.
While generally referring to atomic spectral shifts due to AC fields at any (single) frequency, the effect is more pronounced when the field frequency is close to that of a natural atomic or molecular dipole transition. In this case, the alternating field has the effect of splitting the two bare transition states into doublets or "dressed states" that are separated by the Rabi frequency. Alternatively, this can be described as a Rabi oscillation between the bare states which are no longer eigenstates of the atom–field Hamiltonian. The resulting fluorescence spectrum is known as a Mollow triplet.
The AC Stark splitting is integral to several phenomena in quantum optics, such as electromagnetically induced transparency and Sisyphus cooling. Vacuum Rabi oscillations have also been described as a manifestation of the AC Stark effect from atomic coupling to the vacuum field.
History.
The AC Stark effect was discovered in 1955 by American physicists Stanley Autler and Charles Townes while at Columbia University and Lincoln Labs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before the availability of lasers, the AC Stark effect was observed with radio frequency sources. Autler and Townes' original observation of the effect used a radio frequency source tuned to 12.78 and 38.28 MHz, corresponding to the separation between two doublet microwave absorption lines of OCS.
The notion of quasi-energy in treating the general AC Stark effect was later developed by Nikishov and Ritis in 1964 and onward. This more general method of approaching the problem developed into the "dressed atom" model describing the interaction between lasers and atoms.
Prior to the 1970s there were various conflicting predictions concerning the fluorescence spectra of atoms due to the AC Stark effect at optical frequencies. In 1974 the observation of Mollow triplets verified the form of the AC Stark effect using visible light.
General semiclassical approach.
In a semiclassical model where the electromagnetic field is treated classically, a system of charges in a monochromatic electromagnetic field has a Hamiltonian that can be written as:
where formula_2, formula_3, formula_4 and formula_5 are respectively the position, momentum, mass, and charge of the formula_6-th particle, and formula_7 is the speed of light. The vector potential of the field, formula_8, satisfies
The Hamiltonian is thus also 
periodic:
Now, the Schrödinger equation, under a periodic Hamiltonian is a linear homogeneous differential equation with periodic coefficients,
where formula_12 here represents all coordinates. 
Floquet's theorem guarantees that the solutions to an equation of this form can be written as
Here, formula_14 is the "bare" energy for no coupling to the electromagnetic field, and formula_15 has the same time-periodicity as the Hamiltonian,
or
with formula_18 the angular frequency of the field.
Because of its periodicity, it is often further useful to expand formula_19 in a Fourier series, obtaining
or
where formula_22 is the frequency of the laser field.
The solution for the joint particle-field system is, therefore, a linear combination of stationary states of energy formula_23, which is known as a "quasi-energy" state and the new set of energies are called the "spectrum of quasi-harmonics".
Unlike the DC Stark effect, where perturbation theory is useful in a general case of atoms with infinite bound states, obtaining even a limited spectrum of shifted energies for the AC Stark effect is difficult in all but simple models, although calculations for systems such as the hydrogen atom have been done.
Examples.
General expressions for AC Stark shifts must usually be calculated numerically and tend to provide little insight. However, there are important individual examples of the effect that are informative. Analytical solutions in these specific cases are usually obtained assuming the detuning formula_24 is small compared to a characteristic frequency of the radiating system.
Two level atom dressing.
An atom driven by an electric field with frequency formula_25 close to an atomic transition frequency formula_26 (that is, when formula_27) can be approximated as a two level quantum system since the off resonance states have low occupation probability. The Hamiltonian can be divided into the bare atom term plus a term for the interaction with the field as:
In an appropriate rotating frame, and making the rotating wave approximation, formula_29 reduces to
Where formula_31 is the Rabi frequency, and formula_32 are the strongly coupled bare atom states. The energy eigenvalues are
and for small detuning,
The eigenstates of the atom-field system or dressed states are dubbed formula_35 and formula_36.
The result of the AC field on the atom is thus to shift the strongly coupled bare atom energy eigenstates into two states formula_35 and formula_36 which are now separated by formula_39. Evidence of this shift is apparent in the atom's absorption spectrum, which shows two peaks around the bare transition frequency, separated by formula_31 (Autler-Townes splitting). The modified absorption spectrum can be obtained by a pump-probe experiment, wherein a strong "pump" laser drives the bare transition while a weaker "probe" laser sweeps for a second transition between a third atomic state and the dressed states.
Another consequence of the AC Stark splitting here is the appearance of Mollow triplets, a triple peaked fluorescence profile. Historically an important confirmation of Rabi flopping, they were first predicted by Mollow in 1969 and confirmed in the 1970s experimentally.
Optical Dipole Trap (Far-Off-Resonance Trap).
For ultracold atoms experiments utilizing the optical dipole force from AC Stark shift, the light is usually linearly polarized to avoid the splitting of different magnetic substates with different formula_41, and the light frequency is often far detuned from the atomic transition to avoid heating the atoms from the photon-atom scattering; in turn, the intensity of the light field (i.e. AC electric field) formula_42 is typically high to compensate for the large detuning. Typically, we have formula_43, where the atomic transition has a natural linewidth formula_44 and a saturation intensity:
Note the above expression for saturation intensity does not apply to all cases. For example, the above applies for the D2 line transition of Li-6, but not the D1 line, which obeys a different sum rule in calculating the oscillator strength. As a result, the D1 line has a saturation intensity 3 times larger than the D2 line. However, when the detuning from these two lines is much larger than the fine-structure splitting, the overall saturation intensity takes the value of the D2 line. In the case where the light's detuning is comparable to the fine-structure splitting but still much larger than the hyperfine splitting, the D2 line contributes twice as much dipole potential as the D1 line, as shown in Equation (19) of.
The optical dipole potential is therefore:
Here, the Rabi frequency formula_31 is related to the (dimensionless) saturation parameter formula_48, and formula_49 is the real part of the complex polarizability of the atom, with its imaginary counterpart representing the dissipative optical scattering force. The factor of 1/2 takes into account that the dipole moment is an induced, not a permanent one.
When formula_27, the rotating wave approximation applies, and the counter-rotating term proportional to formula_51 can be omitted; However, in some cases, the ODT light is so far detuned that counter-rotating term must be included in calculations, as well as contributions from adjacent atomic transitions with appreciable linewidth formula_44.
Note that the natural linewidth formula_44 here is in radians per second, and is the inverse of lifetime formula_54. This is the principle of operation for Optical Dipole Trap (ODT, also known as Far Off Resonance Trap, FORT), in which case the light is red-detuned formula_55. When blue-detuned, the light beam provides a potential bump/barrier instead.
The optical dipole potential is often expressed in terms of the recoil energy, which is the kinetic energy imparted in an atom initially at rest by "recoil" during the spontaneous emission of a photon:
where formula_57 is the wavevector of the ODT light (formula_58 when detuned). The recoil energy, along with related recoil frequency formula_59, are crucial parameters in understanding the dynamics of atoms in light fields, especially in the context of atom optics and momentum transfer.
In applications that utilize the optical dipole force, it is common practice to use a far-off-resonance light frequency. This is because a smaller detuning would increase the photon-atom scattering rate much faster than it increases the dipole potential energy, leading to undesirable heating of the atoms. Quantitatively, the scattering rate is given by:
Adiabatic elimination.
In quantum system with three (or more) states, where a transition from one level, formula_61 to another formula_62 can be driven by an AC field, but formula_62 only decays to states other than formula_61, the dissipative influence of the spontaneous decay can be eliminated. This is achieved by increasing the AC Stark shift on formula_61 through large detuning and raising intensity of the driving field. Adiabatic elimination has been used to create comparatively stable effective two level systems in Rydberg atoms, which are of interest for qubit manipulations in quantum computing.
Electromagnetically induced transparency.
Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which gives some materials a small transparent area within an absorption line, can be thought of as a combination of Autler-Townes splitting and Fano interference, although the distinction may be difficult to determine experimentally. While both Autler-Townes splitting and EIT can produce a transparent window in an absorption band, EIT refers to a window that maintains transparency in a weak pump field, and thus requires Fano interference. Because Autler-Townes splitting will wash out Fano interference at stronger fields, a smooth transition between the two effects is evident in materials exhibiting EIT.

Originally nicknamed "little foot" in 1995 when four ankle bones in a museum collection were sufficient to ascertain that the individual had been able to walk upright, the remainder of the skeleton was, subsequently, located in the cave from which the ankle bones had been collected.
Because the bones were completely embedded in concrete-like rock, their extremely difficult and tedious extraction took around 15 years. The bones proved to be the most complete skeleton of the early hominin lineage leading to humans, with 90% of the body being recovered. 
Dating of the specimen has proved controversial, with estimates ranging from 2.2 to 3.5 million years old, and its taxonomic placement is likewise disputed.
Discovery.
Four ankle bones of this specimen were collected in 1980 but were unidentified among numerous other mammal bones. Only after 1992, on initiative by Phillip Tobias, a large rock was blown up in the cave that contained an unusual accumulation of fossils. The fossils recovered were taken from the cave and scrutinized thoroughly by paleoanthropologist Ronald J. Clarke.
In 1994 while searching through museum boxes labelled 'Cercopithecoids' containing fossil fragments, Ronald J. Clarke identified several that were unmistakably hominin. He spotted four left foot bones (the talus, navicular, medial cuneiform and first metatarsal) that were most likely from the same individual. These fragments came from the Silberberg Grotto, a large cavern within the Sterkfontein cave system. They were described as belonging to the genus "Australopithecus," and catalogued as Stw 573.
Due to the diminutive nature of the bones, they were dubbed "Little Foot". Clarke found further foot bones from the same individual in separate bags in 1997, including a right fragment of the distal tibia that had been clearly sheared off from the rest of the bone. Early in 1997 two fossil preparators and assistants of Clarke, Stephen Motsumi and Nkwane Molefe, were sent to the Silberberg Grotto to try to find the matching piece of tibia from which the museum specimen had been broken.
Amazingly, within two days, they found the remaining part of the bone protruding from the rock in the lower part of the grotto. Though only the bones of both legs were visible, because they were in anatomically correct arrangement the team speculated that it could be a complete skeleton that was embedded with the face downward in the limestone.
In the following months, Clarke and his two assistants with the help of a hammer and small chisel uncovered further foot bones. Stephen Motsumi discovered the first remains of the upper body, an upper arm bone on 11 September 1998, and eventually the head of the individual was seen as well. It was a skull connected with the lower jaw, which was facing up. These were announced to the press in 1998, resulting in considerable media attention around the world.
A year later, in July and August 1999, a left forearm as well as the corresponding left hand were discovered and partly uncovered. These were again in anatomically correct arrangement. Subsequent work has uncovered a relatively complete skeleton, including parts of the pelvis, ribs and vertebrae, a complete humerus and most of the lower limb bones.
At the time, it was recognized that it was likely to be far more complete than the famous "Australopithecus afarensis" skeleton, "Lucy", from the site of Hadar, Ethiopia. Clarke reported this discovery six months later and explained that all previous analyses indicated that the fossil's body was apparently complete and was possibly slightly moved by ground movements and also not damaged by predators. It took Clarke and his team two full decades to fully extricate, clean, and analyze the specimen, work that was finally completed in 2017.
Characteristics.
StW 573 (Little Foot) is a nearly complete case of an Australopithecus female specimen, including the skull, that provides plenty of information on this once obscure species that helps advance perspective on them. In the discovery of the cast, there was evidence of dental use where it shows to be prominent. Resemblances can be drawn to other cases found in South Africa, such as that of A. afarensis. The specimen is a female, 1.20-1.30 meters tall, whose lower limbs are longer than its upper limbs. Its hips are modern and capable of transmitting great force from its legs, and its hands are very large. Its body suggests a bipedal gait and, at the same time, that it had a great ability to climb trees. Morphological characteristics of StW 573's fossil are the complete limb lengths that demonstrate that StW 573 stood roughly to the height of 4 feet and that it exhibited forms of bipedalism due to the length of its legs. Although, StW 573 also prominently displays many features that other apes present such as an S-shaped curve in its collarbone along with a ventral bar. Other fragments of the cast such as the pectoral girdle and the high ridge of StW 573's shoulder blades suggest that it had a strong upper body to support its weight while it hung from branches and climbed trees. Overall this cast shows characteristics found in both human and other primates as it exhibits signs of walking upright, early bipedalism, and locomotion through the trees.
Classification.
First, the discovery (archive No. STW 573) was not assigned to any particular species in the genus "Australopithecus". In the first description in July 1995 it was said, "The bones are probably an early member of "Australopithecus africanus" or another early species of hominids". After 1998, when a part of the skull had been discovered and uncovered, Clarke pointed out now that the fossils were probably associated with the genus "Australopithecus", but whose 'unusual features' do not match any "Australopithecus" species previously described.
Clarke now suggests that Little Foot does not belong to the species "Australopithecus afarensis" or "Australopithecus africanus", but to a unique "Australopithecus" species previously found at Makapansgat and Sterkfontein Member Four, "Australopithecus prometheus". However, this name is a "nomen nudum".
Following the discovery of the approximately two million year old "Australopithecus sediba", which had been discovered just 15 km away from Sterkfontein in the Malapa northern cave in the year 2008, the assumption was made that an ancestor of "Australopithecus" could be "sediba". As with any new discovery, there is always an argument between the lumpers and splitters. 
Dating.
Due to the lack of volcanic layers at the site, dating was difficult. An estimated date was published in 1995, which was based on relative dating of old world monkeys and some carnivores. The dates ranged from 3.0- 3.5 million years old, and it was due to this that the fossils were described as the oldest known representative of hominids in South Africa.
This date was heavily criticized in 1996 and was thought to have been dated too early. A second analysis put the date around 2.5 million years old and was more widely accepted. Another study on Little Foot came to a similar conclusion in 2002, revising its age at "younger than 3 million".
The controversial dating on this fossil is primarily due to the age of formation of the rocks that surrounded its fossilized skeleton. The reason for the 2.2 million years dating is primarily caused by the age of flowstones that surrounded the skeleton. These flowstones filled voids from ancient erosion and collapse and formed around 2.2 million years ago, however the skeleton is thought to be older.
The Little Foot specimen dating made in 2015, estimates it to 3.67 million years old by means of a new radioisotopic technique. Results in 2014 estimated the specimen to be around 3.3 million years old. Earlier attempts date it 2.2 million years, or between 3.03 and 2.04 million years.
How "Little Foot" lived.
In 1995, the first description of the four first discovered foot bones was published. The authors explained that this "Australopithecus" specimen walked upright but was also able to live in trees with the help of grasping movements. This would be possible due to the still opposable big toe.
The construction of the foot differs only slightly from a chimpanzee. Clarke saw foot bones discovered in 1998 which confirmed this initial assessment. His description, according to the known Laetoli footprints of "Australopithecus" and the arrangement of the foot bones discovered in the Silberberg Grotto, exhibits a high degree of compliance.
In his 1999 description of the fossil bones of the hand, Clarke pointed out that the length of the palm of the hand as well as the length of the finger bone was significantly shorter than that of chimpanzees and gorillas. The hand was like that of modern humans, known as relatively unspecialized.
Referring to predator finds, who lived at the time of the "Australopithecus" in Africa, Clarke joined the view of Jordi Sabater who in 1997 had argued that sleeping on the ground at night was too dangerous for "Australopithecus". He believed it seemed more likely that "Australopithecus" slept in the trees, similar to today's living chimpanzees and gorillas that make sleeping nests. Due to the features of the fossil, he also believed it likely that "Australopithecus" spent parts of their days searching for food in the trees.
At the end of 2008, Clarke published a reconstruction of the circumstances which allowed the fossil to remain so unusually well preserved in contrast to other bones found in the same cave, which apparently had been washed over longer periods of time in their final storage location. The fossil also shows no damage by predators so the assumption can be made that the fossils were not moved to the cave by predators to be fed on. However, individual bones are broken, which possibly can be traced back to the quarry work in the early 20th century. The opening could have become clogged with materials such as rocks, so no water could penetrate and wash away the bones of the remaining carcass.

Daydreamin' (Lupe Fiasco song)

"Daydreamin'" is the third single taken from Lupe Fiasco's album "Lupe Fiasco's Food &amp; Liquor" (2006) and features soul singer Jill Scott. The song won Best Urban/Alternative Performance at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, earning Fiasco his first Grammy and Scott's third.
Background.
The single is based on a sample of "Daydream" by the Günter Kallmann Choir, (Which itself is a cover, the original being written by The Wallace Collection). The song's lyrics depict an adventure being experienced through the eyes of a robot. The song's lyrics are also a critique of pop culture, especially of the current state of hip hop music.
The song was released in the UK and US on September 11, 2006; however, a download-only version was available one week earlier and charted at #46 (without any physical sales).
In 2008 "Daydreamin'" won the Grammy Award for Best Urban/Alternative Performance. It was ranked the best rap song of 2006 by many publications. "Daydreamin'" featured in a 2008 AT&amp;T commercial for a Samsung phone.
In January 2022, Lupe Fiasco revealed that producer &amp; CEO of Atlantic Records Craig Kallman forced the song onto Fiasco's "Food and Liquor" album "or it wasn't coming out". Fiasco also revealed that he receives no royalties or revenue from the Grammy-winning song.
Music video.
A music video was created for the song; it shows Lupe Fiasco at a record store, where he meets and befriends a robot. Jill Scott is shown in a video projected on the wall, singing with a flower in her hair in a manner reminiscent of Billie Holiday.
Remixes.
Young Buck did a freestyle remix over the instrumental to this song, and is the first track, featured on "G-Unit Radio Pt. 24: The Clean Up Man".
Chamillionaire made a remix on his Mixtape Messiah 7.
Charts.
The song was not a major success on the "Billboard" charts, but it did begin to pick up steam on the digital download charts, peaking at #26 on the iTunes hip-hop/rap charts and #32 on the Amazon hip-hop/rap charts as of May 1, 2008.
In popular culture.
A further remixed version is used in the 2016 episode "eps2.0_unm4sk-pt1.tc" in Season 2 of the series "Mr. Robot".

Colerne Airfield

Colerne Airfield , now known as Azimghur Barracks, is a British Army facility just north-west of the village of Colerne, Wiltshire, England. It is set to close in 2029.
History.
RAF Colerne was opened on this site in 1940, and was in operation until 1976. From 1940 to 1955, RAF Fighter Command units were based here. During the Battle of Britain, the airfield served as a satellite field to RAF Middle Wallop, and squadrons rotated back and forth from there on a daily basis.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Azimghur Barracks was used as a training depot by the Royal Corps of Transport's and The Royal Army Ordnance Junior Leaders Regiment.
Present day.
The site is a ground station for the Skynet 5 military satellite system that provides battlefield support (e.g. real-time imagery from remote-piloted drones in various theatres of war). It is in close proximity to the underground Corsham Computer Centre.
The Azimghur Barracks part of the site is home to 21 Signal Regiment.
Since November 1992, the airfield is used by Air Cadets and 3 Air Experience Flight, and was the headquarters of Bristol University Air Squadron, a Volunteer Reserve unit which recruits from several universities in south-west England, before their move to MoD Boscome down in 2022 
Future.
In November 2016, the Ministry of Defence announced that the airfield would close in 2018 (later extended to 2029), and Azimghur Barracks in 2031 (later brought forward to 2029).

Oban Airport

Oban Airport is located northeast of Oban, near the village of North Connel, Argyll and Bute, Scotland. Operated by Argyll and Bute council, it has a CAA licence as a commercial airport following recent upgrading. Currently Hebridean Air Services is the only airline based at Oban. It operates scheduled flights on two routes, to the Isles of Colonsay and Islay return and to the Isles of Coll and Tiree return.
Sightseeing flights also operate out of Oban Airport with trips around the Loch Linnhe area. Flights include sites such as Oban, the Gulf of Corryvreckan, Tobermory, Castle Stalker and The Bridge over the Atlantic.
Oban airport links the mainland with the islands of Coll, Colonsay, Islay and Tiree. The airstrips on the Islands of Coll and Colonsay, also operated by Argyll and Bute council, have benefitted from extensive upgrading to enable them to attain CAA licensing in 2008 to allow for commercial traffic. Scheduled flights began in 2008.
History.
The site was previously RAF Connel a former Royal Air Force emergency landing ground that was operational between 1942 and 1945 during the Second World War. The airfield was operated by No. 17 Group RAF of RAF Coastal Command featuring two tarmaced runways and also used to support RAF Oban, a seaplane base nearby.
Incidents.
In April 2007, three people were killed after their light aircraft crashed after take-off from the airport. Their destination was Andrewsfield Aerodrome, England.
Controversy.
There has been controversy about the running of the airport by Argyll and Bute Council, mainly in the letters and news pages of "The Oban Times". It is claimed that costs have soared and the amount of traffic dropped since the takeover. In 2008, police looked into the possible sabotage of an airport fire appliance.
There was further controversy in July 2009 when Argyll Aero Club 'PK' erected a fence around the land that it leases from the airport. The council claimed this reduced the length of the runway meaning fixed wing ambulance flights cannot land.

Brough Aerodrome

Brough Aerodrome was a private use aerodrome located at Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is now disused with the last known flight out of the airfield occurring in 2011. The airfield closed in 2013. The site is now crossed by a new road "Baffin Way" serving the town.
History.
The site was first used in 1916 by the Blackburn Aeroplane &amp; Motor Company during the First World War for the testing of seaplanes.
Brough played its part in preparing fighter pilots for the Battle of Britain. Yorkshire members of The Fewincluding local Spitfire pilot Ronald Berry and, for a short spell, high-scoring fighter ace James "Ginger" Laceyhoned their flying skills whilst at the Brough Flying Training School on Blackburn B-2 biplanes.
In 1949, the Blackburn Aeroplane &amp; Motor Company changed its name to Blackburn &amp; General Aircraft Limited and built a number of aircraft at Brough, including the Blackburn Beverley transport aircraft and the Blackburn Buccaneer maritime strike aircraft.
Between 1949 and 1957, the perimeter track of the Aerodrome was used as a race track, known famously as the venue of Stirling Moss's first win. The track went under the name of Brough Circuit.
In the 1960s, the company became part of Hawker Siddeley Aviation and the site continued with the production of the Buccaneer.
The company became part of British Aerospace and later BAE Systems and the site continues to build and support military aircraft. Until the end of production, BAE Harrier jump jets were built at Brough. The airfield closed in the early 1990s after the daily shuttle flights to BAe Warton ended due to cost-cutting. Continuing to this day, variants of the BAe Hawk are built at Brough.
On 7 September 2007, however, the company announced that it intended to fly all future Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer aircraft from Brough to Warton at a rate of two per month. On 28 January 2008, flying resumed with the take-off of a demonstration version of the Hawk. At the end of April 2009, an F-35 Lightning II static test airframe arrived at Brough Aerodrome. It was the first such aircraft to be delivered to the UK.
A £2.5 billion deal to provide Typhoons and Hawks to Oman extended Brough's work backlog to 2016, with hopes of further lucrative export deals to come.

Mary Wilson (album)

Mary Wilson is the debut solo album by the founding Supremes member, Mary Wilson, released on the Motown label in 1979.
Background.
In October 1976, The Supremes had released their 29th and last studio album, "Mary, Scherrie &amp; Susaye", just nine months before they officially disbanded as a group.
On June 12, 1977, the Supremes performed their farewell concert at the Theatre Royal in London as Wilson made her exit for a solo career. Scherrie and Susaye had selected Joyce Vincent Wilson to round out the trio as a new third member, however, Motown decided that without any original members, the Supremes would be disbanded.
Upon leaving the Supremes, Wilson became involved in a protracted legal battle with Motown Records over its management of the Supremes. After an out-of-court settlement, she signed a solo record deal with Motown negotiated by her husband, Pedro Ferrer. Her contract required her to record two LP's per year for the next five years. According to an interview Ferrer did for "Black Echoes" magazine, Wilson's contract was worth a million dollars a year for each of those five years. Her husband also mentioned in the interview that Marvin Gaye was scheduled to produce the album. However, Gaye was preoccupied with his divorce from Berry Gordy's elder sister Anna Gordy during the time. It is not clear why Gaye never took part in the album production.
Wilson's debut solo effort ended up being produced by Hal Davis who produced some of The Supremes earlier material as well as having worked with The Jackson 5 and with Michael Jackson on his early solo albums for Motown.
Prior to the release of the album the infamous Disco Demolition Night took place at Comiskey Park in Chicago on July 12, 1979. Despite the radio ads and label promotion, the "Disco Sucks" movement impacted the release which heavily featured disco. The album was a commercial failure and did not chart on the Billboard 200 but charted for a week at #74 on its R&amp;B albums listing. "Cashbox" magazine however charted it for five weeks on its pop albums chart, peaking at #168. Its lead single, "Red Hot", "Billboard" placed on the R&amp;B singles chart at #95. The follow up single, "Pick Up the Pieces", did not chart. An extended version of "Red Hot" was made available as a 12-inch single and reached #85 on the disco charts in October 1979.
Wilson made her U.S. solo concert debut at the New York, New York Club in Manhattan with Diana Ross in attendance lending her support. only a few weeks following the album's release. The concert was held from August 28 to September 3. She also embarked on her first solo tour of the United Kingdom booked with club and cabaret venues to promote the album. The tour was later extended.
In an interview with "Cashbox": Wilson described herself as "basically a ballad singer, "although some disco cuts are included on her album. But, she says, that's really nothing new. "I firmly believe," she stressed, "that disco has been done by Motown for years." As for the transition from back-up singer to soloist, she says, hasn't been difficult. "It's really no different if you've had the stage experience. There's just more words to learn." But there have been painful transitions in her life, and she admits that "leaving the Supremes was the hardest thing I had to do. I was very proud of that tradition, it was like the Beatles, and I'll always be proud of it." 
After the release of "Mary Wilson", Wilson began working on her second solo album for Motown with English record producer Gus Dudgeon (who had already produced 4 new tracks for the new album). However, midway through the production of the album, Motown dropped Wilson from their roster in 1980.
Wilson's next album, "Walk the Line", would take some 13-years before being released in 1992.
A posthumous EP, entitled "Mary Wilson: Red Hot Eric Kupper Remix EP", was released September 3, 2021. The EP featured three new different dance versions of Wilson's 1979 "Red Hot" single produced by Kupper.
Critical reception.
In a contemporary review, "Cashbox" published:
'This is the first solo LP from the ex -Supreme and she fares well on this disco oriented excursion.The album is chock full of emotionally charged dance numbers and intense R&amp;B workouts. Art Wright's rhythm, horn and string arrangements are perfectly suited to Wilson's soaring vocals. The energetic "Red Hot," the spirited "Midnight Dancer" and "(Love A) Warm Summer Night," with its moving rhumba beat, are the key cuts on this LP.'
In separate, contemporary reviews, "Record World" published:
'The last of the original Supremes makes her solo debut with a Hal Davis produced LP of seven dance oriented tunes. Ms. Wilson finely displays her skills on "Red Hot," her current single, and "(I Love A) Warm Summer Night."'
'As everyone must know by now, Wilson was one of the founders (and longest member) of the Supremes and her vocals are instantly identifiable after years of recording. This first solo album is a slickly executed disco disc featuring tunes by the writing duo of Frank Busey and John Durate. The opener "Red Hot" seems like a natural.'
Track listing.
All tracks composed by Frank Busey and John Duarte
Expanded Edition.
Two days prior to her death, Mary announced on her YouTube Channel that she was working with Universal in re-releasing her solo LP; expanding it with the four Gus Dudgeon tracks. A new song entitled, "Why Can't We All Get Along", previously unreleased was included on the expanded edition and released as a posthumous single on March 5, 2021 ahead of the album re-release. The expanded edition was released on April 16, 2021 marking its official debut on all digital platforms such as Spotify and iTunes.
The Motown Anthology.
In October, 2021, Real Gone Music in partnership with Second Disc Records announced a physical compilation to be released in December, 2021. Entitled "", it includes the original "Mary Wilson" LP (available for the first time on compact disc), including a track entitled "Anytime At All", which is an early version of the single "Red Hot". The Anthology boasts a total of thirty eight tracks, highlighting Mary's career from The Primettes, to the Supremes, to a solo artist, to her final single, "Why Can't We All Get Along".

Student Global AIDS Campaign

The Student Global AIDS Campaign (SGAC) is an advocacy group with more than 85 chapters at high schools, colleges, and universities across the United States. The group is committed to bringing an end to HIV and AIDS in the U.S. and around the world, and uses a wide variety of tactics to achieve its goals, including education on campuses, letter-writing and calling campaigns to decision-makers, public demonstrations, media work, and other activist tactics.
The organization often describes its mission in the shorthand 'Fund the Fight, Treat the People, Drop the Debt, Stop the Spread'. The fuller vision statement is: "We envision a world in which AIDS is no longer a death sentence, in which economics and geography do not determine access to life-saving drugs, and where every woman, man, and child has the knowledge, means, and rights to protect her- or himself from infection." The campaign has therefore pushed for access to antiretroviral drugs, the elimination of third world debt, reform of global trade rules, and access to condoms.
History &amp; founding.
In February 2001, the Student Global AIDS Campaign and its parent organization, Global Justice, were founded simultaneously by students at Harvard University and Harvard Kennedy School who saw the untapped potential of students to advocate political and social change on global HIV and AIDS and other issues of global justice. Global Justice became officially incorporated as a 501 (c)(3) organization, with the Student Global AIDS Campaign as its first campaign.
The first conference was a New England regional conference hosted by Harvard in the fall of 2001. That spring and the next fall regional conferences were also held at Indiana University, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and Williams College. In the spring of 2003, SGAC organized its first national conference (hosted by George Washington University), which was attended by more than 500 students from around the country.
As SGAC’s chapter base has grown so has its capacity for effective advocacy. SGAC’s first large rally was held in Boston in the spring of 2002 to demand that Senator John Kerry (who had declared himself the Senate AIDS leader) significantly increase the amount of funding for the Global Fund in the bill he was then writing.
Structure.
SGAC is a youth- and student-led organization organized into chapters based at high schools or universities. There is a national Steering Committee (SC) of students from across the country. Elected by SGAC members for one-year terms, SC members deal with the day-to-day operation of the campaign and fill roles ranging from media coordination to outreach work. Decisions are made by consensus.
Global Justice.
The Student Global AIDS Campaign's original parent organization, Global Justice, was also home to other student-led campaigns on global trade and child survival. Global Justice also employs the staff that work on the Student Global AIDS Campaign, including a full-time national organizer, a shared executive director, and support/communications staff. Global Justice is governed by a board of directors which has included such activists and intellectuals as Jeffrey Sachs, Paul Farmer, and ACT UP co-founder Eric Sawyer, as well as students from each of the group's campaigns. There is also an emerging alumni group of previous leaders who have now graduated.
Health Global Access Project.

Sampooran

Sampooran (Urdu: سمپورن, literal English translation: "complete/perfect") is the debut album of the Pakistani rock band Mekaal Hasan Band, released on January 8, 2004. Singles from the album included "Rabba", released in 2003 and "Sajan", released in 2004.
Concept.
The tunes on "Sampooran" were written incorporating traditional material from the eastern classical tradition and adapting these with music which was based on the jazz rock fusion explosion of the seventies. It possesses arguably the finest musical arrangements that have ever been experienced in the country, and the compositions really light up the album. The album starts with the lukewarm “Sajan” whose lyrics have been taken from a kaafi written by Shah Hussain. A moderate mix of acoustic guitars and percussion and some sweet flute playing renders this a really good opening track. “Waris Shah” is next, with its Yanni-isque musical intonations and lyrics inspired from texts by Amrita Preetam. The album seems to be getting into a groove, as the vocals start getting tuned up and the music gets more and more passionate. A classically inspired flute arrangement mixed with soft bass drums and Javed Bashir does total justice with the lyrics. The song has probably lingered on a bit and some pieces seem a bit lengthy, but overall it is the vocals that stand out on “Waris Shah” more than anything else.
“Rabba” is one of the best songs on the album. A Pink Floyd like opening and again, lyrics taken from a Shah Hussain kafi are enough on their own to guarantee a fine number, but that is not all this track is about. This is also the only track on which a Bass touch has been given, and a video for “Rabba” has been included on the CD.
“Sanwal” is the part of the album where it is beginning to reach its crescendo and the music is getting more and more intense yet it still sounds brilliant. Mekaal Hassan Band had earlier released this song as a single with Ustaad Riaz Ali Khan leading the vocals to a brilliantly composed number. The lyrics are taken from the poetry of Farhat Abbas Shah. The cunningly conceived rises and falls of this song render it a very intense and captivating melody, and this is also the first track of the album which has Urdu lyrics.
The title track “Sampooran” is more of an instrumental number and features a vast array of creative genius at the mercy of a group of people ready to explore its outer horizons. As the name suggests, it is classically inspired and carries on the momentum built by “Rabba” and “Sanwal”.
“Darbari” is where the band reaches the summit in the album and it sounds absolutely superb. Fabulous musical arrangements and a massive performance by Javed Bashir make this the absolute best track on the album. It captivates you and forces you into a feeling of being in a Mughal Darbaar. The lyrics are in Persian. Yet the intensity is so great that you can't help but go into a trance.
“Ya Ali” is almost like an anti climax after 3 absolutely stunning tracks. It is softer in composition, lighter on instruments, although it has the best guitar arrangement on the album and the tune is associated more with Ustaad Salamat Ali Khan, who as Mekaal admits, inspired this song. The last track on the album is Late Moon, a solo which features lengthy flute and percussion sessions.

Alfred Gottschalk (biochemist)

Alfred Gottschalk (22 April 1894 – 4 October 1973) was a German biochemist who was a leading authority in glycoprotein research. During his career he wrote 216 research papers and reviews, and four 
books.
Gottschalk was born in Aachen, the third of four children to Benjamin and Rosa Gottschalk, who had Jewish heritage. He was raised Catholic. He choose to study medicine, from 1912 he attended the Universities of Munich, Freiburg im Breisgau and Bonn. During the war he served in the medical corps of the German Army. He completed his medical degree in 1920, graduating MD from the University of Bonn. He completed clinical work experience at the medical schools of Frankfurt am Main and Würzburg and physiology-biochemistry studies at Bonn, that led to his first publications, an award from the University of Madrid and an invitation to work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Experimental Therapy and Biochemistry with Carl Neuberg.
In 1923 he married Lisbeth Berta Orgler; together they had one son. They separated in 1950. Gottschalk left the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biochemistry in 1926 to become Director of the Biochemical Department at the General Hospital in Stettin. He left the hospital in 1934 following upheaval in Nazi Germany and entered private practice, left for England in the spring of 1939, and on to Melbourne in July. He was offered a position as a biochemist by Charles Kellaway, director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI). He initially worked with yeast enzymes and fermentation, but in 1947 he joined the virus department, where he worked with Frank Macfarlane Burnet. He also taught biochemistry and organic chemistry at the Melbourne Technical College and later at the University of Melbourne. In 1945 he became a naturalized British citizen. In 1949 he received a DSc from the University of Melbourne.
He was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1954. He discovered viral neuraminidase there in 1957. As Burnet stated: “In the world of biochemistry the most important contribution of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute is regarded as Gottschalk’s discovery of the structure of the sialic acids and his recognition that an enzyme which I had characterised biologically was chemically a neuraminidase. Gottschalk’s work was masterly and it was definitive.”
On his retirement in 1959, he was invited by his friend and former WEHI colleague Frank Fenner to research at the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australian National University. He returned to West Germany in 1963, where he was appointed Guest-Professor at the Max Planck Institute for Virus Research in Tübingen. He continued active research and for his contributions to science was elected to the Fellowship of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1967 and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Münster (MD) in 1969.
He died in Tübingen on 4 October 1973. The Gottschalk Medal for medical research awarded by the Australian Academy of Science is named in his honour.

Alan Sullivan

Edward Alan Sullivan (November 29, 1868 — August 6, 1947) was a Canadian poet and author of short stories. He is noted for his 1935 historical adventure novel "The Great Divide", which depicts the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.
History.
Born in St. George's Rectory, Montreal, he was the oldest son of Edward Sullivan and Frances Mary Renaud. In 1869, his father became rector of Trinity Church, Chicago. The family lived to the city in 1871, and thus witnessed the Great Chicago Fire. When he was 15, he began attending Loretto in Musselburgh, Scotland, a famous school for boys.
On his return to Canada, he attended the School of Practical Science, Toronto. After this he did railway exploration work in the West, and later worked in mining. He was assistant engineer in the Clergue enterprises at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario for a year and a half, before the organization of the Consolidated Lake Superior Company. Subsequently, he spent several years as a mining engineer in the Lake of the Woods district during the period of its gold exploitation.
Writing.
He gained recognition in the United States through his poems, short stories and comprehensive articles on various themes. These frequently appeared in "Harper's Magazine", the "Atlantic Monthly", and other leading American periodicals. In 1941 he won the Governor General's Award for English-language fiction for the novel "Three Came to Ville Marie". "Wonder Stories" reviewed his lost race novel "In the Beginning" favorably, saying its depiction of an encounter between modern men and Pleistocene-era tribesmen was a "most tremendous drama of inter-racial conflict".

Singlish vocabulary

Singlish is the English-based creole or patois spoken colloquially in Singapore. English is one of Singapore's official languages, along with Malay (which is also the National Language), Mandarin, and Tamil. Although English is the lexifier language, Singlish has its unique slang and syntax, which are more pronounced in informal speech. It is usually a mixture of English, Hokkien, Cantonese, Malay, and Tamil, and sometimes other Chinese languages like Teochew, Hainanese, Hakka, Hockchew, and Mandarin. For example, means to be annoyed or frustrated, and originates from Singaporean Hokkien 迫促 (POJ: pek-chhek). It is used in casual contexts between Singaporeans, but is avoided in formal events when certain Singlish phrases may be considered unedifying. Singapore English can be broken into two subcategories: Standard Singapore English (SSE) and Colloquial Singapore English (CSE) or Singlish as many locals call it. The relationship between SSE and Singlish is viewed as a diglossia, in which SSE is restricted to be used in situations of formality where Singlish/CSE is used in most other circumstances.
Some of the most popular Singlish terms have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) since 2000, including "wah", "sabo", "lepak", "shiok" and "hawker centre". On 11 February 2015, "kiasu" was chosen as OED's Word of the Day.
Word origins.
Singlish vocabulary formally takes after British English (in terms of spelling and abbreviations), although naming conventions are in a mix of American and British ones (with American ones on the rise). For instance, local media have " (' in British English) and " (soccer—originally slang for "association football"—while used in Britain, is more usually called just '). Singlish also uses many words borrowed from Hokkien, the non-Mandarin Chinese language native to more than 75% of the Chinese in Singapore, and from Malay. In many cases, English words take on the meaning of their Chinese counterparts, resulting in a shift in meaning. Vocabulary is also taken from Indian words such as meaning 'hey', meaning 'fat', etc. This is most obvious in such cases as /, which are functionally equivalent in Singlish and mapped to the same Chinese word, (Hokkien , Cantonese , Mandarin ), which can mean to lend or to borrow. For example: "" / "Hey, can you lend me your calculator?"
Singlish dictionaries and word lists.
There have been several efforts to compile lexicons of Singlish, some for scholarly purposes, but most for entertainment. Two early humorous works were Sylvia Toh Paik Choo's "Eh, Goondu!" (1982) and "Lagi Goondu!" (1986). In 1997 the second edition of the "Times-Chambers Essential English Dictionary" was published. To date, this is the only formally-published English dictionary also containing a substantial number of Singaporean English terms. Such entries and sub-entries are arranged alphabetically amongst the standard English entries. A list of common words borrowed from local languages such as Hokkien and Malay appears in an appendix. It appears that no subsequent editions have been published.
2002 saw the publication of the "Coxford Singlish Dictionary", a light-hearted lexicon which was developed from material posted on the website Talkingcock.com. In 2004, the website "A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English", was launched to document the actual usage of Singlish and Singapore English in published material, in the way that the Oxford English Dictionary does for standard English. Compiled by Jack Lee, an amateur lexicographer, the "Dictionary" was one of the first dictionaries to deal exclusively with Singlish and Singapore English in a professional or academic voice.
In 2024, a much more modern and updated web project was launched by Daniel Goh, another amateur lexicographer. Known as the "Chimbridge Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English", it is (among other features) also the first to contain fully-researched etymologies of all its terms. While it is also written in a professional and academic style, the dictionary documents usage in not just published material, but also casual contexts such as online forums. It is, to date, the most complete and comprehensive dictionary of Singlish terms ever compiled, with up to several thousands more entries than its predecessors.
The Singapore Tourism Board and tourism-related businesses have also produced short lists of commonly used Singlish terms, ostensibly to allow foreigners visiting Singapore to comprehend the local language better. Such lists have been printed in brochures or booklets, and also published on websites.
The lack of an officially printed version of a Singlish dictionary is due to the fact that the Singapore government frowns upon the use of Singlish, their official stance being that the speaking of Singlish will make Singaporeans difficult to understand when communicating with foreigners who are not familiar with Singlish. Thus, the government has made an effort to quash the use of Singlish and to promote the use of standard English through the Speak Good English Movement over the past few years. Though failing to discourage the use of Singlish, it has resulted in Singlish having a bad reputation in recent years, further stalling efforts to document actual Singlish usage.
Letters contributed to the forum of "The Straits Times", the main local newspaper, by readers have called for Singlish to be kept alive in Singapore. Community efforts to do so include the aptly named "Speak Good Singlish Movement". The idea of promoting Singlish was raised as part of a larger debate on creating a uniquely Singaporean identity. However, the government has yet to officially change its stand regarding Singlish.
A list of Singlish terms and expressions widely used in Singapore is set out below. It is not exhaustive nor fully accurate, and is meant to provide some representative examples of Singlish usage in Singapore. The origins of the Singlish terms are indicated where possible, and literal translations are provided where necessary. More comprehensive and accurate information may be found in the various dictionaries and compilations previously mentioned above.
Phonological sounds used in Singlish.
Below are the phonological sounds used from the International Phonetic Alphabet used in Singlish.
List of Singlish words.
Food and beverages.
Singlish is prominently used in local coffee shops, or "kopitiams" (the word is obtained by combining the Malay word for coffee and the Hokkien word for 'shop'), and other eateries. Local names of many food and drink items have become Singlish and consist of words from different languages and are indicative of the multi-racial society in Singapore. For example, "teh" is the Malay word for 'tea' which itself originated from Hokkien, "peng" is the Hokkien word for 'ice', "kosong" is the Malay word for 'zero' to indicate no sugar, and "C" refers to 'Carnation', a brand of evaporated milk.
Food.
Names of common local dishes in Singapore hawker centres are usually referred to in local dialect or language. However, as there are no English words for certain food items, the dialect terms used for them have slowly evolved into part of the Singlish vocabulary. Ordering in Singlish is widely understood by the hawkers. Some examples of food items which have become part of Singlish:
Beverages.
Types of coffee.
These terms can be combined together. For example, strong iced coffee with evaporated milk and sugar would be called “kopi-c gau peng.”
Other beverages.
The above list is not complete; for example, one can add the "-peng" suffix (meaning "iced") to form other variations such as "Teh-C-peng" (tea with evaporated milk and ice) which is a popular drink considering Singapore's warm weather.

David Teece

David John Teece (born September 2, 1948) is a New Zealand-born US-based organizational economist, Professor emeritus in Global Business and director of the Tusher Center for the Management of Intellectual Capital at the Walter A. Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and as of 2024, Distinguished Scholar of Strategy and Innovation at the University of South Florida Muma College of Business.
Teece is the executive chairman and cofounder of Berkeley Research Group, an expert services and consulting firm headquartered in Emeryville, California. His areas of interest include corporate strategy, entrepreneurship, innovation, competition policy, and intellectual property. He is also founding general partner of a venture capital firm, Pilatus Capital.
Biography.
Teece grew up in Blenheim and Nelson, New Zealand and attended Waimea College before enrolling in 1967 at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch (now the site of the Christchurch Arts Centre), where he earned a bachelor's degree and a Master of Commerce degree.
He moved to the United States to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, from which he received a Ph.D. in economics, specializing in industrial economics, international trade, and technological innovation. Two members of the Economics faculty had a particular influence on his research that he later acknowledged in articles he wrote in tribute to each of them: Edwin Mansfield, a pioneer in the study of industrial R&amp;D and the economics of technological change; and Oliver Williamson, Nobel Laureate and creator of Transaction Cost Economics.
Teece taught at Stanford Graduate School of Business from 1975 until 1982, when he was hired by the Haas School of Business at U.C. Berkeley, where he is a chaired professor. He has published more than 200 academic articles and more than a dozen books, and Google Scholar notes that he has been cited at least 170,000 times. He co-founded and serves on the editorial board of two academic journals: Industrial &amp; Corporate Change (Oxford University Press) and the Russian Management Journal. He is also the Executive Director of Berkeley Policy Institute, a nonprofit research organization.
After the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the couple offered a substantial donation to the city for earthquake recovery. The money was used by his former university to install the classics and music school in the Old Chemistry building at the Christchurch Arts Centre. In 2017, 40 years after its move from the Christchurch Central City to the Ilam campus, the University of Canterbury returned to its original home, and opened The Teece Museum of Classical Antiques in May 2017. The Townsend Teece restored telescope has been restored for placement in the university's observatory in Christchurch.
Teece resides in Florida.
Research areas.
Capturing value from innovation.
"Teece has made lasting contributions to the study of innovation." Teece's 1986 paper "Profiting from Technological Innovation" was selected by the editors as one of the best papers published in "Research Policy" from 1971 to 1991 and is the most cited paper ever published in the publication. In October 2006, "Research Policy" published a special issue commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the original article. The paper was updated in 2018 to give attention to emerging issues in the digital economy.
In this series of papers, Teece explained why innovative firms often fail to capture economic returns from their invention. He described how it is sometimes more important for a business to be able to win at marketing, distribution, manufacturing, and other complementary areas than to come up with a big idea in the first place. He identified the factors which determine whether the firm that wins from innovation is the firm that is first to market, a follower firm, or a firm that has related capabilities that the innovation requires to provide value to a customer. The key elements in what has been called the Teece Model are the imitability of the innovation (how easily competitors can copy it) and the ownership of complementary assets. Sidney Winter has argued that Teece's paper contributes "en passant but fundamentally, to the clarification of basic questions."
Dynamic capabilities.
Teece is identified as being partially responsible for the dynamic capabilities perspective in strategic management. Dynamic capabilities have been defined as "the ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address rapidly changing environments". Further, "The concept of dynamic capabilities, especially in terms of organizational knowledge processes, has become the predominant paradigm for the explanation of competitive advantages. However, major unsolved—or at least insufficiently solved—problems are first their measurement and second their management…"
According to "ScienceWatch", his paper (with Gary Pisano and Amy Shuen) "Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management" was the most cited paper in economics and business globally for the period from 1995 to 2005.
Teece's concept of dynamic capabilities is a theory about the foundations of competitive advantage: "the capacity (1) to sense and shape opportunities and threats, (2) to seize opportunities, and (3) to maintain competitiveness through enhancing, combining, protecting, and, when necessary, reconfiguring the business enterprise's intangible and tangible assets."
His concept stands parallel to the dynamic capability perspective of Eisenhardt &amp; Martin (2000). It also builds on the idea of combinatorial capabilities (Kogut &amp; Zander 1992).
Theory of the multiproduct firm.
Roberts and Saloner (2013) credit Teece with "the first attempt to build a systematic theory of the firm scope based on profit-maximizing behavior" (827) in his 1982 article "Towards an Economic Theory of the Multiproduct Firm," in which Teece describes the existence of excess resources in firms, stating that firms could better use those resources by diversifying into new lines of business. He also presents transaction cost arguments regarding whether resources can be shared contractually, and explains that protecting those resources is a potential basis for diversification. Teece additionally builds on Williamson (1975) in arguing that "internal capital allocation may be better than what the market can achieve" (828).
Dynamic Competition.
For over three decades Teece has criticized antitrust and competition economics for its failure to consider the power of innovation driven broad spectrum dynamic competition. Teece tweaks the sources of economic rents down more finely, and believes Schumpeterian and Ricardian rents are generally benign from an antitrust perspective. This is seen to be "a very valuable insight" that is counter to traditional antitrust enforcement. He is recognized for persistently alerting regulatory bodies to the different nature of competition in the innovation economy compared to the industrial economy.
Panmure House Declaration.
Teece invited and organized the "New Enlightenment Conference" in Panmure House, the original home of Adam Smith in Edinburgh, Scotland, July 2019. The conference participants signed the Panmure House Declaration, "the first major pronouncement from Adam Smith's home since 1790." It called for a stronger commitment to Adam Smith's values of economic freedom and a rule-of-law democracy, and the pursuit of the common good. Teece became the inaugural Adam Smith scholar in residence in Panmure House.
Honors.
Teece holds eight honorary doctorates: Saint Petersburg State University (Russia, 2000), where he was honored for his role in co-founding the business school; Copenhagen Business School (Denmark, 2004); Lappeenranta University of Technology (Finland, 2004); University of Canterbury (New Zealand, 2007);University of Calgary (Canada, 2015); Kaunas University of Technology (Lithuania, 2016); European Business School (Germany, 2016); and Edinburgh Business School (United Kingdom, 2017). He is also an honorary professor at China's Zhongnan University of Economics and Law and King Saud University in Saudi Arabia and an Honorary Member of the Law and Economics Association of New Zealand.
In 2002, Accenture listed Teece among its Top 50 Business Intellectuals. The ranking system was based on a combination of Google name hits, LexisNexis media database searches, and citations found in the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index.
In 2003, Lappeenranta University presented Teece with the first Viipuri International Prize in Strategic (Technology) Management and Business Economics.
A 2008 analysis by Thomson Scientific found him to be one of the top-10 most-cited scholars in economics and business from 1997 to 2007.
In 2011 he received the Herbert Simon award from Laszlo College for Advanced Studies, Corvinus University of Budapest.
A 2011 article, "Innovation in Multi-Invention Contexts," coauthored with Deepak Somaya and Simon Wakeman, was selected as the winner of the 2012 "California Management Review" Best Article Award. This article presents a framework designed to help guide managers of innovating firms in designing appropriate strategy when seeking to bring an innovation to market in a multi-invention context.
In the 2013 New Year Honours, Teece was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to New Zealand–United States relations. He also received the Academy of International Business Eminent Scholar Award in Istanbul in July 2013. Teece is described as a "'leading authority' on matters related to antitrust and competition policy and intellectual property stating and is 'highly sought after.'"
Who Who's Legal 2018 noted that David Teece is "'extremely highly regarded' for his longstanding output in the field of competition economics." In the same year, the Strategic Management Society awarded him the CK Prahalad Distinguished Scholar-Practitioner Award and classified him as "a renowned academic, a prolific author, an active consultant, serial entrepreneur, angel investor and CEO mentor."
In 2020 he was ranked as the world's most-cited scholar in the combined field of business and management in an analysis of science-wide author citations published in PLOS Biology, a peer-reviewed journal. He was also indicted into the Thinkers50 Hall of Fame.
In 2022, Teece was elected an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand.
Political views.
Teece has not publicly stated his political views, though he chaired Californians for a Balanced Budget and Better Economy, a PAC that supported Tom Campbell's 2012 run for U.S. Senate.
His largest political donation was $500,000 to Californians for a Balanced Budget and Better Economy. In recent election cycles he has donated to several Republican senators' campaigns, including Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Tom Cotton, Lisa Murkowski, and Dan Sullivan.
Selected publications.

Bornean crested fireback

The Bornean crested fireback (Lophura ignita) is a medium-sized forest pheasant from Borneo and the Bangka Belitung Islands. It is the type species of the genus "Lophura". Prior to 2023, it was referred to as simply the crested fireback as the Malayan crested fireback ("L. rufa") was lumped with this species, though both have since been split.
Males are up to 70 cm long with a peacock-like dark crest, bluish black plumage, reddish brown rump, black outer tail feathers, red iris and bare blue facial skin. The female is a brown bird with short crest, blue facial skin and spotted black-and-white below.
There are two subspecies; the subspecies from Borneo and Bangka Island, "L. i. ignita" (lesser Bornean crested fireback) and "L. i. nobilis" (greater Bornean crested fireback), have brown central tail feathers, whitish legs and are rufous below. Prior to 2014, the Malayan crested fireback was lumped with this species as a subspecies by BirdLife International, while the International Ornithological Congress split both species in 2023 based on substantial plumage differences. The female of "L. i ignita" and "L. i. nobilis" have a dark, blackish tail and whitish legs, while female of "L. i.a rufa" has a chestnut brown tail and red legs. Delacour's crested fireback ("L. i." "macartneyi") was formerly also considered a subspecies, but as specimens are variable, the Handbook of Birds of the World regards it as a hybrid swarm between "rufa" and a possible relictual or introduced population of "ignita". In 2023 the IOC lumped "macartneyi" with "rufa" for this reason.
The diet consists mainly of plants, fruits and small animals. The female usually lays between four and eight creamy white eggs.
Due to ongoing habitat loss and overhunting in some areas, the crested fireback is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Beira (antelope)

The beira (Dorcatragus megalotis) is a small arid adapted antelope that inhabits arid regions of the Horn of Africa. It is the only member of the genus Dorcatragus.
Description.
The beira has a bushy tail and a coarse coat which is reddish grey on the back separated from the white underparts by a dark band which extends along each side from the elbow to the rear leg. Its long, slender legs are fawn-coloured and the head is yellowish red with black eyelids and white eye rings. The beira has disproportionately large ears, which are long and across with white fur on their interiors. Only the males have horns which are long, straight spikes which grow out vertically from near the sides of the ears. The length of the animal is , it stands at the shoulder and weighs between .
Distribution.
The beira is endemic to northeast Africa, it occurs in the far south of Djibouti southwards across Somaliland and northern Somalia, and into extreme northeastern Ethiopia. The main part of its range is in Somaliland, from the frontier with Djibouti, east into Puntland in northern Somalia and the Nogaal Valley. Its occurrence in Djibouti was confirmed in only 1993.
Habitat.
Beira are found in rocky or stony hillsides and slopes, among dry, grassland interspersed with acacia scrub and many sites are on hills with flat summits and steep stony sides.
Habits.
Beira have only been recorded giving birth in April at the height of the rainy season. Gestation lasts six months and one calf is born. They are most active in the early morning and late afternoon, and rest in the middle of the day. They are extremely wary, and are alerted to the slightest disturbance by their excellent hearing, moving off with great speed across the scree on the rocky slopes, bounding with agility from rock to rock on steeper, less broken terrain. Beira are adapted to arid climate and do not need to find water, as they obtain all they need from the plants they browse. Beira live in small family groups and pairs, always with a single male, but larger groups have been recorded and these probably occur when family groups meet up. Beira are predominantly browsers, but also graze when grass is available. Hyenas, caracals and jackals are the main predators of beira, and where they occur lions and leopards will take them too.
Conservation.
The beira is subject to some low level hunting but its small size, extreme wariness, and the inaccessible rocky habitat may allow it to withstand hunting pressure. Overgrazing, drought and cutting of acacia scrub for charcoal production are thought to be greater threats. It is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. In Djibouti it is thought to be rare but not endangered. and its status in Ethiopia is currently unknown, the last record being in 1972.
The only captive breeding group of beira was at Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation where they have been successfully bred and the number reached a peak of 58 in 2005.
Name.
The term 'beira' is derived from its Somali name.

Jacoby Ellsbury

Jacoby McCabe Ellsbury ( ; born September 11, 1983) is an American former professional baseball center fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox from 2007 through 2013 and then played for the New York Yankees from 2014 to 2017. An enrolled member of the Colorado River Indian Tribes, Ellsbury is the first Native American of Navajo descent to play Major League Baseball.
Ellsbury was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 23rd round of the 2002 MLB draft, but did not sign. After having played college baseball for three years at Oregon State University, he was selected in the 1st round by the Red Sox, as the 23rd overall pick in the 2005 draft. He made his major league debut for the Red Sox in 2007. In 2011, Ellsbury was named American League Comeback Player of the Year, was named to the American League All-Star team, won a Gold Glove and a Silver Slugger Award, became the first Red Sox player in history to be a member of the 30–30 club, and was the runner-up to Justin Verlander for the American League Most Valuable Player Award. He led the American League in stolen bases three times (in 2008, 2009, and 2013) and won World Series championships as a member of the Red Sox in 2007 and 2013.
After the 2013 season, Ellsbury signed a seven-year, $153 million contract with the Yankees. He played for the Yankees from 2014 to 2017, but was unable to play in 2018 or 2019 due to injury. Ellsbury was released by the Yankees on November 20, 2019. He ended his playing days as the single season and career record holder for reaching base via catcher's interference.
Early life.
Ellsbury was born on September 11, 1983, to Jim and Margie Ellsbury. He is the eldest of four children. The Ellsburys lived on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation until they moved to Madras, Oregon, when Jacoby was in kindergarten. He was raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Ellsbury is an enrolled member of the Colorado River Indian Tribes. Margie Ellsbury is a full-blooded Navajo and a descendant of 19th-century tribal leader Ganado Mucho. Her father, Franklin McCabe, was a silversmith, and her mother was a traditional rug weaver. Jim Ellsbury is of English and German descent.
In Little League, Ellsbury often played with teammates up to three years older than him. At Madras High School, he lettered in five sports. In his senior year in baseball, he hit .537 with 65 stolen bases. In basketball, he averaged 23.6 points and 4.4 blocks per game. He finished his football career with nine interceptions and six kickoff returns for touchdowns. He went to Oregon State University where he was a Baseball America first-team All-American and Pac-10 Conference Co-Player of the year, with Trevor Crowe. In 2002, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Bend Elks of the West Coast League. In 2004, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was drafted in the first round of the 2005 MLB draft by the Boston Red Sox as a compensation pick from the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for the signing of Orlando Cabrera.
Professional career.
Minor leagues.
Ellsbury began his professional career on July 14, 2005, with the Lowell Spinners in the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League. On September 7, he tied a Lowell team record with three stolen bases in a single game. For the 2005 season, he batted .317 with 23 stolen bases in 35 games.
Ellsbury began the 2006 season ranked by "Baseball America" as the sixth-best prospect in the Red Sox' organization. He started the season with the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. On July 3, he tied a Wilmington franchise record by stealing four bases in a game. After batting .299 with 25 steals in 61 games and being named to the 2006 Carolina League All-Star team, Ellsbury was promoted to the Portland Sea Dogs of the Class AA Eastern League on July 12, 2006. Soon after his promotion to Portland, Ellsbury was named Eastern League Player of the Week for August 6–13. Ellsbury finished the season in Portland with .308 batting average and 16 steals in 50 games. The Red Sox selected him as their Minor League Defensive Player of the Year and Baserunner of the Year. The team assigned him to the Peoria Javelinas of the Arizona Fall League (AFL), an off-season developmental league for top prospects. In the AFL, Ellsbury hit .276 in 25 games. His defensive skills earned him a spot in the AFL Rising Stars All-Star game.
Ellsbury participated in the Red Sox' 2007 spring training camp in Fort Myers, Florida, as a non-roster invitee and was assigned to the minor league camp on March 9. He was rated the best prospect in the Red Sox' organization and the 33rd-best prospect in baseball for 2007 by "Baseball America", while "Sports Illustrated" ranked Ellsbury as the 43rd-best prospect in baseball. Ellsbury began the 2007 season as the starting center fielder for the Sea Dogs and was promoted to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Class AAA International League on May 4 after batting .452 in 17 games at Portland and being named the Eastern League Player of the Month for April. He was chosen to play in the 2007 All-Star Futures Game as part of the MLB All-Star festivities at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco. On August 24, Ellsbury set a new consecutive-game hitting streak record for Pawtucket with 25, besting the consecutive-game mark of 19 previously shared by Dave Stapleton and Dave Berg.
Ellsbury finished the season with 33 stolen bases for Pawtucket, which tied him for second in the International League. For the second consecutive season, the Red Sox selected him as their minor league Defensive Player of the Year and Baserunner of the Year.
Boston Red Sox.
2007.
The 2007 Baseball America Prospect Handbook compared Ellsbury to former Red Sox center fielder Johnny Damon, lauding his speed, hitting and fielding while noting his below-average throwing arm. After Coco Crisp was injured, the Red Sox purchased Ellsbury's contract and he received a call-up on June 30, in which he made his MLB debut in center field and hit ninth against the Texas Rangers at Fenway Park wearing number 46. Ellsbury is the first American Indian of Navajo descent to reach the major leagues. He recorded his first major league hit, an infield single off Robinson Tejeda, in the bottom of the third inning of that game. Ellsbury's first career stolen base came off pitcher Brandon McCarthy and catcher Gerald Laird of the Rangers on July 2. He also scored from second base in that game on a wild pitch. Johnny Pesky described the play as "the greatest single play I've ever seen in all my years in baseball". Ellsbury was optioned back to Pawtucket on July 5 after playing six games for the Red Sox.
On August 17, the Red Sox recalled Ellsbury from Pawtucket for the second game of a doubleheader, in which he led off and played center field. He was optioned back to Pawtucket after the game. When major league rosters expanded to 40 players on September 1, he was a September call-up by the Red Sox. On September 2, he hit his first major league home run, a solo shot which landed in the Red Sox bullpen, in the bottom of the fourth inning off Daniel Cabrera of the Baltimore Orioles. A September 2007 article in "The New York Times" described him as a "cult hero" who brings "speed, improved defense, and unbridled enthusiasm." Ellsbury was named MLB's American League Rookie of the Month for September 2007. With fewer than 130 major league at-bats, he still qualified as a rookie for the 2008 season.
During the 2007 postseason, with Crisp struggling, Ellsbury started in center field for Game 6 of the 2007 American League Championship Series (ALCS) against the Cleveland Indians, and started the remainder of the postseason for the Red Sox. In 11 postseason games, he hit .360 in 25 at-bats with two stolen bases. With his two doubles off Josh Fogg in the top of the third inning of Game 3 of the 2007 World Series on October 27, Ellsbury became the first rookie to hit two doubles in the same inning of a World Series game. After hitting another double, off Brian Fuentes in the eighth inning, he became the fourth rookie ever to hit three doubles in a World Series game. Ellsbury's four hits, including a single in the first inning, made him only the third rookie to ever accomplish the feat in the World Series, after Freddie Lindstrom in the 1924 World Series and Joe Garagiola in the 1946 World Series. He batted .438 with four doubles and a stolen base for the World Series. The Red Sox eventually won the World Series in a four-game sweep over the Rockies, giving Ellsbury his first career championship title.
2008.
Heading into the 2008 season, Ellsbury was ranked the 13th-best prospect in baseball by "Baseball America", the 16th-best prospect by "Baseball Prospectus", and the 19th-best prospect by "ESPN Scouts Inc". Ellsbury hit .224, with .291 on-base percentage (OBP), and a .347 slugging percentage in 16 spring training games and started in center field on Opening Day of the 2008 Major League Baseball season against the Oakland Athletics on March 25 at the Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, Japan. Ellsbury had his first career multi-home run game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on April 22. Ellsbury stole 25 consecutive bases without being caught, until he was caught stealing in a game on May 18. He was two stolen bases shy of the major league record held by Tim Raines in 1979. With three stolen bases against the Baltimore Orioles on May 30, he became the first Red Sox player to steal more than two bases in a game since Jerry Remy stole four in 1980. Ellsbury stole his 32nd base of the season on June 15, breaking the Red Sox' rookie record, set 100 years earlier by Amby McConnell. He finished the season with 50 steals to lead the American League, putting him third on the list of Red Sox all-time stolen base leaders for a single season, behind Tommy Harper (54) in 1973 and Tris Speaker (52) in 1912. Ellsbury finished third in the AL Rookie of the Year voting, behind Evan Longoria of Tampa Bay and Alexei Ramírez of the Chicago White Sox.
Ellsbury hit .333, with a .400 OBP and a .567 slugging percentage, and three stolen bases in the 2008 American League Division Series (ALDS), in which the Red Sox defeated the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, 3–1, in the best-of-five series. In the second inning of Game 3 of the ALDS, he hit the first three-run single in postseason history when Howie Kendrick and Torii Hunter let a pop-up fall to the ground between them. After going 0–for-14 in the first three games of the 2008 ALCS against the Tampa Bay Rays, Ellsbury was benched in favor of Crisp with only a pinch hitting at-bat in game 4. He did not play in the final three games of the series, and the Sox eventually lost the series 4–3.
In 2008, Ellsbury was one of three active non-Hispanic Native American players in Major League Baseball, along with Kyle Lohse and Joba Chamberlain.
2009.
Ellsbury played his 179th straight regular-season game without an error on April 12, 2009, breaking the franchise record for outfielders held by Mike Greenwell. On April 15, with six errorless chances, Ellsbury passed Coco Crisp for most errorless total chances by a center fielder, setting a new Red Sox franchise record of 433. Ellsbury tied a major league record for outfielders with 12 putouts in a nine-inning game on May 20, tying Earl Clark of the Boston Braves, who accomplished the feat in 1929, and Lyman Bostock of the Minnesota Twins, who did it in 1977. Ellsbury's streak of errorless games ended at 232, with 554 errorless chances, when he committed an error on June 17.
Ellsbury tied Tommy Harper's franchise single season record for stolen bases (54) on August 21. Ellsbury then broke the record with his 55th steal on August 25, against the Chicago White Sox. He finished the season with 70 stolen bases, the most in the American League, and he also led the league in triples with 10. He won Defensive Player of the Year in MLB.com's annual This Year in Baseball Awards 2009.
2010.
During the offseason, Ellsbury changed his uniform number from 46 to 2, which had belonged to the Red Sox' former bench coach, Brad Mills, who left the organization to become the manager of the Houston Astros. With the Red Sox signing free agent center fielder Mike Cameron and not re-signing left fielder Jason Bay, Ellsbury became the Red Sox' starting left fielder. The move was made as the result of Cameron's experience in center and inexperience in left. Manager Terry Francona expressed excitement over the prospect of playing a true center fielder in left field, creating a larger fielding range and more aggressive style.
On April 11, Ellsbury collided with Red Sox third baseman Adrián Beltré in a game against the Kansas City Royals, and the collision resulted in hairline fractures to four of his left ribs. He was put on the 15-day disabled list on April 20, and he returned to the Red Sox on May 22. He returned to the 15-day DL on May 28 after playing in only three games due to residual soreness in his ribs from the collision with Beltré. He met with a thoracic specialist who advised him that his ribs should be further along in the healing process before he would be able to play. He started a rehab assignment with Lowell on July 26, and rejoined the Red Sox on August 4. Ellsbury returned to the 15-day disabled list on August 14 after re-injuring his ribs in a game against the Texas Rangers. He did not play again in 2010.
2011.
During games on August 2 and 3, Ellsbury had walk-off hits in the back-to-back games against the Cleveland Indians; a single off Vinnie Pestano and a home run off Joe Smith. On August 6, he hit a three-run home run and drove in a career-high six runs in Boston's 10–4 win over the New York Yankees. On September 25, he hit two home runs during the first game of a doubleheader against the Yankees to become the first member of the Boston Red Sox to join the 30–30 club.
Ellsbury finished the season with career highs in home runs (32), hits (212), RBIs (105), runs (119), and batting average (.321). He also led the American League in power-speed number (35.2), total bases (364), and extra-base hits (83). He won his first Gold Glove Award, and finished as one of only two qualifying players to complete the season with a 1.000 fielding percentage. Jacoby was awarded a Silver Slugger Award for his hitting, joining teammate Adrián González as the only American League players to win both the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards in 2011. Ellsbury was voted the American League Comeback Player of the Year and finished second in the 2011 American League Most Valuable Player Award balloting with 242 points, losing to Justin Verlander (280).
2012.
On April 13, 2012, while attempting to slide under Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Reid Brignac in an attempt to break up a double play, Ellsbury collided with the shortstop. His right shoulder was injured when Brignac fell on top of his exposed shoulder. He was placed on the disabled list with a subluxation of the shoulder on April 14. He was activated from the DL and returned to the Red Sox lineup on July 13, and finished the season with a .271 batting average, four home runs, 26 RBI, and 14 stolen bases in only 74 games played.
2013.
Ellsbury set a franchise record for most stolen bases in a game with five on May 30.
In the August 28 game against the Orioles, Ellsbury suffered a compression fracture by fouling a ball off his right foot. He was taken to the Steadman Clinic in Vail, Colo., for treatment from Dr. Thomas Clanton, who cleared him to rejoin the Red Sox lineup on September 25, well ahead of the preliminary prognosis.
Ellsbury turned in a strong performance in the 2013 postseason, batting .500 in the 2013 ALDS and .318 in the 2013 ALCS. In the 2013 World Series, Ellsbury started the eventual series-winning rally in Game 6 with a single and earned his second World Series ring as a member of the Red Sox. Ellsbury's contract expired on October 31, 2013, and he became a free agent for the first time in his career.
New York Yankees.
On December 3, 2013, Ellsbury and the New York Yankees agreed in principle to a seven-year, $153 million deal, including an option for an eighth year that could increase the value of the contract to $169 million. The contract became official on December 7.
2014.
On April 22, 2014, Ellsbury played his first game at Fenway Park since leaving the Red Sox to join the Yankees. He received an ovation of boos from Red Sox fans. In his first season with the Yankees, Ellsbury hit .271 with 16 home runs and 39 stolen bases. He remained healthy for most of the season, playing in 149 games, the third-most games he has ever played in one season. Ellsbury's home run count was the second-highest of his career next to his 2011 season. He also led the American League in power-speed number (22.7).
2015.
Ellsbury had a hot start to 2015, batting .363 up to May 7. On May 20, 2015, Ellsbury was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a right knee sprain. Prior to the injury, he compiled a .324 batting average in 148 at-bats. After missing nearly two months, Ellsbury returned on July 8, 2015, and had an extremely rough end to the season. He batted .224 in 74 games after he returned from the disabled list and did not start in the 2015 American League Wild Card Game, losing his job in favor of Chris Young. He ended the underwhelming season hitting .257/.318/.345 with seven home runs and 21 stolen bases in 111 games.
2016.
On April 22, 2016, Ellsbury executed a straight steal of home against Matt Moore of the Tampa Bay Rays during a full count, tying the game at 3. It marked the first time a Yankee successfully stole home since Chris Young did so in 2014 as part of a double steal, and the first straight steal of home since Derek Jeter in 2001. It was Ellsbury's second career steal of home; the first occurred in 2009 against Andy Pettitte and the Yankees. On June 8, Ellsbury hit the highest home run of the MLB season against the Los Angeles Angels, reaching a recorded 151 feet in the air. On July 20, Ellsbury reached base via catcher's interference for the ninth time in the season, setting a new single-season MLB record. The record had previously belonged to Roberto Kelly, who reached base eight times on catcher's interference in 1992. Ellsbury would end the season with 12 catcher's interferences. Ellsbury played in 148 games in 2016. While he remained fully healthy, the 2016 season was another underwhelming one for Ellsbury offensively, as he hit .263/.330/.374 with nine home runs and 20 stolen bases, the latter being his lowest in a healthy season.
2017.
On April 28, 2017, Ellsbury hit his first career grand slam against the Baltimore Orioles in a 14-11 Yankees comeback win. It was also the 100th home run of his career. On May 24, Ellsbury made a superb catch at the center field wall, but also banged his head at the wall, causing him to suffer a concussion. He was placed on the 7-day disabled list the next day. On June 10, Joe Girardi stated that Ellsbury had lost his job as the Yankees' starting center fielder to Aaron Hicks, who would continue to start even when Ellsbury is healthy. Ellsbury was activated from the disabled list on June 26 after missing 29 games, the same day that Hicks was placed on the 10-day disabled list with an oblique injury. With the rise of rookie outfielder Clint Frazier, Ellsbury lost his job again and was relegated to the bench. On his 34th birthday on September 11, Ellsbury reached via catcher's interference for the 30th time in his career, which broke Pete Rose's career record of 29. In 2017, he batted .264/.348/.402 with seven home runs and 22 stolen bases.
2018.
On March 19, 2018, the Yankees announced that Ellsbury would not be ready for Opening Day due to a right oblique strain. On April 3, it was revealed that Ellsbury had been diagnosed with a hip ailment. On August 6, he had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his left hip and was declared to be out for the rest of the 2018 season.
2019.
Ellsbury began the 2019 year on the 10-day injured list due to a foot injury. On April 20, he was transferred to the 60-day injured list. It was revealed that he was dealing with plantar fasciitis and a shoulder injury. On September 8, the Yankees ruled Ellsbury out for the season.
Ellsbury was released by the Yankees on November 20, 2019. The team owed Ellsbury's $21 million 2020 salary, together with a $5 million buyout for the 2021 season. The Yankees planned not to pay Ellsbury the money as they claimed that he received unauthorized medical care. The players association was not pleased about this hearing and filed a grievance. Arbiters sided with Ellsbury and the Yankees paid the remaining owed money on his contract. Following Ellsbury's release, sportswriters described his contract as among the worst in Yankees history.
Personal life.
Ellsbury was raised as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but he and his three brothers stopped attending services when Jacoby was a teenager; as reported in "The Boston Globe" in 2008, Ellsbury said, "I try not to get [God] too involved in baseball. What I wish for is good health."
Ellsbury was one of the victims of the $8 billion fraud perpetrated by wealth manager Allen Stanford; although he had some assets frozen, it did not cause him any significant hardship akin to those suffered by Johnny Damon and Xavier Nady.
Ellsbury and Kelsey Hawkins married in December 2012, and they have four children.
In 2010, Ellsbury released a Zinfandel wine called ZinfandEllsbury through Charity Wines, with 100% of his proceeds donated among three charities: The Navajo Relief Fund, Project Bread: The Walk for Hunger, and Ellsbury Read Project. The wine launched alongside a charity wine by former Boston Red Sox teammate Josh Beckett, called Chardon-K.
In June 2014, Ellsbury donated $1 million to his alma mater Oregon State University as part of a $3 million renovation project at Goss Stadium. The Beavers' new home locker room was named the Jacoby Ellsbury Locker Room in his honor.
