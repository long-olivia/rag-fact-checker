Brody Castle

The Brody Castle () is a former fortress in the city of Brody, part of Lviv Oblast, Ukraine.
History and overview.
The earliest information about the construction of the castle in Brody town refers to the 1580s. Crown Hetman () Stanisław Koniecpolski acquired Brody town in 1629 and built the castle bastion of a new type between 1630 and 1635 under the supervision of Italian architect Andrea del Aqua, based on a design by Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan.
The castle was pentagonal in plan and included five bastions and curtain walls, with octagonal dungeons in the middle. It was surrounded by the deep moat. The total number of casemates in the castle was 75; they were used as barracks and warehouses. The governor lived in a wooden house in the castle grounds. This house, as well as a wooden chapel, remained until the middle of the 18th century.
The castle and the fortress withstood a siege by Cossack troops that lasted several weeks during the Khmelnytsky Uprising in 1648. During the Battle of Berestechko (1651) the fortress was the Polish military base. Here the captive Cossacks were detained.
In the late 1660s the castle was renovated, and thanks to this the locals could hide there during the Turkish campaigns in 1672 and in 1676.
The castle was acquired in 1704 by the Potocki family. Count Potocki reconstructed the castle for his own residence in rococo style. 
In 1772, after the First Partition of Poland, Brody town was withdrawn by Austria.
Russian forces ravaged Brody during the War of the Polish Succession. At the order of the Austrian administration, most of the remaining fortifications were demolished by Wincenty Potocki in 1812: the ravelin, the clock tower, two bastions from the city side; the moat was filled.
In the aftermath of World War II, the castle housed a military unit, and at that time it was badly damaged due to reconstructions. The military unit left the fortress only in the 1990s. After that the palace facilities were transferred to the local school; there is also the regional archive and exhibition halls of the Brody Museum of Local History. The castle dungeons are still in ruins and are not used, that leads to considerable damages. The only surviving structure now is the much rebuilt two-storey palace of Stanislaw Potocki (1753–1805).
It is worth mentioning that there was once a beautiful park in front of the castle. Before the war, the Serwański family played a crucial role in managing and maintaining the park, becoming not only guardians of its natural wealth but also advocates of the idea of harmony between man and nature.

The Mysteries of Pittsburgh (film)

The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is a 2009 comedy-drama film written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, based on Michael Chabon's 1988 novel of the same name. It was produced by Michael London and executive produced by Omar Amanat. Set in 1980s Pittsburgh, the film follows the affairs of two young men with one woman, and later also with each other.
Shooting in Pittsburgh began sometime between January and September 2006 and ended in October 2006. "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" made its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2008, and was released in the US on April 10, 2009 to predominantly negative reviews.
Production.
Earlier attempts to bring "Pittsburgh" to the big screen failed, including Chabon's own attempt to adapt his novel. In early 2000, independent filmmaker Jon Sherman (writer and director of 1996's "Breathing Room") adapted Chabon's novel into a screenplay, hoping to film it with Jason Schwartzman in the role of Art Bechstein. By August of the same year, Chabon announced that the project had fallen apart, sadly writing, "Ah, well. Maybe someday."
Director Rawson Marshall Thurber got hold of the project sometime prior to 2006, when he began filming after convincing Michael Chabon he could make it work. Chabon had seen the script, and was pleased with it. In order to facilitate the film adaptation, Thurber removed the character of Arthur Lecomte "whole cloth" from the original Chabon novel in what he described as "the most glaring change". Lecomte, a gay man for whom Art begins to develop feelings, had to be removed because Thurber felt strongly "that in order for the film to function properly, it needed a more efficient and more cinematic engine — in short, a love triangle." Consequently, many elements of Arthur Lecomte were folded into the character of Cleveland.
Controversy.
Cast member Sienna Miller created a minor stir in Pittsburgh when, in a 2006 interview with "Rolling Stone", she referred to the city as "Shitsburgh", saying, "Can you believe this is my life? Will you pity me when you're back in your funky New York apartment and I'm still in Pittsburgh? I need to get more glamorous films and stop with my indie year." Miller has been parodied in Pittsburgh media (including one article that was headlined "Semi-famous actress dumps on the 'Burgh") and criticized for making what was seen as an unnecessarily disparaging remark, given the special treatment the film's cast and crew had been given by the visitor's bureau and other city offices. Miller soon apologized and said her remarks were taken out of context. She added that she was referring to the night time shooting schedule of the production, and that what she had seen of the city was beautiful.
Reception.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 12% based on 42 reviews with an average score of 3.9/10. The site’s critics consensus reads, "A listless interpretation of Michael Chabon's first novel, "Mysteries of Pittsburgh" features none of the source material's charm, but has coming-of-age film cliches in abundance." On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 38, based on 14 reviews.
CBC News gave the movie and Thurber a damning review. Reviewer Martin Morrow felt Thurber was "out of his depth" with the Chabon novel, and were amazed that "like some act of reverse alchemy, Thurber has taken movie-friendly gold and turned it into dull metal." Morrow added that the film "cuts, combines or perversely twists the book's characters, drops some of the best scenes, skimps on the sex and – unbelievably – substitutes Thurber's leaden writing for Chabon's wit", whereas the original novel was "just as camera-ready" as "Wonder Boys", which had been adapted into a film in 2000. Morrow was also critical of Thurber's "timid" take on Art's sexual revelation, and Foster's acting. He described Cleveland as a "perfect role" for Sarsgaard, and praised Sarsgaard's acting, but felt the character's humour was missing.
"Gay City News" felt that the adaptation compromised the "very literary" debut novel and criticized Foster's "cheap voice-over narration" for failing to add any dimension to what's happening on screen. Reviewer Gary M. Kramer was critical of the film for excising the character of Arthur, compressing the character of Phlox and for bringing supporting characters Jane and Cleveland into the foreground, and was critical of Sarsgaard's acting. The review concluded that the film "seems a victim of poor planning and bad timing" and was very distant from "the excellent source novel."
Dave White of Movies.com noted that the movie "makes the 1137th film in which Peter Sarsgaard is called upon to play a smug, condescending, somewhat unbalanced, louche, bisexual jerk" and suspected the actor might become typecast. White added his disappointment with the self-pitying and mopy qualities of Foster's character, and consequently felt the movie played as if "watching "Felicity" if she were a sexually experimental guy." Despite his grievances, White awarded the film a mildly below average C− rating and commented, "I don't want to bash it too much because it's obviously a labor of love from director Rawson Marshall Thurber (he made "" just to get the cash to free himself to make this)".
Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film two out of four stars, and felt the movie's premise was too similar to many others, such as the 1980s-set coming-of-age film "Adventureland", which was released the week before, and is also set in Pittsburgh. He felt the main character was hard to sympathise with and that the plot was like a "1930s Warner Bros. social melodrama". Ebert was more praising of the acting for the film's supporting cast, but felt that their characters' motivations were left unclear. Sacha Howells of Film.com noted the release of "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" coincided with the release of "The Informers", another Jon Foster film about bisexuals in the 1980s, based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same name. Howells noted that, while reviews for most films have been mixed, "the decision to see "Pittsburgh" on April 10 or "Informers" on April 24 is completely subjective -- do you like your literary adaptations debauched and nihilistic or wistful and bittersweet?", with Howells opining he would probably be seeing both.

Rock Steady (All Saints song)

"Rock Steady" is a song performed by English-Canadian recording girl group All Saints from their third studio album, "Studio 1" (2006). It was co-written by group member Shaznay Lewis in collaboration with the track's producer Greg Kurstin. The song was released by Parlophone on 6 November 2006. All Saints collaborated with Kurstin on a number of songs; six were chosen for the album. "Rock Steady" was released as the first single from it. The song contains prominent 2 tone, dance-pop, reggae fusion, rocksteady and ska musical characteristics. It is lyrically influenced by the personalities of the group members themselves.
"Rock Steady" received mainly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. The song also garnered charting success for All Saints both in the United Kingdom and internationally. It debuted at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart before reaching a peak of number three the following week. It became All Saints' ninth consecutive top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. The single also garnered chart success internationally; peaking within the top 10 in the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary and Spain, and the top 40 in several other countries.
The accompanying music video for "Rock Steady" was directed by W.I.Z. and it was released on 30 September 2006; it features the group acting as professional bank robbers. In order to promote the song, All Saints performed "Rock Steady" live on various television shows, including "Ant &amp; Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway", "Popworld" and "Top of the Pops", and was subsequently performed on their Red Flag Tour (2016) and Testament Tour (2018).
Background, release, and composition.
All Saints announced in January 2006 that the group had officially reformed after splitting in 2001. On 20 September 2006, the group revealed that the title of their 'comeback single' was "Rock Steady" and that it would be released on 6 November, accompanied by two B-sides: "Dope Noize" and "Do Me". The song premiered on BBC Radio 1's "The Chris Moyles Show" on 21 September 2006. In Australia, a CD single was issued on 15 January 2007.
The song was produced by Greg Kurstin. Kurstin also performed all instrumentation involved in the song and, recorded and mixed the song at Mayfair Studios in London, England. John Hudson was Kurstin's recording assistant for the track and Jasper Irm, Simon Hayes and Toshi Minesaki were involved in its engineering. All backing vocals in the song are sung by group members Nicole Appleton and Natalie Appleton. "Rock Steady" was mastered by Geoff Pesche.
The song is composed in the key of D minor, the beat is set in common time and moves at 136 beats per minute. "Rock Steady" features a different and new style in music in comparison to previous All Saints tracks. It is upbeat song which contains prominent elements of 2 tone, dance-pop, reggae fusion, rocksteady and ska music, and was described by the "Huddersfield Daily Examiner" as having "sassy reggae pop" musical characteristics. The song is constructed in verse-chorus form. The first verse is sung by Lewis and the second verse is sung by Nicole. Melanie Blatt leads the song's middle eight along with Natalie. All the verses are sung in call and response with the chorus being sung as a combined vocal by all group members with Lewis on lead.
Controversy.
Surrounding the release of "Rock Steady" was controversy regarding its sound after Cheryl from rival British girl group Girls Aloud accused the All Saints single of sounding like one of Girls Aloud's. In an interview with MTV UK, group member Blatt sarcastically responded to the accusation: "'Jump (for My Love)' is so where I wanna be. [...] We could only aspire and dream to be like them (Girls Aloud). Hopefully one day we will achieve that. For now, we will have to make do with copying them." In the same interview, Nicole responded: "We all have vaginas. That's about as similar as it gets." Lewis went on to say that she doesn't care what Girls Aloud thinks, referring to them as "stupid little girls". Lewis later substantiated her reference in another interview, saying:
We [All Saints] say what we want. As long as we stand true and say what we believe, it's fine. I stand by it and I mean it. If you [Cheryl] say things about people for any other reason you have to be careful because you will bump into them. So you'd better mean what you say. We are four feisty women with a lot of attitude. We're confident because we're older now. People forget they're not talking Girls Aloud or Sugababes – we're 30-odd-year-old women so we aren't dizzy anymore. It's not cockiness, it's maturity. The industry is so false and we know that but when you're younger you think it's the be all and end all.
However, Girls Aloud member Sarah Harding rubbished reports of the feud, saying: "[...] It was taken out of proportion, twisted and they [All Saints] retaliated. I actually had a drink with Natalie Appleton and Liam Gallagher the other week as we have a mutual friend – everything is fine, honestly."
Critical reception.
John Murphy from musicOMH was positive in his review of the song, saying it was a good example of how at ease the group sounded with their new direction. He called it "fresh and cool", and also complimented the Appleton sisters' backing vocals, noting they "fit in beautifully". Matthew Chisling of AllMusic described the song as a "kicking track" and "solid dance hit with enticing grooves". M. H. Lo of Stylus Magazine gave the track a nine out of ten rating, complimenting its "brilliantly insistent chorus" as well as its backing track, "the song will not leave your mind as long as you're willing to give it three spins. The golden age of British girl bands receives reinforcements". Virgin Medias Hamish Champ mentioned that "one can't help feeling that the quartet has made a conscious decision to move into Girls Aloud territory". Leon McDermott from the "Sunday Herald" also gave the song a positive review, saying: "An updated take on the sound they made their own, it adds cheeky nods to Jamaican-inspired two tone, ska and rock steady the genre that provides the title for their skanking, jumping comeback single".
However, the song was also criticised. Mickey McMonagle from "Sunday Mail" said there was "too much of the old Girls Aloud sound about this comeback single for me to get too excited", and that he expected something more fresh and exciting for the group's comeback. Paul Connolly from the "Evening Standard" mentioned that the song "does smack off cynicism, however. It sounds like a 50/50 splice of Girls Aloud's pop dynamism and Sugababes' slouchy thrift-shop R&amp;B. It really doesn't do the girls any justice". He completed his review of the song saying it was not "a terrible song – it's just kind of pointless". Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog gave the single a two-star rating, commenting that "the Saints are acting quite devilishly in pinching approximately 98.3% of their sound, mixing it with the dodgy checkered-trousered leftovers from the Ordinary Boys' "Brassbound", and throwing in every single senseless lyric from every single girl band song ever".
Chart performance.
In the United Kingdom, "Rock Steady" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 11 on the issue dated 11 November 2006. It was the second highest new entry in the chart for that week, behind U2 and Green Day collaboration single "The Saints Are Coming", which debuted at number six. The chart debut of the song marked All Saints' first appearance on the chart since "All Hooked Up" (2001). The next week, it faced competition from rival girl band Sugababes' new single and "Easy", which also had debuted the previous week at number 30. On 18 November, the song climbed eight places to reach a peak of number three, outpeaking the Sugababes single who peaked at number eight for that week. "Rock Steady" spent ten weeks on the chart before exiting at number 65, on 13 January 2007. As of July 2018, the song was the group's eighth best selling single in the United Kingdom.
In Austria, "Rock Steady" debuted at number 67 on 17 November 2006, before peaking at number 20 on 22 December 2006. It spent a total of 12 weeks on the chart. The track debuted and peaked at number 10 in Finland, becoming the group's third top 10 hit there. "Rock Steady" debuted at number 40 in Hungary, but later peaked at number five on the chart issued for the sixth week of 2007; it spent 17 weeks on the chart. The song peaking at number 15 in Ireland, becoming All Saints' eighth top 20 hit in the country and spending a total of five weeks in the chart. "Rock Steady" peaked at number 16 in Italy and spent a total of four weeks in the chart. On 12 November 2006, "Rock Steady" debuted and peaked at number 10 in Spain, spending a total of three weeks on the chart. In Switzerland, it debuted at number 40 on 3 December 2006, later peaking at number 37 for two weeks, spending a total of 11 weeks on the chart.
Music video.
Weeks of planning went into shooting the music video for "Rock Steady" in Cuba: booking flights for all staff, hiring equipment and arranging locations. However, All Saints were not able to sit together in first class travel to Cuba, they either had to "unacceptably" go on separate flights or sit in economy class and as a result the shoot for the music video was moved to Bucharest in Romania at the expense of Parlophone Records. It was directed by W.I.Z., who also directed the video for the group's 1998 single "War of Nerves". The video was also produced by Laura Kanerick. It was released exclusively through Yahoo! Launch on 30 September 2006.
The music video is set in black and white, with occasional streaks of yellow or red visible for dramatic emphasis. It begins with a consecutive, quick close-up of each group member. Natalie, first, is seen with tied-back hair and black sunglasses turning around. Lewis, second, is seen with loose hair removing her sunglasses. Nicole, third, is seen wearing a tilted black hat and a veil over her face. Blatt, last, is wearing a European-styled black cap with her hair curled to volume and is depicted throughout the video reading "The Thief's Journal" by Jean Genet. A scene is then focused around the atmosphere outside a fictional bank named "La Banca dei Fortunati", as the girls begin to arrive. The name of the bank director is "Benito Berlusconi".
The scene then shifts to an ATM where money is seen ejecting. Lewis and Nicole then walk into the bank holding whips. Natalie comes through another entrance with her glasses on her head. With security all around, Natalie acts innocent by pretending to be doing her make-up while she waits for Nicole and Lewis to act out the robbery. The latter ones are then seen sitting down at a table making a deal with the bank managers. At this stage, Natalie goes back outside and puts her sunglasses back on. She stares at one of the security guards as blood starts dripping underneath her sunglasses from her eyes to the extent that the ground enlarges in a circle of blood before the screen flashes out in red. In another scene, Nicole removes her hat, and begins crawling to escape the bank whilst Blatt is waiting outside. Natalie and Lewis are now in the bank area where they make use of a whip to frighten the civilians, who put their hands in the air and begin doing an almost robotic dance routine. The group then makes their escape via a motorcycle and side car.
Live performances.
All Saints performed "Rock Steady" live on Ant &amp; Dec's "Saturday Night Takeaway", on 21 October 2006. This was the first time the group performed live together in five years since their split in 2001. On 25 October 2006, All Saints performed the single live in a setlist of six songs, five from "Studio 1" and signature hit single "Pure Shores" at the Sheperd's Bush Pavilion in London. The group wore black or white-coloured shirts teamed with big, loose-knotted ties. Before the show, Shaznay Lewis addressed the crowd saying "We're very nervous, you know" and Nicole Appleton said that she was "emotional" after the gig. Chris Elwell-Sutton of the "Evening Standard" reviewed the performance saying "'Rock Steady' was another energetic, commercially viable highlight". James McNair of "The Independent" gave the gig a five star rating, saying: "The superb new single 'Rock Steady' shifts things up a gear, All Saints nailing their dancehall influences to the mast and engaging in some neat, microphone-swapping choreography".
The single was then performed live on "Popworld" on 4 November as part of its promotion leading up to its release on 6 November. On 14 November, they appeared on "Top of the Pops" for a performance of the single. The girls also showed up at BBC's "Children in Need" on 17 November to perform the single. All Saints performed the song live as the opening act on "The Chart Show" on 18 November 2006, alongside acts like Girls Aloud and McFly. The group also performed "Pure Shores" at the event and the following was said about their performances: "They didn't disappoint [...] the party was now well under way." All Saints also performed "Rock Steady" on Channel 4's "T4", aired on the same day.
"Rock Steady" was included on the setlist for their first headlining show in over a decade at London's KOKO, on 4 April 2016, and was performed as part of the setlist of their 2016 Red Flag Tour. All Saints also performed it on their Electric Brixton set in July 2018.

Fort Ward (Virginia)

Fort Ward is a former Union Army installation now located in the city of Alexandria in the U.S. state of Virginia. It was the fifth largest fort built to defend Washington, D.C. in the American Civil War. It is currently well-preserved with 90-95% of its earthen walls intact.
Occupation of Arlington.
Before the outbreak of the Civil War, Alexandria County, the closest part of Virginia to Washington, D.C., was a predominantly rural area. Originally part of the District of Columbia, the land now comprising the county was retroceded to Virginia in a July 9, 1846 act of Congress that took effect in 1847. Most of the county is hilly, and at the time, most of the county's population was concentrated in the city of Alexandria, at the far southeastern corner of the county. In 1861, the rest of the county largely consisted of scattered farms, the occasional house, fields for grazing livestock, and Arlington House, owned by Mary Custis, wife of Robert E. Lee.
Following the surrender of Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 14, 1861, new American president Abraham Lincoln declared that "an insurrection existed," and called for 75,000 troops to be called up to quash the rebellion. The move sparked resentment in many other southern states, which promptly moved to convene discussions of secession. The Virginia State Convention passed "an ordinance of secession" and ordered a May 23 referendum to decide whether or not the state should secede from the Union. The U.S. Army responded by creating the Department of Washington, which united all Union troops in the District of Columbia and Maryland under one command.
Brigadier General J.F.K. Mansfield, commander of the Department of Washington, argued that Northern Virginia should be occupied as soon as possible in order to prevent the possibility of the Confederate Army mounting artillery on the hills of Arlington and shelling government buildings in Washington. He also urged the erection of fortifications on the Virginia side of the Potomac River to protect the southern terminuses of the Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge. His superiors approved these recommendations, but decided to wait until after Virginia voted for or against secession.
On May 23, 1861, Virginia voted by a margin of 3 to 1 in favor of leaving the Union. That night, U.S. Army troops began crossing the bridges linking Washington, D.C. to Virginia. The march, which began at 10 p.m. on the night of the 23rd, was described in colorful terms by the New York Herald two days later:
There can be no more complaints of inactivity of the government. The forward march movement into Virginia, indicated in my despatches last night, took place at the precise time this morning that I named, but in much more imposing and powerful numbers.
About ten o'clock last night four companies of picked men moved over the Long Bridge, as an advance guard. They were sent to reconnoitre, and if assailed were ordered to signal, when they would have been reinforced by a corps of regular infantry and a battery...
At twelve o'clock the infantry regiment, artillery and cavalry corps began to muster and assume marching order. As fast as the several regiments were ready they proceeded to the Long Bridge, those in Washington being directed to take that route.
The troops quartered at Georgetown, the Sixty-ninth, Fifth, Eighth and Twenty-eighth New York regiments, proceeded across what is known as the chain bridge, above the mouth of the Potomac Aqueduct, under the command of General McDowell. They took possession of the heights in that direction.
The imposing scene was at the Long Bridge, where the main body of the troops crossed. Eight thousand infantry, two regular cavalry companies and two sections of Sherman's artillery battalion, consisting of two batteries, were in line this side of the Long Bridge at two o'clock.
The occupation of Northern Virginia was peaceful, with the sole exception of the town of Alexandria. There, as Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth, commander of the New York Fire Zouaves (11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment), entered a local hotel to remove the Confederate flag flying above it, he was shot and killed by James W. Jackson, the proprietor. Ellsworth was one of the first men killed in the American Civil War. Jackson was then killed by invading Federal soldiers of the 11th New York. Throughout the remainder of the war, Alexandria would lean strongly towards the Confederate government, necessitating continued occupation by a Union garrison.
Battle of Bull Run.
Over the seven weeks that followed the occupation of northern Virginia, forts were constructed along the banks of the Potomac River and at the approaches to each of the three major bridges (Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge) connecting Virginia to Washington and Georgetown.
While the Potomac River forts were being built, planning and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts to protect the city. Unlike the fortifications under construction, the new forts would defend the city in all directions, not just the most direct route through Arlington. In mid-July, this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run. As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas, the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle. In the days that followed the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington.
On July 26, 1861, five days after the battle, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was named commander of the military district of Washington and the subsequently renamed Army of the Potomac. Upon arriving in Washington, McClellan was appalled by the condition of the city's defenses.
In no quarter were the dispositions for defense such as to offer a vigorous resistance to a respectable body of the enemy, either in the position and numbers of the troops or the number and character of the defensive works... not a single defensive work had been commenced on the Maryland side. There was nothing to prevent the enemy shelling the city from heights within easy range, which could be occupied by a hostile column almost without resistance.
To remedy the situation, one of McClellan's first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand the defenses of Washington. At all points of the compass, forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to defeat any attack. Alexandria, which contained the southern terminus of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and one of the largest ports in the Chesapeake Bay, was an object of "anxious study."
Planning and construction.
It was named for US Navy Commander James H. Ward, killed at Mathias Point. It was designed with a perimeter of 540 yards and platforms for 24 guns. Later, a 100-pound Parrott gun was added. The larger guns made the fort vulnerable if besieged. In 1863, the perimeter was expanded to 818 yards with room for 36 guns.
Gen. John Newton, who was in charge of the forts south of Four Mile Run, supervised the construction and managed the flow of men and material.
Liberated slaves, also known as "contrabands", helped build the defenses to protect Washington from invasion by Confederate forces during the Civil War. The Fort was named for the first Union naval officer to die in the war. Fort Ward never saw any attacks, and was dismantled in November 1865, though many African- Americans continued to live there into the 1900s.
Fort Ward Museum.
The fort is now a part of the City of Alexandria's Fort Ward Museum and Historic Site adjacent to Braddock Road, and the museum offers rotating exhibits on American Civil War subjects and a Civil War library. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and hosts Civil War and Revolutionary War reenactments. The historic area now includes a museum, an Officer's Hut, Ceremonial Gate, and reconstructed northwest bastion. The site can be found at 4301 West Braddock Road in Alexandria, Virginia.
In the early 1960s, the land was bought by the city of Alexandria to stop a housing development. The city took 44 acres across Braddock Road from Episcopal High School, reconstructed the old fort and made a park.

2001 American Le Mans Series

The 2001 American Le Mans Series season was the third season for the IMSA American Le Mans Series, and the 31st overall season of the IMSA GT Championship. It was a series for Le Mans Prototypes (LMP) and Grand Touring (GT) race cars divided into 4 classes: LMP900, LMP675, GTS, and GT. It began March 4, 2001 and ended October 6, 2001 after 10 races.
This season shared events with the new European Le Mans Series, with two events being held in Europe.
Schedule.
The schedule for the 2001 featured the only time in ALMS history that the opening event was not the 12 Hours of Sebring, instead being preceded by the Grand Prix of Texas. After Sebring, the two ELMS rounds at Donington Park and Jarama were optional for ALMS teams as the next North American event was not until after Le Mans. The Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course was added to the schedule, replacing previous races at Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Charlotte Motor Speedway. This was the last season to feature events held on road courses at oval circuits.

Virginia Film Festival

The Virginia Film Festival is a program of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. The film festival is held annually during 4 days, usually in late October or early November.
History.
Created in October 1988, the Virginia Festival of American Film (renamed The Virginia Film Festival) was endorsed by the state's Department of Economic Development and adopted by the University of Virginia. The intent was twofold: to stimulate economic development by encouraging film production in Virginia and increasing tourism, and to meld the creative interests and crafts of the American film industry with the intellectual resources of a nationally ranked university.
In 1996, the festival was affiliated with the drama department of the University of Virginia. In 2002, the Festival moved to the Dean's office in the College of Arts and Science and then to the media studies department. The Festival's focus was expanded to encompass a broader range of international films, year-round programs, and a very active Film Society that presents films and guest speakers at the downtown Vinegar Hill Theatre.
The first two premieres at the festival were "Child's Play" and "Mystic Pizza".
In 2009, Jody Kielbasa, the founding director of the Sarasota Film Festival, was brought on as the new director of the Virginia Film Festival.
From 1990 through 2009, Virginia Film Festival chose a different theme each year on which to base its film program. Past themes are listed below. Starting in 2010, the Festival announced its intention to leave the themed approach in favor of more flexible programming. The VAFF celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2012.
Venues that have hosted the festival include the Paramount Theater, the Violet Crown and Vinegar Hill theaters in downtown Charlottesville, and facilities at the University of Virginia.
Films and guests.
Notable screenings have included a 25th Anniversary tribute to In the Heat of the Night and Sidney Poitier, Distinguished Filmmaker presentations to Robert Altman, John Sayles, Emile de Antonio, and Arthur Penn, as well as Roger Ebert's "shot by shot" workshops on classics such as "Vertigo", "Sunset Boulevard", and "The Third Man". Memorable premiere events have included an advance screening of Mother &amp; Child with actress Cherry Jones and director Rodrigo Garcia and a live producer's commentary of the show "True Blood" featuring its creator Alan Ball.
Notable guests have included Jimmy Stewart, Fay Wray, Gregory Peck, Ossie Davis, Nick Nolte, Norman Mailer, Jerzy Kosinski, Sissy Spacek, William Kennedy, Ann Beattie, Sandra Bullock, Nicolas Cage, Anthony Hopkins, Robert Mitchum, Gov.

Lautaro (volcano)

Lautaro is an active subglacial stratovolcano located in Chilean Patagonia, in the northern part of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. Its summit rises roughly above the average surface of the ice cap plateau.
Geography and geomorphology.
Lautaro is located within the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, and is the highest summit in its area. Bad weather and remote location make the volcano difficult to access. The existence of a volcano at Lautaro was recognized in 1879, but it was identified as Lautaro only in 1961. The volcano was named in 1952; it was originally named "volcán de Los Gigantes" and sometimes confused with the neighbouring non-volcano Cerro FitzRoy.
The volcano is a composite volcano and a stratovolcano covered with glaciers. Its elevation is variously given as , or . It rises about above the surrounding ice, and bears traces of glacial erosion. The edifice covers an area of about and about 90% of it is covered with ice. It has a parasitic vent on the western side and two volcanic craters just north of the summit, one of which is wide. The Lautaro Glacier descends the western slope, while the icefield at the eastern foot is drained by the O'Higgins Glacier.
It is part of the Austral Volcanic Zone (AVZ), a belt of volcanoes in southwesternmost South America that includes (from north to south) Lautaro, Viedma, Aguilera, Reclus, Burney and Cook. All these volcanoes do not exceed height and most have produced tephras during the Holocene. North of Lautaro comes first a volcanic gap, then Mount Hudson from the Southern Volcanic Zone.
Geology.
Off the southwestern tip of South America, the Antarctic Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate at a rate of . The subduction process is responsible for the volcanism of the AVZ. To the north the subduction zone is limited by the Chile Triple Junction, to the south it gradually leads into the Magallanes-Fagnano fault zone. Other volcanoes in the region are Cerro Pampa northeast of Lautaro, which was active in the Miocene, Cerro del Fraile south-southeast and the Pali-Aike volcanic field far southeast of it.
With the exception of a granite outcrop west of the volcano, the basement under Lautaro is hidden beneath ice, but in the rest of the AVZ it consists of Paleozoic-Mesozoic metamorphic rocks, subsequent Mesozoic to Cenozoic volcanic rocks and sediments. Several AVZ volcanoes are located close to or on the South Patagonian Batholith.
Lautaro has erupted dacite with a porphyritic to vitrophyric texture. Phenocrysts include biotite, clinopyroxene, hornblende, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and quartz. Rocks of the AVZ define an adakitic suite. The peculiar composition of AVZ magmas appears to reflect the melting of slab rocks from the downgoing Antarctic Plate.
Eruption history.
Potassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 161,000±11,000 to 30,000±73,000 years years. A 43,400 years old tephra layer in Laguna Potrok Aike might originate from Lautaro, while the attribution of 35,600 and 34,200 years old tephra layers to this volcano is less certain. Two tephra layers in Lago Cardiel emplaced 3,345 and 3,010 years ago could come from Lautaro or another northern AVZ volcano. Three tephra layers in the Lago Viedma-Lago San Martin have been attributed to Lautaro.
Lautaro is the most historically active volcano of the AVZ, with several eruptions. Activity is recorded from 1876, 1878–1879, 1883, 1933, 1945, 1959–1960, 1972 and 1978–1979. The 1959 eruption was observed from aircraft, clarifying the position of the volcano, and is the only well-documented historic eruption in the AVZ. Other possible eruptions took place in 1876, 1878, 1972 and 1976, and an unknown volcano erupted in 1886.
In the outflow glaciers of the Patagonian ice cap and in aerial photographs, volcanic ash and pumice from Lautaro have been noted on adjacent glaciers; block-and-ash flows may indicate the past occurrence of lava domes or coulees. Tephra layers from several historical eruptions have been found in adjacent lakes, where ecosystems were altered by the ash fallout. However, distinguishing between Lautaro tephras and these of neighbouring volcanoes is difficult.
In 1960 a fissure on the northern side was seen producing steam. Fumarolic activity was also observed in 1964, and smelled of sulfur. Continuing fumarolic activity was observed in 1974.
Ascent history.
The first ascent of Lautaro was made by Peter Skvarca and Luciano Pera, on 29 January 1964. They climbed the southeast ridge, encountering many crevasses, some steep ice walls, cornices, and a snow mushroom at the summit. They found an active crater and strong sulfurous emissions near the summit. The second ascent was made by Eric Jones, Mick Coffey, and Leo Dickinson on 2 March 1973, as part of a crossing of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. Both the Pacific Ocean and the mountains to the east are visible from its summit.

Amethystine python

The amethystine python (Simalia amethistina, formerly known as Morelia amethistina), also known as the scrub python or sanca permata in Indonesian, is a species of non-venomous snake in the family Pythonidae. The species is found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Popular among reptile enthusiasts, and noted for its coloration and size, it is one of the largest snakes in the world, as measured either by length or weight, and is the largest native snake in Papua New Guinea. Until 2000, the larger Australian species "S. kinghorni" was generally considered a subspecies of "S. amethistina", and this change of classification has still not been universally reflected in literature. Because of this issue, "S. amethistina" has often been described as the largest snake in Australia, but this is not accurate since under the current classification, this species does not occur in Australia.
Taxonomy.
Formerly, five subspecies of "Morelia amethistina", including the nominate race, "M. a. amethystina", were generally recognized. The Moluccan Islands (including Halmahera, Ternate and Tidore) are home to the former "M. a. tracyae". The Tanimbar Islands are home to a smaller subspecies, the former "M. a. nauta". On the island of Seram, the former "M. a. clastolepis" can be found. On mainland of Papua New Guinea (including the Indonesian western half, once called Irian Jaya—now West Papua), and many of its nearby offshore islands, the former "M. a. amethystina" is quite common. In Australia, the former "M. a. kinghorni" is represented. American biologist Michael Harvey and colleagues investigated the amethystine python complex and recognised five separate species "Simalia amethistina", "Simalia clastolepis", "Simalia kinghorni", "Simalia nauta", and "Simalia tracyae" based on cladistic analysis of cytochrome b sequences and morphology. In 2014 cladistic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial genes of pythons and boas, R. Graham Reynolds and colleagues supported the distinctness of "M. tracyae", "M. amethistina", and "M. clastolepis", but were less confident of "M. kinghorni" and "M. nauta".
According to McDiarmid "et al." (1999), all cases in which the specific name was spelled with a "y" follow Daudin's (1803) "Python amethystinus" and are therefore unjustified emendations. The specific name, "amethistina", is an allusion to the milky iridescent sheen on its scales, which gives it an amethyst-like colour.
Description.
Specimens of "S. amethistina" have reportedly been measured at more than in total length (including tail), but this is exceptional, as specimens are already considered extremely large. Although the amethystine python is smaller than the Australian scrub python, some sources claim that "S. amethistina" is able to reach lengths of , with a weight up to and perhaps even . 
The smooth dorsal scales are arranged in 39–53 rows at midbody. There are deep, heat-sensing pits on six or seven of the posterior lower labials.
Distribution and habitat.
The Amethystine python is found in Indonesia (Maluku Islands, Timur Laut Islands, Banda, Kai Islands, Aru Islands, Misool, Salawati, most of Western New Guinea, many islands in Geelvink Bay, such as Biak, Numfor, Yapen, and Supiori), and Papua New Guinea (including Umboi Island, Bismarck Archipelago, Trobriand Islands, the d'Entrecasteaux Islands to Rossel Island, Louisiade Archipelago). The type locality is unknown.
"S. amethistina" occurs in both bushland and suburbia. In Indonesia, it is found mostly in rainforests. Warm, humid habitats with good water sources are preferred. In New Guinea, it mostly lives in scrublands.
Feeding.
The diet of the amethystine python generally consists of birds, bats, rats, possums, and other small mammals. Larger Papuan specimens catch and eat wallabies, and cuscus, waiting by creek and river banks for prey seeking drinking water.

Kenneth Lane (physicist)

Kenneth Douglas Lane is an American theoretical particle physicist and professor of physics at Boston University. Lane is best known for his role in the development of extended technicolor models of physics beyond the Standard Model.
Career.
Lane received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. in physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and was a student of Chung Wook Kim at Johns Hopkins University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1970.
His physics research focuses on the problems of electroweak and flavor symmetry breaking. With Estia J. Eichten, Lane co-invented extended technicolor. He and Eichten also contributed to early work on charmonium with Kurt Gottfried, Tom Kinoshita and Tung-Mow Yan.
In 1984 he coauthored "Supercollider Physics" (with Eichten, Ian Hinchliffe and Chris Quigg), which has strongly influenced the quest for future discoveries at hadron colliders such as the Fermilab Tevatron the SSC, and the LHC at CERN. In 2011 Dr Lane with Chris Quigg, Estia Eichten, and Ian Hinchliffe won the J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics "For their work, separately and collectively, to chart a course of the exploration of TeV scale physics using multi-TeV hadron colliders" 
He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1990 "for original contributions to the theory of electroweak symmetry breaking and Supercollider physics"

Johan Peter Koch

Johan Peter Koch (15 January 1870 – 13 January 1928) was a Danish captain and explorer of the Arctic dependencies of Denmark, born at Vestenskov. He was the uncle of the geologist Lauge Koch
Career.
J.P. Koch participated in Amdrup's expedition to east Greenland in 1900 and was one of the general staff of the surveying expeditions to Iceland in 1903–1904.
In 1906–1908 he was a member of the ill-fated Denmark expedition led by Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen, which mapped the last pieces of the northeastern coast of Greenland. On the death of Mylius-Erichsen and two others on a long sled voyage from Danmarkshavn to Peary Land, Koch along with the Greenlander Tobias Gabrielsen searched for the lost party, and found only the Greenlander Jørgen Brønlund on whose body were recovered the charts hand drawn by Niels Peter Høeg Hagen which completed the map of Greenland.
In 1907 Koch, together with Aage Bertelsen, was reported to have first seen Fata Morgana Land (), a phantom island supposedly lying between NE Greenland and Svalbard. This elusive land was allegedly seen as well by Lauge Koch from the air in 1933.
Koch later led the 1912–13 Danish Expedition to Queen Louise Land, a sled expedition across the inland ice of Greenland, also known as the "1912-13 Danish Expedition to Queen Louise Land and across North Greenland’s Inland Ice," with Alfred Wegener, Vigfús Sigurðsson, and Lars Larsen.
Honours.
Koch received, among other honors, the Vega medal of the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography. He also became a member of the International Polar Commission.
J.P. Koch Land in north-west Greenland was named after him. This ice-free peninsula is bounded by the Greenland Ice Sheet on the west side. There, next to the glacier, is mountain, which is the highest mountain in this land and also the northernmost basalt mountain in Greenland. On the north side, J.P. Koch land is bounded by Upernavik Icefjord, in the west and south by Eqaluarssuit Fjord (). The land is about 1010 square-km in area.
The J.P. Koch Glacier was named in his honour.

Museum of Comparative Zoology

The Museum of Comparative Zoology (formally the Agassiz Museum of Comparative Zoology and often abbreviated to MCZ) is a zoology museum located on the grounds of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is one of three natural-history research museums at Harvard, whose public face is the Harvard Museum of Natural History. 
Harvard MCZ's collections consist of some 21 million specimens, of which several thousand are on rotating public display. While the research collections of the MCZ are not open to the public, the museum maintains MCZbase, a public database of its zoological collections.
Many of the exhibits in the public museum have not only zoological interest, but also historical significance. Past exhibits have featured a fossil sand dollar collected by Charles Darwin in 1834, a mamo collected by Captain James Cook, and two golden pheasants that once belonged to George Washington.
Gonzalo Giribet, Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard and Curator of Invertebrate Zoology, has served as the museum's director since 2021.
History.
The Museum of Comparative Zoology was founded in 1859 through the efforts of zoologist Louis Agassiz; the museum used to be referred to as "The Agassiz" after its founder. Agassiz designed the collection to illustrate the variety and comparative relationships of animal life. According to Goodale, "What he had in mind, as indicated by hints in his reports and other communications, was a museum for research and illustration in all departments of what was then called natural history. It was intended to comprise everything from minerals, through the kingdom of plants, to the highest animals. It was to include also man regarded from an archaeological and ethnological point of view." Alexander Agassiz was his father's assistant until 1875 when Alexander became curator. Alexander Agassiz served for 23 years as curator, 10 as director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and from 1902, until his death, as director of the University Museum, comprising all the sections. His gifts to the museum and to other departments of Harvard University considerably exceeded a million dollars.
Many female paleontologists, such as Elvira Wood, were involved in the early development of the museum.
The Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory was created in 1894 when Radcliffe College rented a space on the fifth floor of the MCZ to convert into a women's laboratory. Prior to this acquisition, Radcliffe science laboratories were taught using inadequate facilities, converting spaces such as bathrooms in old houses into physics laboratories, in which Harvard professors often refused to teach. The laboratory space was converted from an office or storage closet, and was sandwiched between other invertebrate storage rooms on the fifth floor.
Departments.
The museum has nine departments with research collections: Entomology, Herpetology, Ichthyology, Invertebrate Paleontology, Invertebrate Zoology, Mammalogy, Malacology, Ornithology, and Vertebrate Paleontology. The Ernst Mayr Library and its archives form the tenth department of the museum. The library is a founding member of the Biodiversity Heritage Library.
Publications.
The museum publishes two journals: the "Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College", first published in 1869, and "Breviora", first published in 1956.
Displays.
In contrast to numerous more modern museums, the Harvard Museum of Natural History has many hundreds of taxidermy animals on display, from the MCZ collections. Notable exhibits include whale skeletons, the largest turtle shell ever found (8 ft long), "the Harvard mastodon", a long "Kronosaurus" skeleton, the skeleton of a dodo, and a coelacanth preserved in fluid. The two-story Great Mammal Hall was renovated in 2009 in celebration of the 150th anniversary of founding of the museum.
Changing exhibitions at the museum have included "Evolution" (2008); "The Language of Color" (2008 to 2013); "Arthropods: Creatures that Rule" (2006); "New England Forests" (2011); and "Mollusks: Shelled Masters of the Marine Realm" (2012).

Dongshan County

 () is a county of far southern Fujian Province, People's Republic of China, located along the Taiwan Strait. It comprises 44 islands for a total area of , and is under the administration of Zhangzhou City. The total population was around 220,000 in 2020. Dongshan County has jurisdiction over seven towns, a nationally managed forest and an economic and technological development district. It is an important port for international trade and trade with Taiwan.
History.
On one of the islands, there are several ancient relics, including the 'Mountain of the Nine Immortals', and the Dongshan ancient city, where two famous Ming Dynasty generals, Qi Jiguang and Zheng Chenggong were based.
Tongling Town on Northeastern Dongshan Island has an ancient waterside castle. Tonghshan Castle was built of stone in 1387 by Zhou Dexing of the Ming Dynasty to protect against Japanese pirates. The gate tower still stands intact. Inside, a path is linked by corridors and the exquisite Temple of Guan Yu. The entrance to the temple is flanked by ancient houses, the birthplace of Huang Daozhou, an official of the Ming Dynasty.
In 1950, at the end of the Chinese Civil War, the island was the scene of fighting between the nationalist Kuomintang and Chinese Communist forces, and again in 1953 during the so-called Dongshan Island Campaign, an unsuccessful attempt by the nationalists to retake the island.
Economy.
Dongshan County is situated between two economically vibrant cities of Xiamen and Shantou. Both are Special Economic Zones which have spillover economic effects for Dongshan County, such as increased tourism. The total GDP of islands in 2003 was 3.62 billion yuan. The main industries are fishery, fish farming and asparagus farming.
Tourism.
The tourism industry is based on rich ancient history, seaside resorts and breath taking scenery.
Administration.
There are seven towns () under the county's administration:
The county has jurisdiction over a nationally managed forest and an economic and technological development district.
Geography and climate.
Dongshan is located in the southernmost part of the province, with Kaohsiung, Taiwan to the east and Hong Kong to the southwest.
The climate of the Dongshan Islands is humid subtropical (Köppen "Cfa") and moderated by their coastal location, without frost through the year. In winter, north-east winds, and in summer south-east winds prevail. The annual average temperature is . The coolest month of the year is February with an average temperature of ; the hottest, July, with an average temperature of . The annual average rainfall is only , which causes a shortage of fresh water, especially from October to January. Additional water must be acquired from outside for both domestic and industrial use.
Transport.
Dongshan Port is one of the main ports in Fujian, open to foreign vessels since 2003 and very close to Taiwan and Hong Kong. The port has a large body of water, large hinterland, and a deep, sediment-free harbour. The harbour is big enough for twenty-two 10,000 tons berths. Currently, the port has two deep water harbours built to accommodate 3,000 tons berths. These facilities provide Dongshan Port an important commercial link between Xiamen and Shantou.

Micro-Phonies (album)

Micro-Phonies is the sixth full-length studio album by British electronic band Cabaret Voltaire. Released 29 October 1984, the album was the group's most mainstream release to date, with the singles "Sensoria" and "James Brown" gaining popularity, especially the former, due to the music video finding MTV airplay. 
The album sees Cabaret Voltaire continuing to change, pursuing the more electro and synthpop-oriented direction they had started shifting towards on "The Crackdown".
Production and release.
It was co-produced with British engineer Flood.
The songs "Sensoria" and "Blue Heat" get alternative 12" mixes on the CD version of "Micro-Phonies".
Reception.
"The Rolling Stone Album Guide" gave "Micro-Phonies" a more positive review, compared to its predecessors in the discography and called the duo's "most exhilarating work", highlighting the improvement in Cabaret Voltaire's ability to "convert its interest in static structures into anything resembling conventional dance music", although with limited melody. The guide praised its accessibility paired with "menace" of their previous records, noticing a pop appeal in the songs "Do Right" and "Spies in the Wires", created through the chemistry between Stephen Mallinder's vocals and Richard H. Kirk's "churning electronics".
In AllMusic review, Ned Raggett favorably compared "Micro-Phonies" to the Cabaret Voltaire's previous discography, lauding its invention of "the shadowy, murkier side of industrial/noise experimentation". Raggett singled out the "funky, horn-heavy" song "James Brown", the "gripping" song "Sensoria", and brilliantly subtle "The Operative" as highlights. Raggett saw dub influences scattered throughout the album, in particular on "Digital Rasta". He also appreciated the Mallinder ability to "submerges his vocals into the music rather than calling overt attention to them".
Music video.
The music video for "Sensoria" was directed by Peter Care, and attracted airplay on MTV. It was voted Best Video of the Year by the "Los Angeles Times" in 1985, and was later procured by the New York Museum of Modern Art.
Legacy.
A poster for the album is visible on Ferris Bueller's wall in the 1986 film "Ferris Bueller's Day Off".

Furesø (lake)

Furesø is a lake in Northeastern Zealand, Denmark and the deepest lake in Denmark. It defined the former Farum municipality's southeasthern border and is the site of Nicolai Eigtved's 18th century small pleasure pavilion for Privy Councillor Johan Sigismund Schulin on the Furesø Lake called Frederiksdal Pavilion.
The lake neighbours the adjacent Farum Lake, to which it is connected by a short stream, Fiskebaek. 
It is the namesake of Furesø municipality, which was formed January 1, 2007 as a merger of the two former municipalities Farum and Værløse. It has a popular beach on its western shore, which is within the municipality.

Rosa and Eliana Martínez

Eliana Martínez (September 15, 1981 – November 27, 1989) was an American adoptee who contracted HIV from a blood transfusion as an infant. Her adoptive mother, Rosa Martínez (February 20, 1952 – August 18, 2022), fought for Eliana to be allowed to attend a public school without being isolated from other students by transparent partitions, referred to by Rosa Martínez as a "glass cage". Eliana died of complications from AIDS seven months after winning the right to attend a special education program without being physically isolated from other students.
Biography.
Early life.
Eliana Martínez was born prematurely on September 15, 1981, in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. She received thirty-nine blood transfusions in the first four months of life, thereby receiving contaminated blood with HIV from one of them.
Unable to care for Eliana nor her four older siblings, her biological parents were denied custody of her. The first eleven months of her life were spent in the hospital where she was born until she was adopted by Joe and Rosa Martínez. (The couple separated in 1986.) Eliana had multiple handicaps and was mistakenly diagnosed with cerebral palsy until the diagnosis of AIDS-related complex was confirmed; her handicaps were due to the effects of AIDS. She was diagnosed with AIDS-Related Complex in April 1985. Eliana was treated with AZT for two years and later with ddl.
Legal challenges to attend school.
In November 1986, Rosa Martínez sought to have Eliana admitted to Manhattan Exceptional Center, a special school operated by Hillsborough County Public Schools. With a tested IQ of 41, Eliana was classified as a trainable mentally handicapped child. The school district wanted Eliana taught at home out of fear she could transmit HIV to others.
After exhausting the appeals process with the school district, Rosa Martínez filed a legal complaint on September 3, 1987, with the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. Judge Elizabeth A. Kovachevich ruled on August 8, 1988, that Eliana could attend the school if isolated by transparent partitions from other students until she was toilet trained and learned to stop sucking her fingers. A notice of appeal was promptly filed and the school district constructed the isolation booth specified in the judge's decision.
On August 25, Judge William Terrell Hodges ruled that Eliana should be tutored at home until the appeal could be heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
In December 1988, the Court of Appeals returned the case to Judge Kovachevich, upholding Eliana's right to be placed in the least restrictive environment unless evidence proved that she posed a significant risk to other children. Judge Kovachevich ruled that Eliana could sit at a desk in a classroom without isolation partitions and Eliana attended her first day of school on April 27, 1989. Eliana adjusted to attending school and only four of the 200 students at the school stopped attending.
Death and aftermath.
Eliana Martínez died on November 27, 1989 in Tampa, Florida. She was buried at Myrtle Hill Memorial Park in Tampa, Florida. She has a panel on block 03098 of the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt.
In March 1991, Rosa Martínez and husband Garth Button became legal guardians for two sisters born with AIDS whose mother had recently died. Following an investigation of allegations that Martínez withheld AIDS treatment from the girls, the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services removed them from the Martínez-Button household. The couple were cleared, but Rosa and her husband agreed the girls should remain with their foster parents to avoid further disruption of their lives.
Rosa Martínez died on August 18, 2022, at the age of 70, and was buried beside Eliana.

Sotāpanna

In Buddhism, a ' (Pali) or ' (Sanskrit)—translated variously as "stream-enterer", "stream-entrant" or "stream-winner"—is one who has reached the first of the four stages of enlightenment. Stream entry is purportedly followed by three subsequent stages of awakening: "Sakadāgāmi" (once-returner), "Anāgāmi" (non-returner), and "Arahant" (fully liberated).
The word "sotāpanna" literally means "one who entered ("āpanna") the stream ("sota"); stream-enterer", after a metaphor which calls the noble eightfold path a stream which leads to a vast ocean, nibbāna. It describes a person who has grasped the "dharma" and thereby dropped the first three fetters (Pāli: ""), namely self-view ("sakkāya-ditthi"), skeptical indecision ("vicikicchā"), and clinging to rites and rituals ("sīlabbata-parāmāsa").
A stream entrant is said to be free from possible rebirth in one of the three lower realms.
Attainment.
The is termed the path of stream-entry ("sotāpatti-magga"), which cuts through the first three fetters. The person who experiences it is called a stream-winner ("sotāpanna").
The sotāpanna is said to attain an intuitive grasp of the "dharma"—this wisdom being called right view ("sammā diṭṭhi")—and has unshakable confidence in the Buddha, "dharma", and "sangha"; this trio is sometimes taken to be the triple refuge, and are at other times listed as being objects of recollection. In general though, confirmed confidence in the Buddha, "dharma", and "sangha" is considered to be one of the four limbs of stream-winning ("sotāpannassa angāni"). The sotapanna is said to have "opened the eye of the Dhamma" ("dhammacakkhu"), because they have realized that whatever arises will cease (impermanence). Their conviction in the true "dharma" would at this point be unshakable.
The sotāpanna has had their first glimpse of the unconditioned element, the "asankhata", in which they see the goal, in ("magga-phala"). Whereas the stream-entrant has seen "nibbāna" and therefore has verified confidence in it, the arahant can drink fully of its waters, to use a simile from the Kosambi Sutta (SN 12.68) of a "well" encountered along a desert road. The sotāpanna "may state this about himself: 'Hell is ended; animal wombs are ended; the state of the hungry shades is ended; states of deprivation, destitution, the bad bourns are ended! I am a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening!'"
The remaining three paths—namely: once-return ("sakadāgāmin"), non-return ("anāgāmin"), and sainthood ("arahatta")—become "destined" ("sammatta niyāma") for the stream-entrant, whose enlightenment as a disciple ("ariya-sāvaka") becomes inevitable within seven lives transmigrating among gods and humans. If they are diligent ("appamatta", "appamāda") in the practice of the Teacher's ("satthāra") message, they may fully awaken within their present life. They have very little future suffering to undergo.
The early Buddhist texts (e.g. the Ratana Sutta) say that a stream-entrant will no longer be born in the animal womb, or hell realms, nor as a hungry ghost. The pathways to unfortunate rebirth destinations ("duggati") have been closed to them.
According to Theravada Buddhism, in the period of 5,000 years after the "parinirvana" of Buddha, we can still attain sotāpanna or even Arhat through practicing "satipatthana", and "satipatthana" is the only way out.
Three fetters.
In the Pali Canon, the qualities of a sotāpanna are described as:
The three fetters which the sotāpanna eradicates are:
Defilements.
According to the Pali commentary, six types of defilement are eventually abandoned by a sotāpanna:
Rebirth.
A sotāpanna is safe from falling into the states of misery (they will not be born as an animal, ghost, or hell being). Their lust, hatred, and delusion are not strong enough to cause rebirth in the lower realms. A sotāpanna will have to be reborn at most only seven more times in the human or heavenly worlds before attaining "nibbāna". It is not necessary for a sotāpanna to be reborn seven more times before attaining "nibbāna", as an ardent practitioner may progress to the higher stages in the same life in which he/she reaches the sotāpanna level by making an aspiration and persistent effort to reach the final goal of "nibbāna".
According to Buddha, there are three types of sotāpannas, classifiable according to their possible rebirths:
Six actions that are not committed.
A sotāpanna will not commit six wrong actions:
Textual references.
Suttas.
The Buddha spoke favorably about the sotāpanna on many occasions. Even though it is (only) the first of "ariya sangha" members, he or she is welcomed by all other "sangha" members for he or she practices for the benefit and welfare of many. In the literature, the "arya sangha" is described as "the four" when taken as pairs, and as "the eight" when taken as individual types. This refers to the four supra-mundane fruits (attainments: "phala") and the corresponding four supra-mundane paths (of those practicing to attain those fruits: "magga").
This is called "the recollection of the Sangha" ("sanghanussati"). It can also be interpreted as: "They are the Blessed One's disciples, who have practiced well, who have practiced directly, who have practiced insight-fully, those who practice with integrity (to share what they have learned with others). They give occasion for incomparable goodness to arise in the world because gifts to them bear great fruit and benefit to the giver."
The fifty-fifth Samyutta of the "Samyutta Nikaya" is called the "Sotāpatti-saṃyutta", and concerns sotāpannas and their attainment. In that chapter's discourse-numbers 1–4, 6–9, 11–14, 16–20, 22–36, 39–49, 51, 53, and 54, sotāpannas are praised as "sangha" members—by and to: the sick, lay followers, people on their deathbed, "bhikkhunis", "bhikkhus", and "devas"—and end up becoming the well-being and benefit of many.
Dhammapada.

John Michell (writer)

John Frederick Carden Michell (9 February 1933 – 24 April 2009) was an English author and esotericist who was a prominent figure in the development of the pseudoscientific Earth mysteries movement. Over the course of his life he published over forty books on an array of different subjects, being a proponent of the Traditionalist school of esoteric thought.
Born in London to a wealthy family, Michell was educated at Cheam School and Eton College before serving as a Russian translator in the Royal Navy for two years. After failing a degree in Russian and German at Trinity College, Cambridge, he qualified as a chartered surveyor then returned to London and worked for his father's property business, there developing his interest in Ufology.
Embracing the counter-cultural ideas of the Earth mysteries movement during the 1960s, in "The Flying Saucer Vision" he built on Alfred Watkins' ideas of ley lines by arguing that they represented linear marks created in prehistory to guide extraterrestrial spacecraft. He followed this with his most influential work, "The View Over Atlantis", in 1969. His ideas were at odds with those of academic archaeologists, for whom he expressed contempt. 
Michell believed in the existence of an ancient spiritual tradition that connected humanity to divinity, but which had been lost as a result of modernity. He believed however that this tradition would be revived and that humanity would enter a Golden Age, with Britain as the centre of this transformation.
Michell's other publications covered an eclectic range of topics, and included an overview on the Shakespeare authorship question, a tract condemning Salman Rushdie during "The Satanic Verses" controversy, and a book of Adolf Hitler's quotations. Keenly interested in the crop circle phenomenon, he co-founded a magazine devoted to the subject, "The Cereologist", in 1990, and served as its initial editor. From 1992 until his death he wrote a column for "The Oldie" magazine, which was largely devoted to his anti-modernist opinions. He accompanied this with a column on esoteric topics for the "Daily Mirror" tabloid.
A lifelong marijuana smoker, Michell died of lung cancer in 2009.
Michell's impact in the Earth mysteries movement was considerable, and through it he also influenced the British Pagan movement. During the 2000s, his ideas also influenced the "Radical Traditionalist" sector of the far right, epitomized by the journal "Tyr".
Biography.
Early life.
John Frederick Carden Michell was born in London on 9 February 1933. His father, Alfred Henry Michell, was of Cornish &amp; Welsh descent and worked as a property dealer in the capital, while his mother Enid Evelyn (née Carden) was the daughter of Major Sir Frederick Carden, 3rd Baronet, great-granddaughter of Sir Robert Carden, 1st Baronet, who served as Lord Mayor of London in 1857, and 3x great-granddaughter of John Walter, founder of "The Times". The eldest of three children, Michell's siblings were named Charles and Clare.
Michell was raised at Stargroves, his maternal grandfather's Victorian-era estate on the Berkshire Downs near to Newbury, and it was here that he developed a love of the countryside, learning about the local flora and fauna from a neighbouring naturalist. He was raised into the Anglican denomination of Christianity, although in later life rejected the religion.
Michell was initially educated as a boarder at the preparatory Cheam School, where he was Head Boy and excelled at the high jump. From there he went to study at Eton College, where he was a contemporary of Lord Moyne and Ian Cameron, the father of future Prime Minister David Cameron.
He spent his two years of national service in the Royal Navy, during which time he qualified as a Russian translator at the School of Slavonic Studies. He then went on to study Russian and German at Trinity College, Cambridge, although was unable to secure a third-class degree. He then qualified as a chartered surveyor at a firm in Gloucestershire, before moving back to London to work for his father's property business. Commenting on this job, he later stated that it was "quite amusing, but of course I wasn't any good at it", with property speculators eroding much of his fortune.
In 1966 one of his properties, the basement of his own residence, became the base of the London Free School. The Black Power activist Michael X, having previously run a gambling club in the basement, had now become active in the organisation of the LFS and brought Michell into counter-culture activities. Michell began to offer courses in UFOs and ley lines.
In 1964, with Jocasta Innes, Michell fathered a son, Jason Goodwin, who also became a writer. The relationship with Innes did not last. Jason Goodwin did not meet his natural father until 1992, at the age of 28, at which point they became quite close.
Embracing the Earth Mysteries movement.
Michell developed an interest in Ufology and Earth mysteries after attending a talk given by Jimmy Goddard at Kensington Central Library on the subject of "Leys and Orthonies" in November 1965. Michell's first publication on the subject of Ufology was the article "Flying Saucers", which appeared in the 30 January 1967 edition of the counter-cultural newspaper "International Times". He proceeded to write a book on the subject, but lost the original manuscript after accidentally leaving it in a North London café, at which he had to rewrite it. The book eventually saw publication as "The Flying Saucer Vision", published in 1967, when Michell was 35 years old.
"The Flying Saucer Vision" took the idea of Tony Wedd that ley lines – alleged trackways across the landscape whose existence was first argued by Alfred Watkins – represented markers for the flight of extraterrestrial spacecraft and built on it, arguing that early human society was aided by alien entities who were understood as gods, but that these extraterrestrials had abandoned humanity because of the latter's greed for material and technological development.
According to Lachman, at this time Michell took the view that "an imminent revelation of literally inconceivable scope" was at hand, and that the appearance of UFOs was linked to "the start of a new phase in our history". Many fans of Michell's work consider it to be "by far his most impressive book". In their social history of Ufology, David Clarke and Andy Roberts stated that Michell's work was "the catalyst and helmsman" for the growing interest in UFOs among the hippie sector of the counter-culture.
Subsequently, there was a shift in Michell's emphasis as he became increasingly interested in the landscapes in which he believed that ley lines could be found rather than the UFOs themselves. He wrote an article on "Lung Mei and the Dragon Paths of England" for a September 1967 issue of "Image" magazine, in which he compared British ley-lines to the Chinese mythological idea of "lung mei" lines, arguing that this was evidence of a widespread pre-Christian dragon cult in ancient Britain. He built on these ideas for "The View Over Atlantis", a book which he privately published in 1969, with a republication following three years later. Believing this earth energy to be a real magnetic phenomenon arising naturally from the ground, Michell argued that an ancient religious-scientific elite had traveled the world constructing the lines and various megalithic monuments in order to channel this energy and direct it for the good of humanity. The tone of his work reflected "a fervent religious feeling", describing the existence of an ancient, universal, and true system of belief that was once spread across the ancient world but which had been lost through the degeneracy of subsequent generations. He added however that this ancient knowledge would be revived with the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, allowing for what Michell described as the "rediscovery of access to the divine will".
The Pagan studies scholar Amy Hale stated that "The View Over Atlantis" was "a smash countercultural success", while the historian Ronald Hutton described it as "almost the founding document of the modern earth mysteries movement". Fellow ley-hunter and later biographer Paul Screeton considered it to be a "groundbreaking" work which "re-enchanted the British landscape and empowered a generation to seek out and appreciate the spiritual dimension of the countryside, not least attracting them to reawaken the sleepy town of Glastonbury". 
The book inspired an array of Earth Mysteries publications in the 1970s and 1980s, accompanied by growth in the ley-hunting movement. Among the most prominent works to build on Michell's ideas during this period were Janet and Colin Bord's "Mysterious Britain", which used them in its presentation of a gazetteer of ancient sites, and Paul Screeton's "Quicksilver Heritage", which argued that the Neolithic had been a time devoted to spiritual endeavours which had been corrupted by the emergence of metal technologies. Michell associated with many individuals active in this ley-hunting community, and in July 1971 was one of many attendees at a ley-hunters picnic held at Risbury Camp, the largest outdoor gathering of the movement since 1939.
In May 1969 Michell established a group known as the Research Into Lost Knowledge Organisation (RILKO) with his friends Keith Critchlow and Mary Williams. In conjunction with the Garnstone Press, RILKO founded the Prehistory and Ancient Science Library, a book series that brought out reprints of older works, such as Watkins' "The Old Straight Track" and William Stirling's "The Canon", both of which contained forewords by Michell. Michell also founded a small publishing company of his own, West Country Editions, through which he brought out his own "A Little History of Bladud" in 1973 as well as a reprint of Howard C. Levis's 1919 book "Bladud of Bath". With his friend John "Peewee" Michael, who lived in Bristol, Michell also established a second small press, Pentacle Books, although it failed to become a commercial success and was short lived.
Michell was involved in the summer 1971 Glastonbury Fayre music festival near Pilton, Somerset, where the pyramid stage was built to Michell's specifications and situated at what he claimed were the apex of two ley lines. Through Michael Rainey, Michell was introduced to the members of rock band The Rolling Stones at the Courtfield Road home of band member Brian Jones. Michell befriended the band's lead singer, Mick Jagger, and he accompanied the band on a visit to Stonehenge. Michell then went on a visit to Woolhope in Herefordshire with Keith Richards, Anita Pallenberg, Christopher Gibbs, and the filmmaker Kenneth Anger, where they hunted for ley lines and UFOs. Marianne Faithfull later recounted that band member Jones was particularly interested in Michell's ideas. He would later meet with the members of The Grateful Dead on their 1972 European tour; band members Phil Lesh and Jerry Garcia expressed an interest in Michell's Earth Mysteries ideas.
Michell's impact on the hippie subculture was recognised by mainstream media, and he was invited to submit an article titled "Flying saucers" to "The Listener" in May 1968, which was accompanied by a critical piece by editor Karl Miller, in which Michell was described as "less a hippy, perhaps, than a hippy's counsellor, one of their junior Merlins."
Hale noted that Michell promoted the idea of "England as a site of spiritual redemption in the New Age", bringing together "popular ideas about sacred geometry, Druids, sacred landscapes, earth energies, Atlantis, and UFOs".
In 1972 Michell published a sequel to "The View Over Atlantis" as "City of Revelation". Shortly after publication he stated that he had written the work in "almost two years of near total solitude and intense study in Bath." This work was more complex than its predecessor, including chapters on sacred geometry, numerology, gematria, and the esoteric concept of the New Jerusalem, and required an understanding of mathematics and Classics to follow its arguments. 
Bob Rickard, founding editor of "Fortean Times", has written that Michell's first three works "provided a synthesis of and a context for all the other weirdness of the era. It’s fair to say that it played a big part in the foundation of "Fortean Times" itself by helping create a readership that wanted more things to think about and a place to discuss them. The overall effect was to help the burgeoning interest in strange phenomena spread out into mainstream culture."
Challenging academic archaeology.
The work of Michell and others in the ley-hunting and Earth mysteries communities were rejected by the professional archaeological establishment, with the prominent British archaeologist Glyn Daniel denouncing what he perceived as the "lunatic fringe". In turn, Michell was hostile to professional and academic archaeologists, accusing them of "treasure hunting and grave robbery" and viewing them as representations of what he interpreted as the evils of modernity. In response to the academic archaeological community's refusal to take the idea of ley lines seriously, in 1970 Michell offered a challenge for professional archaeologists to disprove his ideas regarding the West Peninsula leys. He stated that were he to be proved wrong then he would donate a large sum to charity, but at the time no one took up his offer.
However, in 1983 his case study was analysed by two archaeologists, Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy, as part of their work "Ley Lines in Question", a critical analysis of the evidence for ley-lines. They highlighted that Michell had erroneously included medieval crosses and natural features under his definition of late prehistoric monuments, and that arguments for ley-lines more widely could not be sustained. The impact of their work on the ley-hunting community was substantial, with one section moving in a more fully religious direction by declaring that leys could only be detected by intuition, and the other renouncing a ley line belief in favour of a more ethnographically rooted analysis of linear connections in the landscape. Responding to their work, Michell said that "I just feel sorry for Williamson and Bellamy that the most exciting thing they can find to do with their youth is to discredit the ley vision."
In 1983 Michell published an altered version of his best known work as "The New View Over Atlantis".
Ioan Culianu, a specialist in gnosticism and Renaissance esoteric studies, in a review in 1991 of "The Dimensions of Paradise: The Proportions and Symbolic Numbers in Ancient Cosmology", expressed the view that, "After some deliberation the reader of this book will oscillate between two hypotheses: either that many mysteries of the universe are based on numbers, or that the book's author is a fairly learned crank obsessed with numbers."
In 1970, Michell founded the Anti-Metrification Board to oppose the adoption of the metric system of measurement in the United Kingdom. Believing that the established imperial system of measurement had both ancient and sacred origins, through the Board he brought out a newsletter, "Just Measure". In 1972 he published the first of his "Radical Traditionalist Papers", "A Defence of Sacred Measures", in which he laid out his opposition to the metric system.
In his third Radical Traditionalist Paper, published in 1973, he argued against population control, critiquing the ideas of Thomas Robert Malthus and arguing that correct use of resources could maintain an ever-growing human population.
His fifth Radical Traditionalist Paper, "Concordance to High Monarchists", offered Michell's proposed solution to The Troubles of Northern Ireland; in his view, Ireland should be divided into four provinces, each administered separately but all ultimately pledging allegiance to a High King, in this way mirroring what Michell believed was the socio-political organisation of prehistoric Ireland.
Other publications.
Following the 1975 execution of Michael X for a murder committed in Trinidad, Michell published a souvenir pamphlet to commemorate the execution, claiming that all royalties from its publication would go to Michael X's widow. In 1976 he published "The Hip Pocket Hitler", a book containing those quotations from Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, which Michell deemed to be humorous or insightful, thus seeking to portray a side to Hitler that was more favourable than the dominant paradigm. In 1979 he provided an introduction to a translation of Pliny the Elder's "Inventorum Natura", which had been illustrated by Una Woodruff. That same year he brought out "Simulcra", a work in which he examined perceived faces in natural forms such as trees. In collaboration with Bob Rickard, in 1977 Michell published "Phenomena: A Book of Wonders", an encyclopedic work devoted to paranormal and fortean phenomena which covered such topics as UFOs, werewolves, lake monsters, and spontaneous human combustion. They followed this with a second encyclopedic volume, "Living Wonders: Mysteries and Curiosities of the Animal World", which appeared in 1982 and was devoted to fortean topics involving animals, with much of it focusing on cryptozoological topics.
In 1984 he published "Eccentric Lives and Peculiar Notions", in which he provided brief biographies of various figures whose ideas had been rejected by mainstream scholarship and society, among them Nesta Webster, Iolo Morganwg, Brinsley Trench, and Comyns Beaumont. In "Euphonics: A Poet's Dictionary of Sounds" he then argued that every name represents a "vocal imitation" of the subject that it describes, for instance arguing that "s" appears in the words "snake" and "serpent" because it resembles the curved movement of the animal.
Following the controversy that erupted around Salman Rushdie's 1988 book "The Satanic Verses", Michell published a tract condemning Rushdie, accusing him of deliberately and provocatively insulting Islam. Titled "Rushdie's Insult", Michell later withdrew the publication.
Michell was keenly interested in the crop circle phenomenon, and with Christine Rhone and Richard Adams he established a magazine devoted to the subject in 1990. Initially titled "The Cereologist", some issues would be alternately titled "The Cerealogist", and although Michell initially served as the magazine's editor, he stepped down after the ninth issue, although continued to contribute articles to it. In 1991, he published a book on the subject, "Dowsing the Crop Circles", and in 2001 followed this with a booklet titled "The Face and the Message", which was devoted to a circle depicting the face of a Grey alien which had appeared in Hampshire in August 2001. Despite the longstanding animosity with which Michell held academic archaeology, in 1991 the peer-reviewed archaeological journal "Antiquity" invited him to author a review of a Southbank exhibit, "From Art to Archaeology", which was duly published in the journal.
In the 1980s Michell was a member of the Lindisfarne Association and a teacher at its School of Sacred Architecture. He lectured at the Kairos Foundation, an "educational charity specifically founded to promote the recovery of traditional values in the Arts and Sciences". He was for some years a visiting lecturer at the Prince of Wales' School of Traditional Arts, which had been established by his friend Keith Critchlow. He became a Fellow of the Temenos Academy, a religious organisation which had Traditionalist underpinnings.
Newspaper columnist: 1992–2009.
From January 1992 until his death, Michell published a monthly column, "An Orthodox Voice", in "The Oldie" magazine. He primarily used this as an outlet for condemning the modern world and lambasting what he perceived as the stupidity of most contemporary humans. His first article in this outlet contained an attack on evolution which resulted in a published response from the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. He also used his column to encourage the use of mind-altering drugs, in particular LSD. Two anthologies that collected together some of these "Oldie" columns would be published; the first appeared in 1995 as "An Orthodox Voice" while the second was published in 2005 as "Confessions of a Radical Traditionalist" and contained an introduction from the scholar of esotericism Joscelyn Godwin. During this period, Michell also authored occasional book reviews for the conservative magazine, "The Spectator".
In 1996 Michell published "Who Wrote Shakespeare?", in which he outlined various candidates in the Shakespeare authorship question. "Who Wrote Shakespeare?" received mixed reviews: "Publishers Weekly" was critical, while "The Washington Post" and "The Independent" praised his treatment of the subject. To mark their fiftieth anniversary in 1999, the publisher Thames and Hudson – who had published many of Michell's works – suggested that a biography be written by Michell's friend Paul Screeton. Michell however refused to cooperate with the project, which was abandoned. In 2000, Michell published "The Temple at Jerusalem: A Revelation", in which he outlined his own interpretation of Jerusalem's Old City.
From 2001 to 2004 he contributed several columns to tabloid newspaper "The Mirror" as part of an ongoing series run by the astrologer Jonathan Cainer. Cainer had sought to bring together a range of esotericists to write on related topics, with Michell's fellow contributors including Mark Winter, Patty Greenall, Sarah Sirillan, and Uri Geller. The series came to an end when Cainer left "The Mirror" to work for the rival "Daily Mail".
A keen painter, in 2003 an exhibit of his works was held at the Christopher Gibbs Gallery. In April 2007 Michell married Denise Price, the Archdruidess of the Glastonbury Order of Druids, at a ceremony held in Glastonbury's St Benedict's Church, although their relationship ended several months later. A lifelong smoker, Michell contracted lung cancer, and in his final days he was nursed at his son's home in Poole, Dorset, ultimately dying on 24 April 2009, at the age of 76. His body was buried at St Mary's Church in Stoke Abbott on May Day. A high church memorial service was then held at All Saints' Church in Notting Hill, which was attended by around 400 mourners. 
His work, "How the World is Made" – which he regarded as his "magnum opus" – was published posthumously.
Thought.
Throughout his life, Michell's "views remained relatively static", albeit with some exceptions. He characterised his viewpoint as "Radical Traditionalism", which in his words was a perspective "both idealistic and rooted in common sense".
Michell was a proponent of the Traditionalist school of esoteric thought. Michell was also interested in the writings of Traditionalist philosopher Julius Evola, agreeing in particular with the sentiments expressed in Evola's "Revolt Against the Modern World". He held to the Traditionalist belief in an ancient perennial tradition found across the world, believing that this was passed on by a priesthood in accordance to divine will. He shared the Traditionalist attitude of anti-modernism, believing that modernity had brought about chaos, destruction of the land, and spiritual degradation. He believed that humanity would return to what he perceived as its natural order and enter a Golden Age.
Screeton believed that despite his "obvious acts of liberalism", Michell also had a "right-wing streak", with Hale describing Mitchell as being "quite right-wing in many of his views". She thought it would be "apt" to characterise Mitchell's thought as being "third positionist" in nature.
Angered by the idea of evolution, Michell repeatedly authored articles denouncing it as a false creation myth. Instead he embraced a viewpoint that Screeton referred to as "intelligent design creationism". Accordingly, he was particularly critical of Charles Darwin and Dawkins, lambasting the latter alongside physicist Stephen Hawking as belonging with "the disappointed Marxists, pandering politicians, pettifoggers, grievance-mongers and atheistic bishops who set the tone in modern society." Condemning the scientific community's view of the development of the Earth and humanity, he embraced Richard Milton's claim that the Earth was only 20,000 years old, as well as Rupert Sheldrake's idea regarding "morphogenetic fields", believing that it was these – and not biological evolution – that resulted in changes occurring within species.
Michell's conception of the physical and spiritual worlds was strongly influenced by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. He believed that sacred geometry revealed a universal scheme in the landscape which reflected the structure of the heavens. His views on geometry led him to the belief that pre-industrial societies across the world respected the Earth as a living creature imbued with its own spirit, and that humans then created permanent residences for this spirit.
He also embraced a belief in the tenets of astrology, alchemy, and prophecy, believing that all had been unfairly rejected by the modern world.
Described as an exponent of "British nativist spirituality", he adopted the view of the British-Israelite movement that the British people represented the descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes who are mentioned in the Old Testament. Michell sometimes referred to his approach as "mystic nationalism" and interpreted the island of Britain as being sacred, connecting this attitude to those of William Blake and Lewis Spence. Adopting a millennialist attitude, he believed that in future Britain would be reborn as the New Jerusalem with the coming of a new Golden Age.
He believed that humans really desired to live in a state of extreme order, deeming a societal hierarchy to be natural and inevitable. Generally opposed to democracy, except within small groups in which every person knew the individual being elected, Michell instead believed that communities should be led by a strong leader who personified the solar deity. This embrace of the Divine Right of Kings led him to believe that Queen Elizabeth II should take control of Britain as an authoritarian leader who could intercede between the British people and the divine. He was critical of multiculturalism in Britain, believing that each ethnic or cultural group should live independently in an area segregated from other groups, stating that this would allow a people's traditions to remain vibrant. He did not espouse racial supremacy, with his ideas on this subject instead being similar to the ethnopluralism of Alain de Benoist and other New Right thinkers. He was an opponent of British membership of the European Union and also opposed the UK's transition to the metric system, instead favouring the continued use of imperial measurement, believing that the latter had links to the divine order used by ancient society.
Personal life.
At over six feet in height, Michell was described by biographer and friend Paul Screeton as having "a charismatic personality and imposing presence", being "placidly outgoing and the epitome of gentlemanly charm", and usually appeared "cheerful and optimistic".
In keeping with his upper-class background, he was described as having an "unmistakable patrician hauteur", with "all the self-assurance, impeccable manners and debonair charm of one born to wealth." Screeton described Michell as "gregarious but slightly shy, unassuming but opinionated. Quixotic in behaviour, he was an exemplary host and fastidious and single-minded when embarked upon a project", although also noted that Michell was impatient with those who did not share his Traditionalist beliefs and values.
In keeping with norms within the counter-culture, Michell regularly smoked marijuana, and publicly encouraged the use of mind-altering drugs. His favoured newspaper was "The Telegraph", a right-wing daily. One of his hobbies was woodworking, and he constructed some of the bookshelves in his home. Although he had a strong dislike of computers and advised his readers not to possess a personal computer, in later life he obtained one in order to type up his writings using a word processor. For many years, he lived at 11 Powis Gardens in Notting Hill, North London.
Legacy.
Screeton described Michell as "a countercultural icon", while Hale stated that on his death, Michell left "a rich legacy of publications and cultural influence". At the time he was remembered as "a charming British eccentric and champion of the outsider". His influence was strongly apparent in the British Pagan community, with many British Pagans being familiar with his writings. The archaeologist Adam Stout noted that Michell played "the major role in the 1960s rediscovery" of the work of Alfred Watkins.
Hutton for instance noted that the influence of Michell's ideas could be seen on the Druidic Order of the Pendragon, a Pagan group based in Leicestershire that arose to public attention in 2004. His ideas about dragon energies across the landscape have been incorporated into novels like Judy Allen's 1973 "The Spring of the Mountain" and Cara Louise's 2006 "Annie and the Dragon".
Michell's books received a broadly positive reception amongst the "New Age" and "Earth mysteries" movements and he is credited as perhaps being "the most articulate and influential writer on the subject of leys and alternative studies of the past". Ronald Hutton describes his research as part of an alternative archaeology "quite unacceptable to orthodox scholarship." Accordingly, Screeton noted that during his life, Michell was considered to be "anathema, lunatic fringe, and cranky" by his critics, although he rejected the idea that Michell was a "crank", claiming that such an accusation was "fundamentally mistaken".
Following his death, various aspects of Michell's work have been adopted by thinkers associated with the European New Right and with related right-wing currents in the United States.
Michell's term "Radical Traditionalism", which he espoused in his self-published series of "Radical Traditionalist Papers" in the 1970s and 1980s, would later be taken up as a self-descriptor by Michael Moynihan and Joshua Buckley, the editors of the right-wing journal "Tyr: Myth, Culture and Tradition" from their inaugural 2002 edition onward. The editors of "Tyr" gave the term political overtones which were not present in Michell's original usage of the term. Hale believed that through Radical Traditionalism and the New Right Michell's writings have been brought to "a whole new audience" where they have a "surprisingly different sort of relevance."

Ginés de Mafra

Ginés de Mafra (1493–1546) was a Portuguese or Spanish explorer who sailed with the Magellan expedition in search of a western passage to Asia. His later account of the voyage is an important supplement to the historical record. In 1536 he served as the chief pilot for Pedro de Alvarado on a voyage to Peru and in 1542 he sailed with Ruy López de Villalobos to the Philippines.
History.
Mafra was born in the town of Mafra, north of Lisbon, Portugal, or, according to other sources, in the town of Jérez de la Frontera, in Cadiz, Andalusia. He later became a resident of Palos de la Frontera in southern Spain. In court documents dated August 1527, Mafra stated he was 33 years old, indicating he was probably born around 1493 or 1494. 
Voyage to the Philippine Islands.
In 1519, he became a crew member of the Magellan expedition. Mafra started as a seaman in the galleon "Trinidad", the armada's flagship. In 1521, after many hardships, the expedition reached the Philippines where Magellan was killed in a battle with the islanders. The only remaining ships, the "Victoria" and "Trinidad" (with Mafra still on board) decided to split up and find their own ways home. The Victoria continued west and eventually became the first ship to circumnavigate the globe. Meanwhile, the Trinidad planned to retrace their path across the Pacific but were unable to make much headway and were eventually captured by the Portuguese in the Moluccas.
Mafra and his surviving crewmates were held captive in the Moluccas and then in 1523 transported to Cochin on the east coast of India where most of his companions died from mistreatment and disease. After two more years of imprisonment, Mafra was finally brought by the Portuguese to Lisbon along with Gonzalo Gómez de Espinosa and Hans Bergen.
Upon their arrival in Portugal in 1526, Mafra and his crew members were thrown in prison. Bergen died in jail while Espinosa was later released that year. Mafra himself was detained due to his possession of important documents which included the books and papers from the "Trinidad". The manuscripts included navigational notes of Andrés de San Martín, who was the fleet's chief pilot and astrologer.
These manuscripts were later transferred to Spain during the Iberian Union in 1580-1640. The letters were accessed by several Spanish chroniclers, including Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas. These papers have been lost and now exist only in quotes, references, and citations by these historians.
Finally freed only to find his wife had remarried.
After numerous pleas by Mafra to the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V of Spain to have him released, he was freed in early 1527, and immediately proceeded to Spain. He was given an audience with the emperor after which he went straight to Palos only to discover his wife, Catalina Martínez del Mercado, believing he had died during the voyage, had remarried, and sold their personal fortunes, and land properties. Mafra wrote to the emperor complaining of his marital trouble, and asking for his intercession for the return of his possessions. The emperor agreed, and ordered an investigation be made by officials, and to have the matter resolved.
Expedition to the New World.
Mafra went back to the sea in 1531 and sailed to the Americas. The governor of Guatemala, Pedro de Alvarado, in a letter written on November 20, 1536, told the emperor he had hired the services of Mafra as pilot, who was considered as one of the best sailors due to his experiences with the Magellan voyage. It's not clear where the expedition went but most scholars believe the fleet sailed to Peru.
Villalobos expedition (1542–1546).
In 1542 Mafra joined the expedition of Ruy López de Villalobos as pilot of the "San Juan de Letrán", one of six ships bound for the Philippines. The galleon was separated from the fleet during a severe storm as they sailed between Eniwetok and Ulithi. While stranded in one of those islands, he wrote an account of the Magellan voyage and discussed meeting Rajah Siaiu, chieftain of Mazaua. Mafra wrote, "This same chief [Rajah Siaiu] we saw in the year 1543 by those of us in the fleet of general Ruy López de Villalobos, and he still remembered Magellan, and displayed to us some of the things he [Magellan] had given him." According to historian Antonio Pigafetta, "Magellan's gift consisted of a garment of red and yellow cloth made in the Turkish fashion, a red cap, knives, and mirrors". 
Mafra and his crew members stayed on the island for about 5–6 months. There Mafra, age 53, elected to stay together with 29 other crew members. The other survivors sailed for Lisbon in a Portuguese ship. Mafra handed his manuscript to an unnamed sailor. This eventually reached Spain after having been transcribed by an unknown editor, where it remained unnoticed for many centuries in Madrid's Archive of the Indies. It was eventually discovered and published in 1920.
Assessment of Mafra's document.
Mafra's document has been examined by American geographer Donald D. Brand. Brand dismissed it as nothing more than what Mafra recalled on Andrés de San Martín writings, which Mafra had with him until these were confiscated in Lisbon. "It should be pointed out here that the previously unknown, "Description de los reinos, Libro que trata del descubrimiento y principio del estrecho que se llama de Magallanes, por Ginés de Mafra", published in Madrid, 1920 in "Tres Relaciones" could not be based on more than Mafra's memory of what he might have read in a Tratado begun by San Martín." This dismissive charge unargued, and unproved, was echoed by Martín Torodash, and Philippine religious historian John N. Schumacher, and influenced the thinking of many other scholars.

Egbert Xavier Kelly

Brother Egbert Xavier Kelly, F.S.C. (1894–1945) was an Irish De La Salle Brother who was last assigned to the De La Salle Brothers in the Philippines and was kidnapped and then murdered by the retreating Japanese Imperial Forces at the De La Salle College, of which he was President, during the Allied Liberation of Manila during World War II.
Early life.
He was born William Kelly on 4 March 1894 in County Wicklow, Ireland. During his youth decided to become a De La Salle brother and went to the Christian Brothers Retreat in Castletown to test his vocation. He was then admitted to the novitiate and became a member of the Institute.
Assignment to the Philippines.
In 1911 Kelly was assigned to the Christian Brothers District of Penang. During his trip, he went for a brief stay in Colombo, Ceylon after which he proceeded to De La Salle College in Manila in 1912, after the request of its inaugural president Bro. Blimond Pierre. He began teaching in the grade school department until he was tasked to teach in the high school department.
Assignment to Belgium.
Kelly was selected by the Christian Brothers Superiors to help in the establishment of a Second Novitiate at the General Motherhouse in Lebecq-les-Hal, Belgium. This assignment was completed in 1930.
Return to the Philippines.
Upon the completion of his assignment to the Motherhouse, Brother Xavier returned to Asia to teach for three years in Rangoon, Burma, and another three years in Hong Kong. In 1935, he was reassigned to Manila and was appointed President of De La Salle College in 1937.
Kelly's first six years as President was spent in expanding the facilities of the College. A large classroom wing was constructed at the north end of St. La Salle Hall and a new chapel was constructed at its south end. This chapel was considered the most beautiful in the Philippines and had few rivals in the District, although the Brothers would regret about the chapel's limited size. The chapel was dedicated in 1940 and was large enough to accommodate the school's entire student body, which was then 1,200. On February 2, 1941, he became the founding treasurer and member of the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP), together with co-founders Sister May Caritas, O.P. and the Manila Vicar-General Rev. Msgr. Jose Jovellanos from Tondo as its inaugural President, under the blessing of Irish compatriot Archbishop Michael J. O'Doherty, D.D.
World War II.
Kelly was the President of De La Salle College in Manila when the Japanese army invaded the Philippines on 8 December 1941.
In January 1942, Japanese troops forcibly entered De La Salle College and began to occupy all but a small portion of the building. The Irish Brothers were left to the chapel and a few small rooms while the American De La Salle Christian Brothers were interned, first in a retreat house of the Society of Jesus at Santa Ana, Manila, and then in a Spanish hospital in San Pedro, Makati. They were later put in a Japanese concentration camp in Los Baños, Laguna, until they were rescued and freed together with their other fellow clergy-prisoners by the American Forces under General Douglas MacArthur in February 1945.
The other De La Salle Christian Brothers on the De La Salle Taft Campus, including Kelly, were not imprisoned by the Japanese at the start of the Japanese Occupation and permitted to stay on the De La Salle campus on Taft Avenue.
On 10 February 1945, a Japanese detail forcibly took Kelly and separated him from the others in the building. He was never seen again and his body was never recovered.
Kelly, plus the other 16 De La Salle Christian Brothers soon murdered by the Japanese inside De La Salle College in February 1945, are now honored with an elegant marble plaque at the entrance of the De La Salle Main Chapel.
Beatification.
The Congregation for the Causes of Saints has preserved the cause of Bro. Kelly, and it has applied for the decree of "nihil obstat" for Bro. Kelly, in order for him to receive the title of "Servant of God" by the Holy See.

List of raids

A military raid is a mission where the main objective is to demoralize, destroy valuable enemy installations, free prisoners, gather intelligence, or capture or kill specific personnel. This contrasts to regular military operations where the end goal is to capture territory and advance. Raids are a quick attack, relying heavily on the element of surprise to achieve their objective. After the success or failure of the mission, the raiding force will attempt to retreat to friendly territory before the enemy is able to co-ordinate a counterattack.
Raids are favored by guerrilla, irregular, or special forces. Due to the disproportional affect that a raid can have on an enemy, relative to the attacker's strength and the duration of the attack, raids are a favored tactic in irregular warfare.
This article contains a list of military raids, not including air raids, sorted by the date at which they started:

William White (conscientious objector)

William "Bill" White was a Sydney school teacher during the Vietnam War. In July 1966, White defied a notice to report for duty at an army induction centre. White was the first Australian to be a public conscientious objector to the Vietnam War. Both this initial application for total exemption and subsequent appeals were rejected. White was removed from his classroom and ordered to report to Army quarters at Watsons Bay. He refused to comply and waited at home for the authorities to make the next move.
This standoff lasted for several days and gained wide press coverage causing considerable embarrassment for the Australian Government. The standoff ended when White was dragged from his home after refusing to comply with an order to enter the army. A photo of this event became a potent symbol of the nature of conscription.
He was jailed just before the 1966 election, and continued to seek conscientious objector status until he eventually succeeded on 23 December 1966.
White's main objection was that he felt he was being asked to kill other human beings. However, he also had objections to the war itself and to conscription.
Quote.
It was these words that contributed to the memorable Moratorium Marches of 1970.

Constable Hook

Constable Hook is a cape on the north side of the outlet of Kill van Kull into Upper New York Bay in Bayonne, New Jersey.
The cape has long been an important site of marine transfer operations in the Port of New York and New Jersey. Just offshore, Robbins Reef Light guides harbor traffic. Since the late 20th century, brownfields have been repurposed for recreational and commercial uses.
Historically, the name Constable Hook was used more broadly, synonymous with Bergen Point as defining the southern extent of Bergen Neck and of Bergen Township when established in 1693. On March 15, 1861, the New Jersey Legislature approved unification of Constable Hook along with Bergen Point, Centerville, and Salterville into the Township of Bayonne. Three weeks later, the Charter for the City of Bayonne was signed by Governor Charles S. Olden.
History.
Van Buskirk family.
In 1646, the Dutch West India Company, under the leadership of Director-General William Kieft, gave a land grant to Jacob Jacobsen Roy, a chief gunner or constable in Fort Amsterdam in New Amsterdam. the capital of New Netherland. The area, "Konstapel's Hoeck" in Dutch, takes its name from Roy's title. Roy never cultivated or settled on the land.
The first settler is believed to be Pieter Van Buskirk (Boskerck). Born around January 1, 1665, Van Buskirk built a stone house overlooking Upper New York Bay on Constable Hook at what became known as Van Buskirk's Point around the year 1700. Van Buskirk started a small family cemetery next to his house in 1736. His wife, Tryntje died on October 31 of that year and was buried in the cemetery. Pieter Van Buskirk died two years later on July 20, 1738 and was also buried in the cemetery.
In 1798, Van Buskirk descendants sold a portion of Constable Hook to the Hazard Powder Co. that built a factory and dock. During the War of 1812, the Hazard Powder Co. factory produced gunpowder for the U.S. Navy and for fortifications in and around New York harbor.
In 1854 James J. Van Buskirk (1791–1856), wrote a will and mentioned of his land situated at Constable Hook off East 22 Street was to be reserved for a cemetery. The cemetery was not opened until December 1854 and plots in the cemetery were sold soon after. The official name of the cemetery is not known, but it was often referred to in documents as "Hook Cemetery", "Bayonne Cemetery", "Constable Hook", and is known as the "Bayonne Constable Hook Cemetery". The remaining parts of the cemetery underwent a restoration project of the 1980s. It is surrounded by property owned by IMTT and is also maintained by the company.
Port Johnston.
The industrial Port Johnson area is located in the southwestern portion of Constable Hook. In 1864, after building a railroad bridge over Newark Bay, the Central Railroad of New Jersey laid railroad tracks through Bayonne into Constable Hook. After the American Civil War, they built the Port Johnston Coal Docks, at the time the largest coal port in the world. Many Irish immigrants took jobs with the railroad living in Constable Hook. So many Irish had moved there that the residents of Bayonne referred to the area as "Irishtown." On July 26, 1877, the first full scale strike occurred in Bayonne at the Port Johnston Coal Docks when workers walked off the job. Port Johnston was the site of a prisoner-of-war camp for Italian soldiers during WW2.
Refineries and tank farm-liquid storage.
In 1872, John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil bought 176 acres of land on Constable Hook, and by 1885 there was a pipeline connecting it to the field of Texas. Three years later, Prentice Oil Company was also established at Constable Hook. This company was later sold to a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad called Empire Transportation Company, a competitor of Standard Oil. Other oil companies like Tidewater and Ocean Oil also built refineries on Constable Hook. The oil companies attracted Hungarian, Czech and Slovakian immigrants from Eastern Europe.
The Van Buskirk farmhouse was demolished in 1906 by the Standard Oil Company, which owned the land and were expanding their refinery. Standard Oil has now refurbished the cemetery.
On July 4, 1900, a fire broke out in the Standard Oil refinery. It started when lightning caused a number of the large oil tanks to explode. Flaming oil spread out into New York Bay. It took three days to extinguish the fire that in the end caused $2.5 million in damages yet only nine injuries.
During the Bayonne refinery strikes of 1915–1916 workers at the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey went on strike over wages and union organization. Bayonne police battled the strikers causing the death of one striker. A week later, on July 22, a riot broke out as gunfire would take the lives of four more men, one as young as 19, and injuring many others, one as young as twelve. A second strike would occur the following year. On October 10, a riot broke out that left three policeman and several strikes injured. As the riots continued in the streets, police and strikers traded gunfire and one woman was killed. The strike ended on October 19 as the strikers returned to work and Standard Oil agreed to give everyone a raise.
The facilities of IMTT are located at the southeastern portion of the hook. and were sold it to Macquarie Infrastructure Company in 2014.
Exxon is responsible for clean-up of environmental damage caused by oil facilities, and has been the subject of extended litigation. As of 2015, Exxon has completed a soil investigation at the 324-acre terminal. It has until May 7, 2016, to finish its groundwater investigation under a bill passed unanimously by the New Jersey Legislature in late 2013 that gave polluters a deadline extension on investigating cleanups. according to the NJ DEP, clean-up at Constable Hook has included excavation, stabilization, capping, and the capturing of ground water contamination and installation of steel wall containment systems. The controversial ExxonMobil-New Jersey environmental contamination settlement was made during the governorship of Chris Christie.
Redevelopment projects.
Most of eastern Constable Hook was the 20th century Bayonne city dump, and now belongs to the Bayonne Golf Club, including a recreated lighthouse on the highest hill on the cape, serving as its clubhouse. The north end has South Cove Commons, a late 20th-century shopping mall off Route 440, and a public shoreside nature walk east of there, affording views of tidal mudflats, the former Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne, and New York Harbor. The Hudson River Waterfront Walkway runs along the northern shore of the cape. The Bayonne Energy Center opened in 2012.

Badin Hall (University of Notre Dame)

Badin Hall is one of the 32 Residence Halls on the campus of the University of Notre Dame and one of the 14 female dorms. The smallest residence hall on campus, it is located on South Quad, between Howard Hall and the Coleman-Morse center. It was built in 1897 and hosted the Manual Labor School until 1917 before being converted into a men's dorm. During World War II, it was part of the United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School, and in 1972 it became one of the first two residence halls at Notre Dame to host women.
Badin Hall is listed as an historic structure in the National Register of Historic Places listing. When it was built in 1897, it was the first Catholic trade school in the United States. It is an example of Second Empire architecture. It was named after Fr. Stephen Badin, the first priest ordained in the US and provider of the land where the original Log Cabin was built. Notable alumni include Father Theodore Hesburgh and multiple Heisman Trophy winners. Today, it hosts 121 female undergrads, who are known as the Badin Bullfrogs.
History.
Construction and years as Manual Labor School.
Before the Main Building at the university burned down in the great fire of 1879, it hosted a Manual Labor School (founded in 1843), that was then moved after the fire to a location near currently Walsh Hall. It was the first Catholic trade school in the United States. The Manual Labor School had obtained its charter in 1844, and was under the direction of the Brother of Holy Cross. A few years later, the Manual Labor School was moved on wheels to the present location of Badin Hall. The temporary structure was substituted with brick structure (the one still standing) and renamed St. Joseph Hall, in honor of St. Joseph the Worker, and hosted the St. Joseph's Industrial School' and was opened in November 1897. It was intended to open before the start of the school year, but it did not happen because of a delay in construction. The first floor contained private rooms, a reading room, and a refectory while the second floor contained classrooms, a study hall, and rooms for prefects. A wide staircase led to the third floor, that was used entirely as dormitory. The first director of the new St. Joseph Hall was Rev. Gallagher, who arranged improvements to the rooms and set up a chapel where Mass was said. He provided newspapers and magazines for the boy's free moments. Once enrolled, young men ages 12 to 16 trained to be blacksmiths, bricklayers, carpenters, farmers, and tailors. The goods produced were used by University personnel, and some were sold in South Bend shops.
University dormitory.
Due to the conversion from a profitable institution to non-profit with an academic focus, the Manual Labor School was abolished and St. Joseph Hall was converted to a men's university dormitory in 1917. It underwent major expansion, including two wings that were added at the cost of $20,000, and it was renamed Badin Hall, in honor of Rev. Stephen Badin. Stephen Badin was the first priest ordained in the United States, and was the previous owner of the land on which the university was built. It was opened to seventy freshmen, with the plan of building future wings to host more. A modernized cafeteria was placed in one of the wings of the building. It was the first restaurant on the campus of Notre Dame, breaking a 75 year long tradition of all student eating in the school refectory.
The first rector of Badin Hall was Rev. Fr. Francis McGarry, followed by Florian Flynn. Badin Hall is shaped like an H, is three stories high, and it built of yellow brick and has steep roofs over classical architectural elements, although it has also some elements on the neo-gothic style that prevails in the rest of South Quad. From the very beginning, the men of Badin Hall organized in interhall sports, a trademark activity of Notre Dame students. In the late 1920s, its basement hosted engineering classes before Cushing Hall was built. In 1923, Hugh O'Donnell became rector. In 1931, the university bookstore, previously located in Main Building, was relocated to the south half of the lower floor of Badin Hall, a space that had undergone a variety of uses; first it was a refectory, then a classroom, and then a recreation room for the members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.
The Navy period.
In 1942, Badin Hall hosted officers, recruits and midshipmen that came to campus to train as part of the United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School. At its beginning in April 1942, the school hosted a 30-indoctrination program for new officers, but it became a full-fledged Midshipmen School in October 1942, and hosted ten four-month courses and more than 10,000 officers. This provided the Navy with space and resources for training, while it helped the university recover from the loss in income and enrollment due to World War II. The midshipman school ended in November 1945, and Badin was returned to civilian student use. When veterans returned to campus after the war, the vast majority were accommodated in Badin. In the late 1940s, when Hesburgh served as a prefect on the third floor, the hall was decrepit. Students would sneak out of Badin Hall at night by stealthy using the fire-escape ladder.
Later years.
In 1947, the Hall celebrated its 50th anniversary, with a ceremony featuring the university president. In 1972, Badin become one of the first two residence halls (the other being Walsh Hall) to be converted as a women's dormitory following the acceptance of women into the university. Renovations for the transition to a woman's dorm included increased storage facilities and more washing and drying equipment. The first rector of Badin as a women's hall was Kathleen Ceranksi. Badin celebrated its centenary in 1997, with events including a speech about his time in the Hall by former resident Fr. Edward Malloy. In 1998 the mascot changed from Badin Attitude to the Badin Bullfrogs. In 2003, Badin won the interhall football championship. Badin became the first residence hall in Notre Dame history to win overall Hall of the Year in consecutive years, winning the prestigious award consecutively in 2010, 2011, and 2012. In 2011, Badin's first floor was renovated to house students for the first time in the hall's history. Badin was extensively renovated in the 2017-2018 year, with air-conditioned lounges and kitchens on every floor, and a larger gym. Renovations included a new chapel, since the original industrial building did not include an apt space; the money was donated by Peter and Nancy Baranay. The chapel features stained glass windows from the early 20th century, donated by alumni Charles Hayes and Jon Ritten and originally designed by Franz Xaver Zettler in Munich, Germany, and restored from an old Chicago convent. The renovated chapel was built in "Notre Dame brick", as the main building itself was, that was rescued from the demolition of Brownson and Corby Halls. The residents of Badin Hall moved to Pangborn Hall for the year.
Description.
Badin hall is built in Second Empire Architecture. The hall is H-shaped, with the central portion with a slated roof while the two lateral wings have a mansard roof atop of classical cornices. It is built in yellow brick, three story high, and features a large porch and a balcony on the eastern side. The first floor is entirely dedicated to social spaces (including the new chapel), while the upper floors house the student rooms. Badin is mostly composed of single rooms, and is the smallest of the women's dorms.
Traditions.
Notre Dame has an undergraduate hall system based on the residential college system. Each hall has its own traditions, mascot, colors, sport teams, events, dances and reputation. The Coat of arms of Badin Hall features a frog, the symbol of Badin, while the plier represent the Manual School of St Joseph, which occupied Badin Hall, and the palm leaf represents St. Stephen, the patron saint of Stephen Badin and to whom the chapel is dedicated. Badin Hall residents generally make up a very tight-knit community due to the small number of residents. Annual events have included the Badin Breakdown, a large scale karaoke event on South Quad, and the Polar Bear Plunge. Badin Hall also runs an annual event called "Walk a Mile in Her Shoes", in which a race is held for students wearing high heels to raise money and awareness for St. Margaret's house in South Bend. Throughout the 2000s, Badin was well known as the most frequent champions of Fisher Hall’s annual event, the Fisher Regatta.
During the annual hall photo, senior students stand on the balcony (referred to as the "Badin Terrace" ), with younger students standing in front of the hall below. Graduates participate in the traditional “Porch Picture” in their cap and gowns, which they often recreate when returning to campus in future years for reunions. Badin Hall supports the Hope for Nepal charity, which is an initiative that serves Nepal in several ways, including the operation of an orphanage for children who would otherwise be forced to live on the streets. Other events put on by the hall include "A Conscious Christmas" in the winter and the "Polar Bear Plunge" each February in order to raise money for their South Bend charity partner: St. Margaret's House. During the 1960s, a fictional ghost named Harry Hunter was said to inhabit the first floor of the building.

Penelope Houston (film critic)

Penelope Houston (9 September 1927 – 26 October 2015) was an English film critic and journal editor. She edited "Sight &amp; Sound" for almost 35 years.
Biography.
Born in Kensington, London, she was the daughter of Duncan McNeill Houston and his wife Eilean (née Marlowe). Her father was a rubber broker, while her maternal grandfather was Thomas Marlowe, an early editor of the "Daily Mail". She attended Wimbledon High School, before winning a scholarship to Roedean School, near Brighton; the school was evacuated to the Lake District during the war.
In 1947, she was the first editor of the short-lived film journal "Sequence" founded by Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz and Gavin Lambert at Oxford University, where she read modern history at Somerville College, and graduated from Oxford with a double first in 1949. For a year, she worked in Whitehall on research into the history of the Second World War.
In 1950, she joined "Sight &amp; Sound", the journal of the British Film Institute, as Lambert's assistant. During this early period, she was involved around 1952 with initiating the feature for which the magazine remains best known, the critics' decade poll for the 10 best films ever made. Houston did not create the feature, which she described in September 1962 as an "impossible but intriguing game", but she was responsible for its high profile.
Houston became the editor of "Sight &amp; Sound", then a quarterly journal, in 1956 after Lambert departed for a career as a Hollywood screenwriter. She remained in the post until 1990. At the same time, she was a regular contributor to the "Monthly Film Bulletin" for many years until the mid-1970s. (The two magazines merged shortly after Houston retired). In the late 1960s and early 1970s she oversaw publication of the BFI's "Cinema One" book series. She also had a period as a film critic for "The Spectator", deputised for "The Times" critic and for "The Observer" as C. A. Lejeune's deputy in 1957. She also wrote for "The Observer" and, occasionally, for "The Guardian".
Houston was the author of several books on cinema, including "The Contemporary Cinema" (1963) and "Keepers of the Frame: Film Archives" (1994). She also wrote a short book on a film directed by Alberto Cavalcanti, "Went the Day Well?" (1942).
Houston was an amateur player of golf and a follower of horse racing, on which she gambled. She commented in 2001: "I wouldn’t go into film criticism now if you offered me the top job on a plate. It is so boring. Who wants to spend their days looking at special effects movies from Hollywood made for 15-year-olds?"
Her younger brother, Tom, survived her.

EMD GP49

The EMD GP49 is a 4-axle diesel locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division. Power was provided by an EMD 645F3B 12-cylinder engine which generated . The GP49 was marketed as one of four models in the 50 series introduced in 1979. The 50 series includes GP/SD49 and GP/SD50. Both the GP and SD50 were relatively popular with a total of 278 GP50s and 427 SD50s built. The SD49 was advertised but never built and a total of nine GP49s were built.
Alaska Railroad was the sole customer that ordered the GP49. In two orders, the company first bought locomotives 2801–2804 in September 1983; locomotives 2805-2809 were subsequently built in May 1985. Six GP39Xs were built in November 1980 for the Southern Railway and upgraded to GP49s shortly thereafter.
Performance.
While possessing a fairly high power rating (total of ), the traction horsepower was rated at while was used to run the onboard appliances. The GP49 is known for its slow acceleration, this was due to the radar unit that is mounted under the front pilot to monitor the actual ground speed when the engine is moving to prevent wheel slip. This system is known as EMD's Super Series wheel slip control that was introduced on the GP40X. It tells the engine's computer to slow the speed of the motors to prevent wheel slip. The GP49 is equipped with a 12-645F3B engine with an AR15 alternator rated at 4680 amperes and has four D87 traction motors. Externally the GP49 looks like a GP50 but has two 48" fans above the radiator instead of three as on the GP50, and the engine room has eight access doors on each side under the Dynamic Brake blister for engine and turbocharger maintenance, whereas the GP50 has ten.
Use.
In December 2006, the Alaska Railroad auctioned five units (numbers 2801, 2803, 2804, 2806, and 2807) plus parts; Helm Leasing was the winning bidder with a bid of $1.3 million. The Alaska Railroad's four remaining units (2802, 2805, 2808, and 2809) were still in service as of March 2007. As of July 2014, units 2803, 2806, and 2807 had been acquired by Frontier Rail and assigned to the new Cincinnati East Terminal Railway in Southwestern Ohio.
The units 2805 and 2808 are now part of the fleet of one of the biggest Chilean freight operators, Ferronor and were modified into 6-axle units. They are based out of the Llanos de Soto Workshops of Ferronor S.A, where they operate in Ferronor Vallenar iron ore trains from Los Colorados Mine to the Guacolda Port in Huasco, Chile. Both work with slugs rebuilt from General Electric U9C engines. 2801 and 2802 are now part of the locomotive fleet of TRANSAP, a Chilean railway. They were refitted with A1A bogies, to reduce axle load.
Columbia Rail has four: Columbia-Walla Walla Railway operates four GP49s (2802, 2806, 2807, 2809) on the former Blue Mountain Railroad lines in and around Walla Walla.
Tri-Rail in Florida has since bought Norfolk Southern's six GP49 variants (ex-GP39X units) for use on commuter trains in Florida. The locomotives have since been rebuilt with head end power, low hood also have been de-rated to from . They were also given the designation GP49H-3. As of July 2023, three remain in service and are scheduled to be retired in 2025.

"Our Minnesota" was one of two winners of a 1925 contest to find an additional fight song for the University of Minnesota. Despite the popularity of the Minnesota Rouser, the Minnesota Union offered a hundred-dollar prize for the best college music and lyrics. Marion L. Bassett, a University of Minnesota English major, wrote "Our Minnesota" as part of an assignment for a music class. The judging committee could not decide between Bassett's entry and Truman Rickard's "Minnesota! Let's Go!" (later known as "Minnesota Fight") and split the prize between the two. "Our Minnesota" continues to be performed at Minnesota Golden Gopher athletic events.

Stalag II-D

Stalag II-D Stargard (American named, "Camp #86") was a World War II German Army prisoner-of-war camp located near Stargard, Pomerania. It housed Polish, American, French, Dutch, Belgian, Serbian, Soviet, Italian and Canadian prisoners of war, and Polish civilians.
Camp history.
The camp was established as a temporary camp Dulag L on a military training ground in September 1939 to detain Polish soldiers and civilians taken prisoner during the German September 1939 offensive, which started World War II. For the first few months they lived in the open or in tents during a very cold winter, while they built the wooden and brick huts for the permanent camp. In October 1939 the Dulag L camp was transformed into the Stalag II-D camp. Polish military officers were imprisoned in the camp until December 1939, and Polish civilians until January 1940. Later also other groups of Polish soldiers were held in the camp.
In May and June 1940 American, French, Dutch and Belgian soldiers taken prisoner during the Battle of France arrived. These were followed by Soviet prisoners from Operation Barbarossa in the summer of 1941. In September and October 1943 Italian prisoners arrived after the Italian capitulation. Canadian prisoners from the Dieppe Raid of August 1942 were transferred to Stargard from Stalag VIII-B in January 1944.
Germans introduced racial segregation, and Poles, Africans, Arabs, Jews and Soviet troops were separated from POWs of other nationalities. There were about 4,600 prisoners from Africa, specifically Moroccans, Tunisians and Senegalese, and there was a high mortality rate among them, although from summer 1940 they were gradually transported to other camps located in southern France. Germans carried out medical experiments on the Senegalese. Serbs also faced noticeably more severe treatment. Hundreds of Soviet POWs were deported to concentration camps. Italian POWs were deported to Meppen, to a subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp, in November 1943. Following the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, many Polish civilians, including women and children, were deported to the camp.
The POWs were often used for forced labour in over 1,500 subcamps located in the region. Many died during the work, and were buried near the labour sites.
Late arrivals were Americans, NCOs from the Battle of the Bulge, who left Stalag XIIA Limburg on January 15, 1945, by rail to arrive on January 19, 1945. The camp was liberated by the Soviet Red Army in mid-April 1945.
In 2021–2022, new research was conducted at the site of the former camp, co-financed by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage of Poland. In 2021, a mass grave of dozens of POWs, most of whom died of exhaustion, was discovered. Another mass grave of more than 100 people, including dozens of civilians, even women and children, most likely Poles deported from Warsaw after the Warsaw Uprising, was discovered in 2022.
Living conditions.
The lower ranks prisoners at this camp fared much better than those in many other camps further south. They worked predominately on farms and had the possibility to obtain better nourishment.
Evacuation and dissolution.
The first evacuation occurred on 29 January 1945 in blizzard conditions. The count was held up the morning of the march as the MOC (Man of Confidence) was in negotiation with the Kommandant for the safety of the men who were too sick for the march. Many of the sick and infirmed were left behind in the Lazzarett (camp clinic) and were transported by rail or truck at a later date. Almost a thousand men struggled into formation. There were about five-hundred Russians, two-hundred Frenchmen, one-hundred Americans and twenty-five Canadians in the march. Other reports have the number at as many as two-thousand in the column. They were marched twenty-five or thirty kilometers that day. Then were put into a barn, under guard, and slept for the night. Every evening the guards would dump out the meal for the day on the muddy earth. Everyone would scramble for what they could get. In the morning, they were given two slices of bread, counted, and the march began again for twenty-five or thirty kilometers until they reached the next appointed village. Those who fell to the side of the road were rumored to have been shot, but were more likely to have been loaded onto the “dead cart” at the end of the column used to carry the dead, dying, and sick all piled into the cart together and carried to the next stopping point. After two, maybe three days, the column reached Settin. The sick and the dead were left at Settin while the majority of the rest were moved on to Stalag 2A, Neubrandenburg where they arrived on 7 February 1945. The eight-day total distance of the march was 70–90 miles (120-150 Kilometers).
On 25 February 1945 most of the remaining prisoners were forced to march westward in advance of the Soviet offensive and endured great hardships before they were freed by Allied troops in April 1945.
Escape.
It was relatively easy to escape from a farm, but much more difficult to evade recapture. Prisoners working on farms did not have the essential assistance that was provided in Oflags by teams of dedicated specialists who forged documents and prepared maps. Without these it was extremely difficult to traverse hundreds of miles past frequent checks by the Nazi police.
Gabriel Regnier, a French prisoner, describes his failed attempt with a French companion on 23 March 1942. A Polish civilian worker at the farm had helped them by hiding civilian clothes for them. It was a dark night and they successfully reached a freight train that was switching cars at the station that was close to the farm. They successfully hid in one box-car full of boxes. But then the train stopped in Stettin for unloading, they switched to another car loaded with sacks of barley destined for Aachen in western Germany, which they reached four days later. There again they got out to search for a car going to the Netherlands. Unfortunately the driver of a vehicle noticed two persons moving hesitantly along the train and alerted the military police. Recaptured they were returned to Stargard and spent 24 days in solitary confinement.

Legislative districts of Caloocan

The legislative districts of Caloocan are the representations of the highly urbanized city of Caloocan in the various national legislatures of the Philippines. The city is currently represented in the lower house of the Congress of the Philippines through its first, second, and third congressional districts.
History.
Caloocan was initially represented as part of the at-large district of the province of Manila in the Malolos Congress from 1898 to 1899. The then-town was later incorporated to the province of Rizal, established in 1901, and was represented as part of the first district of Rizal from 1907 to 1941 and from 1945 to 1972. In the disruption caused by the World War II, it was incorporated to the City of Greater Manila and was represented as part of the at-large district of Manila in the National Assembly of the Second Philippine Republic from 1943 to 1944. Caloocan was separated from Rizal on November 7, 1975 by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824 signed by President Ferdinand Marcos, and was represented in the Interim Batasang Pambansa along with other Metropolitan Manila municipalities and cities as part of Region IV from 1978 to 1984.
Caloocan first gained separate representation in 1984, when it elected two assemblymen at-large to the Regular Batasang Pambansa from 1984 to 1986. It was later divided into two districts upon the restoration of the House of Representatives in 1987.
Of the country’s 238 legislative districts, the first legislative district of Caloocan was the biggest in terms of population size, with 1.19 million persons as of 2015.
In 2021, the Senate passed on third and final reading House Bill No. 7700, a bill creating the third legislative district of Caloocan. It divided the first district into two legislative districts. The first legislative district would be composed of Barangays 1 to 4, Barangays 77 to 85 and Barangays 132 to 177 while Barangays 178 to 188 would form the third legislative district. It was later approved by President Rodrigo Duterte on May 26, 2021 as he signed this law under Republic Act No. 11545.

The Minnesota March

“The Minnesota March” is a march for wind band written by John Philip Sousa in 1927 for the University of Minnesota. Sousa received an informal request to compose the march from Minnesota football coach Clarence Spears, and agreed to a request from a committee of university officials in October 1926. Sousa used Indian themes in this march, and later added field drum and bugle parts. The march was published by the Sam Fox Publishing Company and was premiered by Sousa and his band on September 3, 1927 at the Minnesota State Fair. It was first performed at the University of Minnesota the following month, on October 26, by the University of Minnesota Band.
The piece was one of four marches written by Sousa expressly for a university. It is now one of the university's school songs, with lyrics written in 1927 by university band director Michael Jalma. The piece is regularly performed by the University of Minnesota Marching Band and pep bands and often sung by students at various athletic events and ceremonies.
History.
The U of M Marching Band Centennial Book, "Minnesota Hats Off to Thee", published in 1992, described the origins of "The Minnesota March":"The need for a more adequate marching song had long been felt at Minnesota, yet nothing was really done about it until University band director Michael Jalma conceived the idea that John Philip Sousa might be persuaded to provide the music. He apparently confided this idea to football coach Clarence Spears, for the "Minneapolis Tribune" credited Spears for informally making such a request to the famous bandleader. In October 1926, Sousa played an engagement at the old Lyceum Theatre in Minneapolis, and a committee of University officials was formed to wait upon him. It consisted of, in addition to Jalma, E.B. Pierce, Secretary of the General Alumni Association; Carlyle Scott, Professor of Music; and Otto S. Zellner, Associate Professor of Surveying; and a member of the University band's faculty advisory committee."The committee was cordially received by Sousa on October 16 in his suite at the Radisson Hotel, and he readily agreed to the request, though he said he would have to "wait for inspiration" before he could promise a delivery date. He said that the beautiful Indian legendry that formed the background of Minnesota greatly appealed to him and that he was impressed by the very names with which the state abounded, such as Minnehaha, Chippewa, and Minnesota. He hoped to reflect some of this heritage in his composition."
Sousa wrote to E.B. Pierce in March 1927, informing him the composition was nearly complete. On Saturday, September 3, 1927 Sousa and his band premiered the march at the Minnesota State Fair before an "appreciative crowd of 12,000 that packed the grandstand." Sousa described the march as "the best piece I have ever written." However, a disagreement arose after university president Lotus D. Coffman was "asked to accept Sousa’s manuscript of the march on behalf of the university" but refused because "he felt the march should be presented at a university function, not at the state fair." Nonetheless, the dedication ceremony for the march went ahead, and President of the Minnesota State Agricultural Society, William F. Sanger, accepted Sousa's manuscript "on behalf of the State." State fair officials described the fair as "an innocent third party" and stated they only wished to fulfill the personal wishes of Sousa. In his 1964 official history of the state fair, Harry J. Frost wrote that Sousa was "taken aback by the rebuff" but that "the good-natured bandmaster was not offended."
James Davies, music critic of the "Minneapolis Tribune", was present for the march's premiere and gave a strongly positive review; he described it as "vital" and "fine," and stated that it contained "the splendid old rhythmic power" and "reflected more than a passing glimpse of academic life." "The Minnesota March" was first performed on campus by the university band during a song fest in the University of Minnesota Armory on October 26, 1927, receiving enthusiastic applause and an encore performance.
Lyrics.
Michael Jalma, director of the university band—who first conceived the idea of asking Sousa to compose the march—wrote lyrics for "The Minnesota March" which are still used. His lyrics were sung at football games in fall 1927 and are as follows:

Monte-Carlo Television Festival

The Monte-Carlo Television Festival is held every year in June in the Principality of Monaco at the Grimaldi Forum, under the Honorary Presidency of H.S.H. Prince Albert II of Monaco.
The opening ceremony inaugurates each new edition, introducing the jury members overseeing each project in competition. The evening includes a preview screening of a television program.
Open to the public, the festival also offers opportunities to meet international stars, attend TV series "behind the scenes" conferences, public screenings and autograph signing sessions.
The Golden Nymph Awards Ceremony, reveals the winners of the best in TV programming from around the world in front of an audience of more than a thousand guests.
History.
By creating the Festival de Télévision de Monte-Carlo in 1961, Prince Rainier III of Monaco, wished to "encourage a new art form, in the service of peace and understanding between men". Monaco's international status ideally suited the Prince's ambition: to recognize television as an exceptional means of bringing cultures together and enhancing their respective knowledge.
The project generated worldwide interest and, over the years, many distinguished celebrities have sat on the juries, bringing international recognition to the best of television programming. However, the Monte-Carlo Television Festival is above all, since the 1980s, a very important opportunity for business, a huge international market.
Prince Albert II has been the Honorary President of the Festival since 1988.
The best of worldwide television programming has been rewarded with Golden Nymph statuettes, copies of the "Salmacis" nymph by the Monegasque sculptor François Joseph Bosio (1768–1845), chief court sculptor to Louis XVIII, the original of which is on show at the Louvre Museum in Paris.
The Golden Nymph Awards.
The Golden Nymph Awards are among the most prestigious prizes in international television, rewarding the best TV programs and actors. Over the course of the festival, an international jury of leading actors and industry professionals attend screenings of all the programs in competition.
Categories and awards.
Fiction.
The Fiction category is composed of TV series, films and mini series. Six awards are made:
News.
The News category refers to programs that cover international, national, regional and local news or current affairs events. Four awards are made:
Prince Rainier III Special Prize.
This Special Prize was created by Albert II and is given to a programme selected by him. It is awarded to the best documentary dealing with environmental issues. A prize of €10,000 is awarded to the laureate. The award is made in partnership with the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation.
Special prizes.
A selection of special prizes are awarded by partner organisations. The winners are selected from among all of the entries made to the Golden Nymph Awards.

Kneaded eraser

A kneaded eraser, also commonly known as a putty rubber, is a pliable erasing tool used by artists. It is usually made of a grey or white unvulcanized rubber (though it can be found in many different colors, such as green, blue, hot pink, yellow, and so forth) resembling putty or chewing gum. It functions by absorbing and "picking up" graphite and charcoal particles, in addition to carbon, colored pencil, or pastel marks. It neither wears nor leaves residue ("eraser crumbs"), however collect graphite and dust more easily, leading to it more prone to getting darker. They can either be washed or thrown away (typically meaning they last for shorter periods of time than the average eraser).
Kneaded erasers have great plasticity and can be stretched, compressed, split, and molded for precision erasing, pruning lines, cleaning edges, creating highlights through subtractive drawing, or performing other detail work. They can completely remove light marks, but are ill-suited to fully erasing dark areas. They may also smear or stick if too warm. When stretched, some parts of it may detach and fall without remaining attached to either side of the eraser.
Besides their precision, kneaded erasers are preferred by artists for their long life and ease of cleaning. One simply kneads the eraser and the medium will fade into its mass. Although kneaded erasers do not wear away like other erasers, they can become saturated and unable to absorb any more graphite or charcoal. In this case, the eraser will leave marks on the paper instead of removing them. The saturating material can be removed by rinsing and kneading.

2006–07 Sydney FC season

The 2006–07 season is Sydney FC's second season of soccer in Australia. Sydney FC contested in the 2006–07 A-League, and after winning the inaugural A-League Championship in 2005–06, competed in the 2007 AFC Champions League as one of Australia's two representatives.
Review.
Preseason.
After winning the A-League Championship in his first season with the club, head coach Pierre Littbarski signalled his intentions to remain with Sydney FC for the following season in April, whilst the club indicated that an "in-principle agreement" with Littbarski had been finalised. In May 2006 however, it was revealed that Littbarski would not accept an estimated A$250,000 pay cut to his original contract and thus decided to leave Sydney FC. Two months later, Sydney announced that they had agreed to terms with Motherwell F.C. manager and former England international Terry Butcher, who would sign a two-year deal.
During the off-season, Sydney released Andrew Packer from the final year of his contract for him to return to his home state to play for Queensland Roar, whilst signing Alex Brosque (Queensland – 3 years) and Jeremy Brockie (New Zealand – 2 years). 19-year-old Ruben Zadkovich, who was signed as short-term cover for Ufuk Talay late in the 2005–06 season, also upgraded to a two-year full-time contract with Sydney. Matthew Bingley was released from the squad due to salary cap restrictions.
Preseason Challenge Cup.
Group stage.
The group stage of the A-League pre-season cup saw Sydney drawn with Queensland Roar FC, Newcastle United Jets and the New Zealand Knights, whilst in the "bonus round" they would face Perth Glory. Sydney decided to host their two "home" matches during the group stage in Canberra (vs Newcastle) and Wollongong (vs Perth), as well as a match in Campbelltown in the final rounds of the competition. Sydney's first match for 2006–07 was against Queensland, and featured the debut of former Queensland player Alex Brosque, as well as Nikolai Topor-Stanley, a short-term signing to cover injury to defender Jacob Timpano. Brosque scored the winning goal for Sydney against his old club with three minutes remaining. Sydney went to the top of the group with a 2–1 win over Newcastle, Topor-Stanley scoring just three minutes into his debut starting appearance, and the Jets' only goal coming from Sydney player Terry McFlynn. A scoreless draw away to New Zealand sealed Sydney's place in the semi-finals, with the "bonus round" against Perth Glory still to play. Sydney won the match 3–0, picking up two bonus points and easily finishing on top of Group B with 12 points to each other teams' three.
Knockout stages.
Sydney were drawn against Adelaide United, 2nd-placed finishers in group A, in their semi-final, which was held in Wollongong. Adelaide scored first through Travis Dodd, but a goal from David Carney two minutes before half-time levelled the scores. A red card to Alvin Ceccoli for "foul and abusive language" towards referee Mark Shield after the end of the first half left the hosts with ten men for the remainder, and although Sydney managed to create several chances, Adelaide ultimately came out on top with a goal to Kristian Rees in the final minute of the match. The result left Sydney to play-off with Newcastle for third place in the competition.
The 3rd-place playoff was contested in Campbelltown in south-western Sydney. Injuries and representative duties for several of Sydney's regular players handed Terry Butcher the opportunity to give game time to backup goalkeeper Justin Pasfield, as well as trial uncontracted players such as Nikolas Tsattalios, Jason Naidovski and Steven Bozinovski. Goals to Sasho Petrovski and Mark Rudan saw Sydney win the match 2–0 and take third place in the Pre-Season Cup.
Regular season.
Sydney FC's 2006–07 A-League season campaign began with a rematch against their 2005–06 Grand Final opponents, the Central Coast Mariners. Over 19,000 people turned out to see an Iain Fyfe goal seal the contest for Sydney, while goalkeeper kept a clean sheet with two especially excellent saves keeping Sydney in the match. Sydney's following match was the first played at Melbourne's Telstra Dome – a decision made because Melbourne's regular home ground of Olympic Park was unavailable, but allowed an A-League record attendance of almost 40,000 to see the match. After just 13 minutes, Sydney were behind 2–0 to Melbourne, with captain Mark Rudan having been sent off for retaliation. Coach Terry Butcher praised the "spirit" of the Sydney team as they outscored Melbourne for the remainder of the match, but Sydney could not level the scores as Melbourne took the match 3–2. Two days before the Melbourne match it was confirmed that Sydney FC's marquee player Dwight Yorke would be leaving the club for English Championship team Sunderland for a reported £200,000 transfer fee. Whilst Yorke still had one season remaining on his original contract with Sydney, the club were not committed to extending his contract and could not compete with the salary rise offered by Sunderland.
With two draws and a win in their following three matches leaving them sitting in third position after five rounds, Sydney welcomed the arrival of Italian Benito Carbone for a four-match "guest stint". The 35-year-old had an instant impact, setting up goals for Ruben Zadkovich and Sasho Petrovski before scoring one of his own as Sydney ran away 4–1 winners over rivals Adelaide at Hindmarsh Stadium. The performance had Carbone touted as a possible marquee replacement for Dwight Yorke, but a management re-shuffle, which saw chairman Walter Bugno replaced by Edmund Capon and CEO Tim Parker by George Perry, forced Sydney to focus on financial stability in their second season and eventually led to the loss of Carbone. Carbone's final appearance for Sydney, in an away match against the Central Coast, was the first in a string of four consecutive matches in which Sydney scored an early goal but failed to win the match. The run coincided with a large injury list for Sydney, travelling to Newcastle with a squad of just 13 players despite the return of Matthew Bingley on a short-term contract. The return of David Carney, however, saw a 4–0 win over the New Zealand Knights, which sparked a streak of six matches in which Sydney conceded just one goal. This gave Sydney a run of eight matches undefeated heading into the Christmas break, where they sat second on the ladder.
Sydney began the 2007 year well, with a 2–0 away win over the Newcastle Jets on New Year's Day. The result ensured that Sydney retained second position and their one-point margin over Adelaide United on the table despite the deduction of three points due to salary cap breaches. In the following match, against New Zealand, Sydney's run of 542 minutes without conceding a goal came to an end, as did their nine-match unbeaten streak. A 1–0 loss to Adelaide in the penultimate round dropped Sydney to third position, and following Newcastle's 4–0 win over Melbourne in the first match of the final round, left Sydney needing to secure at least a point against Queensland Roar in order to finish in the top four. They did so, earning a 1–1 draw and thus scraping into the finals on goal difference ahead of Queensland.
Salary cap breaches.
It was revealed in late 2004, shortly after the launch of the A-League, that the competition's salary cap rules included unrestricted concessions for "service agreements" – off-field earnings from sponsors to players in return for additional services. Then-chairman Walter Bugno confirmed that Sydney would be including service agreements in players' contracts, but denied that Sydney had contravened any rules regarding salaries whilst speculation mounted that Sydney had already exceeded the salary cap and the FFA announced a zero tolerance policy for breaches in the area. During the 2006–07 season, the FFA announced that Sydney had been found guilty of salary cap breaches regarding the 2005–06 season. Although the FFA would not divulge the nature of the breach, Sydney CEO Tim Parker attributed it to Sydney's unexpectedly heavy schedule which saw them play in the 2005 Oceania Club Championship, 2005 FIFA Club World Championship and the A-League finals series – preventing players from completing the additional services for which they were paid. Sydney were fined $89,000 and penalised one competition point, but the fine was reduced to $44,000 and the point penalty suspended due to the Sydney FC administration's co-operation with FFA investigations.
One month after the initial penalty, in September 2006, it was announced that the FFA would again be investigating alleged discrepancies regarding the contract of a Sydney FC player. The investigation concluded that Sydney had committed multiple breaches of the player contracting regulations: "an undisclosed payment made to a player, pre-payments from the club to players and payments made by the club to agents of the players", all of which should have been, but were not included in Sydney's declaration of player payments for 2005–06. FFA Management assessed that the severity of the breaches warranted a $259,000 fine for Sydney as well as a penalty of three competition points, but this was again reduced in consideration of Sydney's co-operation with the investigation. Sydney's final penalty was a $129,000 fine along with the deduction of three competition points (including the activation of the one point suspended penalty from the earlier breach), with a suspended automatic one point penalty should Sydney be found to be in breach of contracting regulations in 2006–07 or 2007–08. Sydney "reluctantly accepted" the decision and elected not to appeal the penalty, which left them still in second position with three premiership rounds remaining, but their gap back to Adelaide United was reduced to a single point.
Postseason.
Following the completion of the A-League season, Terry Butcher resigned as Sydney FC coach. He was replaced by Branko Culina, who was appointed as interim coach for the club's AFC Champions League campaign on 13 February 2007.
Friendly matches.
As part of Sydney's ACL campaign, a number of friendly matches were arranged against local clubs, and a match against the Malaysian national team. These matches were generally a part of preparations for upcoming ACL matches (as Australian clubs are not playing as regularly as other Asian domestic leagues) and also to build connections with the NSW football community.
Asian Champions League.
As 2005–06 Champions, Sydney qualified for the 2007 AFC Champions League as one of the two teams representing Australia along with 2005–06 League Premiers, Adelaide United. The draw took place in Kuala Lumpur on 22 December 2006. Sydney were placed into Group E along with J.League 2006 Champions Urawa Reds, Chinese Super League 2006 Runners-up Shanghai Shenhua and Liga Indonesia 2005–06 Champions Persik Kediri.
Group matches were played from March to May 2007, each team playing each other at home and away. Sydney made an impressive start, defeating Shanghai away and holding Urawa to a draw at Sydney Football Stadium. A shock loss to Persik in Indonesia was followed up by a 3–0 win in Sydney two weeks later, but disappointing scoreless draws in the final two matches against Shanghai and Urawa meant Sydney finished second in their group and Urawa progressed to the next stage.
Team kit.
Sydney retained playing strip from the previous season, supplied by Reebok, and shirt sponsorship with Healthe continued. The home and away strips were modified for the club's Asian Champions League campaign in early 2007, adding a gold trim for the tournament.

Kashmir stag

The Kashmir stag, also called hangul (), is a subspecies of Central Asian red deer found in dense riverine forests in the valleys and mountains of Jammu and Kashmir and northern Himachal Pradesh in India. In the Kashmir Valley, it is found primarily in the Dachigam National Park and in Tral Wildlife Sanctuary where it receives protection, and elsewhere it is more at risk. In the 1940s, the population was between 3000 and 5000 individuals, but since then habitat destruction, over-grazing by domestic livestock and poaching have reduced population dramatically. Its population is now grown marginally to 289 in 2023 from 197 in 2004. It is the state animal of Jammu and Kashmir. It is the only surviving Asiatic sub-species of the Red deer family. 
Earlier believed to be a subspecies of red deer ("Cervus elaphus"), a number of mitochondrial DNA genetic studies later had the hangul as a part of the Asian clade of the elk ("Cervus canadensis"). The IUCN and American Society of Mammalogists, however, include it in the new grouping of Central Asian red deer ("Cervus hanglu"), with the Kashmir stag being the type subspecies ("Cervus hanglu hanglu").
Appearance.
This deer has a light rump patch without including the tail. Its coat color is brown with a speckling to the hairs. The inner sides of the buttocks are greyish white, followed by a line on the inner sides of the thighs and black on the upper side of the tail. Each antler consists of five tines. The beam is strongly curved inward, while the brow and bez tines are usually close together and above the burr.
Distribution and ecology.
This deer lives in groups of two to 18 individuals in dense riverine forests, high valleys, and mountains of the Kashmir valley and northern Chamba in Himachal Pradesh. In Kashmir, it's found in the Dachigam National Park (and its nearby areas at elevations of 3,035 meters), Rajparian Wildlife Sanctuary, Overa Aru, Sind Valley, and in the forests of Kishtwar &amp; Bhaderwah.
Threats and conservation.
These deer once numbered from about 5,000 animals in the beginning of the 20th century. Unfortunately, they were threatened, due to habitat destruction, over-grazing by domestic livestock, and poaching. This dwindled to as low as 150 animals by 1970. However, the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, along with the IUCN and the WWF prepared a project for the protection of these animals. It became known as Project Hangul. This brought great results and the population increased to over 340 by 1980.
Much of the earlier published material was by the distinguished E. P. Gee, a member of the Bombay Natural History Society. Shortly before the expedition was mounted, Fiona Guinness and Tim Clutton-Brock, both noted deer experts, had visited Kashmir and had gathered some useful field data, which confirmed that Hangul numbers were at a dangerously low level. 
The traditional breeding grounds of the hangul deer is upper danchigam, which is now occupied by Gujar shepherds and their dogs in summer.
The subspecies is battling for its survival in its last bastion: they are now scattered within 141 km2 of the Dachigam National Park located on foothills of Zabarwan range on the outskirts of Srinagar. Known for its magnificent antlers with 11 to 16 points, hangul was once distributed widely in the mountains of Kashmir. During the 1940s, their number was believed to be about 3,000-5,000. In the year 2004 there were 197 (sex ratio of 19 for 100 females and 23 fawns for 100 females) Hanguls which reduced to 153 in 2006 (sex ratio of 21 males for 100 females and 9 fawns for 100 females). As per the census in 2008, only around 160 exist. In 2015, the Hangul population estimation exercise was conducted in which the count of Hanguls in and around their habitats in Kashmir valley is just 186. There are plans to breed them in captivity to increase their chances of survival.
A survey in 2019 conducted by collaring the hangul has revealed that the species is no longer confined within the walls of Dachigam National Park. The endangered subspecies has now begun to use an old migratory route which spread through Sind Valley up to Tulail in Gurez Valley. The corridor was last known to be active in the early 1900s.
Population.
As of 2023, of the 289 Hanguls, 275 are in Dachigam National Park and 14 are in Tral Wildlife Sanctuary, which is considered as the second home of Hangul.

Gao Hongbo

Gao Hongbo (; born January 25, 1966, in Beijing) is a Chinese professional football manager and former player who played as a striker. He previously managed the China national football team from 2009 to 2011, and in 2016. Appointed in May 2009, Gao became the youngest man to take the helm in 30 years. He currently serves as the a vice-chairman of the Chinese Football Association.
Gao was a big name in his professional life as a footballer. Nicknamed Albert Einstein on the pitch, he was a prolific second striker who was famous for his agility in the box and fine ability in finishing. In 1998, he started his coaching career with several Chinese clubs. He was also an assistant of Dutchman Arie Haan in the China national team between 2002 and 2004. Gao made a big achievement as a coach in 2007, as he led Changchun Yatai to take the title of the CSL. In April 2009, he became the head coach of the China national team but was sacked in August 2011 and replaced by José Antonio Camacho. Gao returned as the head coach of the national team in February 2016.
Playing career.
Club career.
Born in a Hui family in Beijing, Gao was discovered and coached by Xu Genbao in the Beijing sports school. A talented youngster he would then join the Beijing Youth Football Team in 1981 where after several years he would be promoted to the senior Beijing team (now Beijing Guoan) in 1985. With them he would gradually establish himself within the team, yet it wasn't until Beijing were in the second tier and won promotion in 1990 that Gao Hongbo would rise to prominence. Once in the top tier, his career would flourish and by the early 1990s Gao had become an integral member within the team where he would personally win the golden ball and golden boot award despite not winning a major trophy. In 1994, he left the team to play in Singapore for Tiong Bahru CSC citing the difficulty to pass the physical standard test of the Chinese Football Association.
After winning the best scorer in Singapore's FAS Premier League with Tiong Bahru in 1994, Gao Hongbo would return to the newly formed fully professional Beijing Guoan club and would immediately make in impact when he scored 21 times in the following two years. After winning the Chinese FA Cup in 1996, he left Beijing Guoan and would join Guangzhou Songri in the second tier where he would reteam with previous coach Xu Genbao and help the club win promotion to the top tier in 1997 when he led the league in scoring with 18 goals. Already offered an assistant coach position at the club before the 1998 league season he would officially retire from playing when the season finished.
International career.
He would make his senior debut on April 4, 1992, as a substitute in a friendly against USA in a game where China lost 5–0 to achieve their biggest recorded defeat. Despite the defeat he would still be included in the squad that took part in qualification for the 1992 AFC Asian Cup where he even scored his debut goal against Malaysia on April 23, 1992. When China qualified he would be included in the squad that would come third in the tournament, however it was in the 1994 qualification process for the World Cup that saw Gao Hongbo establish himself as a prominent member of the Chinese squad but despite his best efforts he was unable to help them qualify. After several years out of the team, new manager Bobby Houghton would bring Gao back in to play several friendlies and a World Cup Qualifier against Vietnam that China won 3–1 on May 25, 1997, which was to be his last game before he retired.
Management career.
Guangzhou Songri.
Xu Genbao would appoint Gao Hongbo as his assistant player coach when he signed him in the 1997 league season before he left the team to coach the defending champions Dalian Wanda. The next season saw him replaced by Edson Tavares and Gao remain as his assistant; however, Aristeu Tavares left Guangzhou Songri at the end of the 1998 league season and Gao Hongbo went on to succeed him as the head coach of the team at the beginning of the 1999 league season at the age of 33. He would, however quickly run into trouble with his players and would leave the club after only 11 matches despite having a decent start to the season and he would go abroad to study coaching. He studied in several clubs in London and Southampton, and his long-time teammate Yang Chen invited him to study in Germany as well.
China U-17.
After several months of studying, Gao Hongbo was appointed the coach of the national U-17 team. Although the team eliminated South Korea despite Koreaphobia and qualified from group stage in the AFC U-17 Championship 2000, the 1–7 defeat to Japan essentially ended his job.
After the game, Gao Hongbo resigned from the national post and returned to help Xu Genbao in coaching Shanghai Zhongyuan. This duo again won the promotion to Jia A and left the club together in 2002.
Gao Hongbo worked as an assistant coach in the national team between 2003 and 2004. After Wu Jingui, the coach of the new champion Shanghai Shenhua, was introduced to the national team, he left the team to coach Xiamen Hongshi.
Xiamen Hongshi.
Gao Hongbo's career in Xiamen was a surprising success and he was able to transform Xiamen Hongshi into potential promotion contenders when he was able to take them to third within 2004 second tier. The following season would see them actually win the table and promotion into the 2005 Chinese Super League.
Changchun Yatai.
He led Changchun Yatai as League Champions in 2007. Gao was dismissed by Changchun in 2008 as the club struggled to repeat their form of the previous season.
China.
On April 16, 2009, Gao signed a contract as Head Coach from the China national football team. Serbian Vladimir Petrovic was the last full-time coach but his contract was not renewed after China was eliminated from the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Gao is the first China national team coach that was chosen through an open selection process, which included four other candidates: Wu Jingui (former Shanghai Shenghua coach), Yin Tiesheng (previous temporary caretaker manager) and Shen Xiangfu (under-23 team coach). His arrival saw China opting for a new strategy, turning towards ground passing tactics and adopting the 4–2–3–1 formation. It was noted that Chinese footballers had relied too heavily on the long balls and header strategy for almost a decade. Above all, Wei Di, the chief of the Chinese Football Association, stressed that, "Anytime, no matter win or loss, they must show their team spirit and courage. I hope, after one year's effort, the national team can give the public a new image."
In his debut as manager, China drew 1–1 with Germany in Shanghai on May 29, 2009. China defeated Iran 1–0 in a friendly match just three days later. With the two positive results against Germany and Iran, hopes have been raised amongst Chinese fans that Hongbo will lead the national team into a new, more prosperous era.
With the 2010 World Cup qualification passed, Gao was tasked with securing qualification for the 2011 Asian Cup.
Under Gao, China were able to gain 13 points in the Asian Cup qualifications for 2011. In January 2010, Gao secured qualification for the 2011 Asia Cup and has set the goal of winning the tournament to be held in January 2011. This led to a revival in interest amongst some Chinese football fans, as China had also won 1–0 against France in June 2010, as well as holding World Cup quarter finalists Paraguay to a 1–1 draw in September 2010. Some of them were even thinking that reaching the semi-finals of the Asian Cup was possible.
In February 2010, he led the national team to win the East Asian Football Championship. China held hosts Japan to a goalless draw before stunning South Korea 3–0 in their first victory over the Koreans. China in their final game won against Hong Kong 2–0.
In January 2011, he led the national team to the 2011 Asian Cup in Qatar. However, after a good opening game victory over Kuwait, China went on to lose to the hosts in their second match. This required them to beat their final opponents Uzbekistan in order to have a chance to move on into the second round. They only managed a 2–2 draw and thus, bowed out of the tournament in the first round. Despite this, they did earn 4 points for their win and draw and given that they had a young team whose average age was 23, this was a promising performance. However, this led to some discontent amongst Chinese fans, plus it also seems that this was the reason that eventually led to the replacement of Gao by the CFA. Although Gao's winning percentage (65%) was the highest for a Chinese manager since Nian Weisi (67.86%), and has not been defeated since the end of the Asian Cup in 2011 (6 wins, 2 draws), this was still not enough to convince the CFA of replacing him. Despite the Chinese Football Federation announcing that Gao would not be fired, after China's Asian Cup exit, on August 13, 2011, he was officially sacked and replaced by José Antonio Camacho, less than a month before the World Cup qualifiers for 2014.
But corruption still remains a problem in Chinese football, and in 2010, Wei admitted that recently, "Chinese football has degraded to an intolerable level. It has hurt the feelings of fans and Chinese people at large," he added that he was confident in being able to aid Chinese men's and women's football return to the leading status in Asia and world respectively in future. Wei pointed out six major problems which had caused the "huge slump" of Chinese football in the past few years, while he dissected the dwindling pool of young player selection as being a big problem along with unhealthy professional leagues affected by gambling and match fixing scandals.
Shaanxi Renhe.
On September 24, 2011, Gao became the head coach of Shaanxi Chanba.
ADO Den Haag.
In September 2015, Gao was appointed as the assistant to manager Henk Fräser at Eredivisie side ADO Den Haag, a Dutch football team owned by Chinese Sports Marketing Company "United Vansen".
China (2nd time).
After Alain Perrin was sacked for China's poor performance at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, Gao volunteered himself to be the next head coach, stating that it was his mission as a football coach to help the national team when it needs help. He was appointed the team's coach on 3 February 2016. In his first two matches, and also China's last matches to qualify for the last round of 2018 FIFA World Cup, Gao Hongbo and the Team Dragon created one of the most miraculous stories in their qualification history. China continued their journey by beating Maldives 4–0 at home; therefore they took the second position back from Hong Kong due to Qatar's 2–0 win over Hong Kong. In the last match, China must win Qatar while waiting North Korea, Jordan, Syria, Oman, the UAE and Iraq (Kuwait is being banned) to fail to defend their positions. China beat Qatar 2–0, and due to Socceroos's 5–1 thrash over Jordan and North Korea's shocking 2–3 loss to the Philippines, China managed to qualify to the last round of the 2018 World Cup qualification in Asian zone, as the last of top four teams. They also earned a ticket to qualify direct to the 2019 AFC Asian Cup held in the UAE. Later, Oman also failed to defend their positions after losing 0–2 to Iran. Gao resigned on October 11, 2016 after losing to Syria 1–0 and Uzbekistan 2–0 respectively in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC third round.

Eisenkappel-Vellach

Eisenkappel-Vellach () is a market town in the Völkermarkt District in the Austrian state of Carinthia. The spa town is the southernmost municipality of Austria, close to the border with Slovenia.
Geography.
The municipal area covers the valley of the Vellach creek, which runs in north–south direction from the heights of the Kamnik-Savinja Alps and the Karavanke range down to the Drava River. The Obir massif in the west contains a large dripstone cave system. Two mountain pass roads lead to Slovenia: the Seebergsattel in the southwest connecting it with Jezersko and the less frequented Pavlič Pass in the southeast on the road to Solčava.
Eisenkappel-Vellach consists of the main locality Bad Eisenkappel and several smaller settlements located in lateral valleys, subdivided into the "Katastralgemeinden" of Bad Vellach ("Bela"), Blasnitzen ("Spodnja Plaznica"), Ebriach ("Obirsko"), Eisenkappel ("Železna Kapla"), Koprein Petzen ("Pod Peco"), Koprein Sonnseite ("Koprivna"), Leppen ("Lepena"), Lobnig ("Lobnik"), Rechberg ("Reberca"), Remschenig ("Remšenik") and Trögern ("Korte").
According to the 2001 census, 38% of the population are Carinthian Slovenes, distributed over the 15 localities as follows: 
History.
The Seeberg Pass was already part of a Roman road in the Noricum province from 15 BC onwards. A "Capella" settlement in the Duchy of Carinthia, named after a chapel (, ) held by the Bishop of Brixen, was first mentioned about 1050. The market was probably established in the early 13th century under the rule of Duke Bernhard von Spanheim. Market rights were officially confirmed in a 1267/68 deed, when the Seebergsattel was an important trade route for salt and iron ore (German: "Eisen"). From the 15th century onwards, the valley was the site of several ironworks. Fortifications were built against the invasions by the Ottoman forces, nevertheless Kappel was devastated in 1473. Emperor Frederick III had the town rebuilt and granted it the present-day coat of arms in 1493.
The Kappel municipality was established in 1850, it was renamed Eisenkappel in 1890, while the iron industries declined. The Eisenkappel citizens had to rely on forestry and summer tourism around several mineral springs, promoted by the opening of the Vellachtalbahn narrow gauge railway line in 1902. Eisenkappel and Vellach finally merged in 1939. In the late days of World War II the remote Peršman farm in Koprein Petzen was a strongpoint of the Slovene Partisans, the only ever-existing Anti-Nazi military resistance of Austria. On 25 April 1945, a Nazi "SS" unit stormed the building killing eleven residents, among them seven children.
Politics.
Seats in the municipal "Gemeinderat" assembly as of March 2019 :
Since March 2009, Eisenkappel-Vellach has been run by a Carinthian Slovene mayor, Franc Jožef Smrtnik. It is currently the only municipality in Carinthia with a mayor of the Slovene minority party Enotna Lista.

Plains and Sierra Miwok

The Plains and Sierra Miwok were once the largest group of California Indian Miwok people, Indigenous to California. Their homeland included regions of the Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley, and the Sierra Nevada.
Geography.
The Plains and Sierra Miwok traditionally lived in the western Sierra Nevada between the Fresno River and Cosumnes River, in the eastern Central Valley of California. As well as in the northern Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta region at the confluences of the Cosumnes River, Mokelumne River, and Sacramento River.
In the present day, many Sierra Miwok live in or close to their traditional territories and Indian rancherias, including at:
Culture.
The Plains and Sierra Miwok lived by hunting and gathering, and lived in small local tribes, without centralized political authority. They are skilled at basketry and continue the traditions today.
Religion.
The original Plains and Sierra Miwok people world view included Shamanism. One form this took was the Kuksu religion that was evident in Central and Northern California, which included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual morning ceremony, puberty rites of passage, shamanic intervention with the spirit world, and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms. Kuksu was shared with other indigenous ethnic groups of Central California, such as the Pomo, Maidu, Ohlone, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts. However, Kroeber observed less "specialized cosmogony" in the Miwok, which he termed one of the "southern Kuksu-dancing groups", in comparison to the Maidu and other northern California tribes.
Traditional narratives.
The record of myths, legends, tales, and histories from the Plains and Sierra Miwok is one of the most extensive in the state. These groups participate in the general cultural pattern of Central California.
Mythology.
Miwok mythology is similar to other natives of Central and Northern California. The Plains and Sierra Miwok believe in animal and human spirits, and see the animal spirits as their ancestors. Coyote is seen as their ancestor and creator god.
Divisions.
There were four definite regional and linguistic sub-divisions: Plains Miwok, Northern Sierra Miwok, Central Sierra Miwok, and Southern Sierra Miwok.
Plains Miwok.
The Plains Miwok inhabited a portion of the Central Valley's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and adjacent plains in modern southern Sacramento County, eastern Solano County, and northern San Joaquin County. They spoke Plains Miwok, a language of the Miwokan branch of the Utian language family.
Villages and local tribes.
Classical anthropologists recorded a number of specific Plains Miwok villages, but it remained for work by Bennyhoff in the 1950s and 1960s to recognize multi-village territorial local tribes as the signature land-use organization of the Plains Miwok. The published specific village locations were:
Among the important landholding local tribes at the time of Spanish colonization in California were:
Post-contact history.
The majority of the members of the Plains Miwok local tribes moved to colonial Franciscan Mission San José, in some cases through attraction and in other cases through intimidation, between 1812 and 1833. By 1815 they represented 14% of the Indian people at that mission, and by 1830 they had reached 42% of the mission's population. In 1834 and 1835, hundreds of Plains Miwok survivors of the Central Valley's 1833 malaria epidemic were baptized at Mission San José. By the end of 1835, Plains Miwok was the native language of 60% of the Indian people at the mission.
Between 1834 and 1838 the Alta California missions were secularized (closed as religious and agricultural communes). Many Plains Miwoks moved back to their home areas, where between 1839 and 1841 John Sutter played the local groups off against one another in order to gain control of the lower Sacramento Valley. Other Plains Miwok families remained in the San Francisco Bay area, intermarried with Ohlone, Patwin, and Yokuts peoples, and found work on local Mexican ranchos.
Northern Sierra Miwok.
The Northern Miwok inhabited the upper watersheds of the Mokelumne River and the Calaveras River. One settlement site is within the present day Indian Grinding Rock State Historic Park near Volcano. They spoke Northern Sierra Miwok, a language in the Utian linguistic group.
Historic villages.
The authenticated Northern Sierra Miwok villages are:
Central Sierra Miwok.
The Central Sierra Miwok inhabited the upper watersheds of the Stanislaus River and the Tuolumne River. They spoke "Central Sierra Miwok", a language in the Utian linguistic group.
Historic villages.
The authenticated Central Sierra Miwok villages are:
Southern Sierra Miwok.
The Southern Miwok inhabited the lower banks of the Merced River and the Chowchilla River, as well as Mariposa Creek. They spoke Southern Sierra Miwok, a language in the Utian linguistic group.
The Merced River flows from the High Sierras, through Yosemite Valley, and into the San Joaquin Valley near present-day near Livingston.
The Mono tribe people (considered Northern Paiute) occupied the higher eastern Sierras and the Mono Lake Basin, and entered Yosemite from the east. The Mono name for the Southern Miwok was "qohsoo?moho." Miwoks occupied the lower western foothills of the Sierras and entered from the west. Disputes between the two tribes were violent, and the residents of the valley, in defense of their territory, were considered to be among the most aggressive of any tribes in the area.
When encountered by immigrants of European descent, the neighboring Southern Sierra Miwok tribe referred to the Yosemite Valley residents as "killers". It is from this reference and a confusion over the word for "grizzly bear" that Bunnell named the valley Yosemite. The native residents called the valley "awahni". Today, there is some debate about the original meaning of the word, since the Southern Miwok language is virtually extinct, but recent Southern Miwok speakers defined it as "place like a gaping mouth." Those living in "awahni" were known as the Awahnichi (also spelled Awani, Ahwahnechee, and similar variants), meaning "people who live in awahni". The naming of the Ahwahnee Hotel was derived from the Miwok word.
Historic villages.
The authenticated Southern Sierra Miwok villages are:
Post-contact history.
After Euro-Americans entered Yosemite Valley and the adjacent Sierras, and established Yosemite National Park, the residents were of both Paiute-Mono and Miwok origin. They had either fought to a stalemate or agreed to peaceful coexistence and had intermixed to a limited extent.
Population.
Alfred L. Kroeber estimated there to be 9,000 Plains and Sierra Miwok combined in 1770, but this is an arguably low estimate. Richard Levy estimated there were 17,800. In 1848 their population was estimated at 6,000, in 1852 at 4,500, in 1880 at 100, and in 1910 the population was estimated at 670.

Pigeon Peak

Pigeon Peak, elevation , is a summit in the Needle Mountains, a subrange of the San Juan Mountains in the southwestern part of the US State of Colorado. It rises dramatically on the east side of the Animas River, west of the fourteener Mount Eolus. It is located in the Weminuche Wilderness, part of the San Juan National Forest.
Pigeon Peak is notable both for its absolute height and for its local relief. It is the 57th highest independent peak in Colorado,
narrowly missing the well-known list of fourteeners. In terms of local relief, it is one of the most impressive peaks in Colorado. Its most dramatic rise is over the Animas River to the west, over which it rises nearly in under . Also, its east face is an cliff.
Climbing.
Since Pigeon Peak is not a fourteener, it sees far less traffic than the nearby trio of Mount Eolus, Windom Peak and Sunlight Peak. The standard route is not technically difficult, but it is long and requires a little-hiked wilderness approach. Climbers typically camp near Ruby Lake north of the peak. From there the route ascends to a saddle between Pigeon Peak and Turret Peak, southwest of Pigeon. The route then descends and makes a traverse around to the opposite side of the peak, finally ascending the northwest slopes. Difficulties involve class 3 scrambling.

Full summer pool

A full summer pool or full pool is the water level of a reservoir at normal operating conditions.
Water levels.
During droughts or water shortages, the water level can drop below full summer pool. Additionally, water levels may be lowered during the winter season below full summer pool to accommodate snowmelt or seasonally heavy rains. 
During periods of heavy rain, the water level in the reservoir may rise above full summer pool to prevent flooding downstream.

Chapel Hill Transit

Chapel Hill Transit operates public bus and van transportation services within the contiguous municipalities of Chapel Hill and Carrboro and the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the southeast corner of Orange County in the Research Triangle metropolitan region of North Carolina. Chapel Hill Transit operates its fixed route system fare free due to a contractual agreement with the two towns and the university to share annual operating and capital costs. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .
History.
In the early 1970s, during the administration of Chapel Hill Mayor Howard Nathaniel Lee, the Public Transportation Study Committee was formed, consisting of representatives from the Towns of Chapel Hill and Carrboro, and UNC. The committee then received a Federal Urban Mass Transit Administration grant to examine the suitability of a permanent transit system. Town voters approved a $350,000 bond referendum for local match for capital and a $.10/$100 valuation ad valorem tax to support transit operations. Chapel Hill Transit began operations in August 1974 as a department of the Town of Chapel Hill government. Prior to Chapel Hill Transit, the UNC Student Government operated a campus shuttle system from 1968 until 1974. The Transit Director reports to the Town Manager, who is responsible to the Town Council. A citizen advisory committee, the Transportation Board, makes recommendations to the Town Council on transportation and traffic issues. A plan adopted by the Town Council in 1977 included a set of transportation goals which specifically encourage transit over automobile use in the central areas of Chapel Hill. Although the transit system is operated by the town of Chapel Hill, Carrboro and UNC are financial partners in the operations. System expenses are allocated based upon population. Carrboro began purchasing transit services in the fiscal year 1977–1978 with revenue sharing funds. In the fall of 1980, Carrboro approved a $.10/$100 valuation ad valorem tax to pay for transit service. In fiscal year 1980–1981 the Carrboro contract first included the EZ Rider.
In 1992, Chapel Hill Transit teamed up with the Triangle Clean Cities Coalition and Ebus, a California company that manufactures electric buses, to demonstrate a 22-passenger bus that promised cleaner air and reduced dependence on foreign fuels. This vehicle demonstration followed an earlier one arranged by the Public Transportation Division of the North Carolina Department of Transportation. In the earlier demonstration, a Transteq hybrid bus was transported from daily use in Denver, Colorado, and made available for test drives on the Chapel Hill Transit lot. In February 2006, K. Stephen Spade, a former Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority employee, was hired as the transportation director for the Town of Chapel Hill. In August 2006, Chapel Hill Transit announced that their buses will be equipped with GPS tracking devices, allowing the bus riders to check the arrival time of the buses using the internet and their cell phone. The project was completed by NextBus Inc. Fourteen bus stops would also have digitized signs showing the estimated arrival times of buses. These signs were controversial, as the cost of installing them was almost $1 million. In September 2006, Chapel Hill Transit announced plans to begin purchasing hybrid buses. The town planned to buy as many as nineteen new buses: three hybrids, several extra-long and the rest standard size. In October 2006, the Chapel Hill Town Council approved the purchase of sixteen new Chapel Hill Transit buses at a cost of $5.8 million from Gillig Corp. Federal grants provided about $5.2 million, and the town provided approximately $600,000 in local funds. Three of these sixteen new buses run on diesel-electric drivetrains. The rest of the buses are mostly powered by Detroit Diesel series 50 engines. The buses, delivered in July 2007, expanded the system and replaced older buses. The town had an additional $1.7 million in federal funding which was sufficient to purchase four 60-foot articulated buses, each with two sections that allow them to flex in the middle. All of the purchased buses were low-floor buses with interior floors at curb level.
Fixed Route Service.
The Chapel Hill Transit system consists of 20 routes, however, during weekends, only 9 routes run. 3 of the weekday routes are considered express routes and are designated with an X. The basic hours of operation are from early morning to evening. Connections to GoTriangle, Orange County Transportation Authority, and PART are available at Manning Drive. Each fixed route vehicle is equipped with a bike rack, which can take two bikes, and Wi-Fi.
A Senior Shuttle route operates weekdays making 7 stops each hour, in a loop, to destinations in Chapel Hill and Carrboro. The Senior Shuttle route uses alternative vehicles to accommodate passengers with restricted mobility.
All fixed routes and special service routes are fare free. The Tar Heel Express charges a $3 one way and $5 round trip fee for rides.
Route List.
Safe Ride Service.
The Safe Ride program is funded by the University of North Carolina to provide safe overnight service while UNC Chapel Hill is in session. It only runs on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. 3 "Safe Ride" routes operate on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday late evenings when the university is in session. They all start in the Varsity Theater in E Franklin Street. 
Tar Heel Express Shuttles.
Chapel Hill Transit operates a "Tar Heel Express" special event shuttle service for UNC Football and Men's Basketball home games, in addition to special events. The shuttles provide continuous and fully accessible service, running every 10 to 15 minutes between the park and rides and Kenan Memorial Stadium or Dean E. Smith Center. Service ends 45 minutes after the game ends.
Paratransit.
A fare free "EZ Rider" paratransit service provides a demand-responsive transit service for the handicapped and elderly that are unable to use the regular fixed route service. The service operates from morning to evening on weekdays and on Saturdays. Advanced reservations and enrollment are required.
Park &amp; Ride.
Chapel Hill Transit operates 3 Park &amp; Ride lots throughout Chapel Hill and Carrboro. Parking fees are $2/day and can be paid using an on-site meter or the Parkmobile app. Monthly and annual permits are available for $21/month and $250/year. The University of North Carolina operates 4 other Park &amp; Ride lots. Permitting for these lots is administered through the university's Commuter Alternatives Program (CAP) Office. UNC's Park &amp; Ride lots are for UNC Employees and Students only; no public/daily parking is available. UNC Park &amp; Ride permits are honored in all Chapel Hill Transit Park &amp; Ride lots.
Bus Rapid Transit.
Chapel Hill Transit is planning to build an 8.2 mile North-South Bus Rapid Transit (NSBRT) to run from the Eubanks Road Park &amp; Ride lot (a northern terminus) and Southern Village (the southern terminus) and points in between. The route follows NC 86 (MLK Jr. Blvd.) from the northern edge of Chapel Hill into downtown, then follows Columbia St through the campus of UNC-Chapel Hill, and continues along US 15-501 to Southern Village. The proposed route is based on the NS route which consistently has the highest ridership of all routes. Projected cost is $96-105.9 million with $50-75 million provided by federal funding, to commence passenger service in 2028 and projected 12,000 daily trips (in 2040) with an annual operating cost of $3.4 million. The NSBRT will run every 8 minutes during peak hours and every 10-20 minutes in off-peak hours. The existing NS bus route is expected to be replaced by the NSBRT. Along most of the corridor, NSBRT will operate in dedicated lanes.

REAPER

REAPER ("Rapid Environment for Audio Production, Engineering, and Recording") is a digital audio workstation, MIDI sequencer, and video editing software application created by Cockos. The current version is available for Microsoft Windows (XP and newer), macOS (10.5 and newer), and Linux. REAPER is capable of processing industry-standard audio and video media formats and is a compatible host for 32-bit and 64-bit plug-in formats such as VST and AU. 
History.
REAPER development is led by Justin Frankel, who also created Winamp and the Gnutella peer-to-peer file sharing network. A preview was released in 2005 and the first official shareware release was in August 2006, with a download size of only 2MB and a "huge feature set, incredibly low price and surface simplicity".
Version 2.0 (October 2007) included a more sophisticated user interface, an extended mixer, and the ability to save and load screen layouts. This update also added the Zplane Elastique 2 algorithms for enhanced time-stretching and pitch shifting, supported Windows and Mac OS, and remained compact enough to run off a USB memory stick.
Version 3 (2009) added nested tracks, plugin controls in the mixer, VCA grouping, and enhanced automation and MIDI features.
Version 4 (2011) continued Cockos' reputation of "listening and involving their user base with frequent updates, beta versions and forum discussion" while adding features such as automatable pitch shift envelopes, multichannel setups such as quad, 5.1, 7.1 and 9.1, improved project management, and window arrangement customization.
Version 5 (2015) added video editing capability, automation of individual effect parameters, enhanced scripting, and VST3 support.
Version 6 (2019) introduced Retina, HiDPI, and Metal display support for higher resolution and faster screen redraw, FX plugin embedding for faster workflow, MIDI CC envelope automation, a graphical patchbay, and performance improvements for projects with 200+ tracks.
Version 7 (2024) added support for track lanes, swipe comping, up to 128 channels of audio per track, and 128 buses for MIDI routing with unlimited audio tracks.
Licensing.
REAPER is proprietary software with several perpetual licensing options that include next major version update rights.
Customization.
REAPER offers a comprehensive range for multi-track recording and editing, MIDI recording and editing, internal non-realtime downmixing, and track-by-track effects looping. The routing concept eliminates the necessity for dedicated bus, aux, and MIDI tracks, allowing each track to accommodate both audio and MIDI data. Multi-track editing is facilitated through object grouping, analogous to the approach employed in Samplitude. Both individual elements and complete tracks can be grouped. The options for macro customization, allowing users to combine complex function sequences into a macro through a drag-and-drop individual commands and assigning them to the user interface, a keyboard key, a mouse button, or a MIDI/OSC command, according to the user's specifications. Furthermore, REAPER offers an extension API that facilitates deep integration of third-party software within the REAPER environment.
The graphical user interface (GUI) of REAPER can be modified according to the user's preferences through the use of customizable themes. These themes can be created by the user themselves, allowing for a high degree of flexibility in adapting the software to their specific needs. Additionally, the default theme from each previous version of REAPER is included, providing a starting point for users who may not have the time or inclination to create their own themes.
ReaScript allows users to customize REAPER by editing, running, and debugging scripts. This feature supports the creation of personalized themes, the extension of REAPER’s functionality, and the development of advanced macros and comprehensive extensions. Scripts can be written in EEL2 (JSFX/Jesusonic script), Lua, and Python.
ReaPack offers a comprehensive solution for managing and installing extensions sourced from a variety of repositories.
The SWS/S&amp;M extension (founded by Standing Water Studios' Tim Payne) is a widely used open-source extension to REAPER that offers workflow enhancements such as snapshots, marker actions, and advanced tempo/groove manipulation capabilities.
ReaClassical offers a fully open-source environment for classical music editing, featuring source-destination editing, multitrack track-group editing, and a two-lane crossfade editor.
Additionally, REAPER supports multiple languages, with downloadable language packs available. Both users and developers can create their own language packs for REAPER.
Included software and plug-ins.
REAPER comes with a variety of commonly used audio production effects. They include tools such as ReaEQ (parametric equalizer), ReaVerb (reverb), ReaGate (audio gate), ReaDelay (delay), ReaPitch (pitch shifting), ReaComp (compression), and ReaTune (automatic tuning of vocals or other audio). The included plug-ins are also accessible as a standalone download for users of other DAWs as the "ReaPlugs VST FX Suite".
Also included are hundreds of JSFX plug-ins ranging from standard effects to specific applications for MIDI and audio. JSFX scripts are editable text files, which when loaded into REAPER (exactly like a VST or other plug-in) become full-featured plugins ranging from simple audio effects (e.g delay, distortion, compression) to instruments (synths, samplers) and other special purpose tools (drum triggering and surround panning).
REAPER includes the instruments ReaSynth, ReaSynDr, and ReaSamplomatic 5000. ReaSynth is a basic synth with wave shape, ADSR Envelope, and Portamento. ReaSynDr has 4 drum samples, a kick, snare, blip, and tick. ReaSamplomatic 5000 is a sampler.
REAPER includes no third-party software but is fully compatible with all versions of the VST standard (currently VST2 and VST3). It can also run AU plugins (on macOS), CLAP plug-ins, DX plugins (on Windows), and LV2 plugins, and thus works with the vast majority of free and commercial plug-ins. REAPER x64 can also run 32-bit plug-ins alongside 64-bit processes. As of version 5.97, REAPER supports ARA 2 plugins.
Video editing.
REAPER allows video, audio, MIDI, and still images to be freely combined on any track. REAPER offers the ability to cut and trim video files and edit or replace their audio, and render out to various video formats. It supports common video effects such as fades, wipes, cross-fades, opacity, motion detection, and text titles. Video can be viewed in a separate window while working.

Thomas Hardy's Wessex

Thomas Hardy's Wessex is the fictional literary landscape created by the English author Thomas Hardy as the setting for his major novels, located in the south and southwest of England. Hardy named the area "Wessex" after the medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom that existed in this part of that country prior to the unification of England by Æthelstan. Although the places that appear in his novels actually exist, in many cases he gave the place a fictional name. For example, Hardy's home town of Dorchester is called Casterbridge in his books, notably in "The Mayor of Casterbridge". In an 1895 preface to the 1874 novel "Far from the Madding Crowd" he described Wessex as "a merely realistic dream country".
The actual definition of "Hardy's Wessex" varied widely throughout Hardy's career, and was not definitively settled until after he retired from writing novels. When he created the concept of a fictional Wessex, it consisted merely of the small area of Dorset in which Hardy grew up; by the time he wrote "Jude the Obscure", the boundaries had extended to include all of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, Hampshire, much of Berkshire, and some of Oxfordshire, with its most north-easterly point being Oxford (renamed "Christminster" in the novel). Cornwall was also referred to but named "Off Wessex". Similarly, the nature and significance of ideas of "Wessex" were developed over a long series of novels through a lengthy period of time. The idea of Wessex plays an important artistic role in Hardy's works (particularly his later novels), assisting the presentation of themes of progress, primitivism, sexuality, religion, nature and naturalism. However, this is complicated by the economic role Wessex played in Hardy's career. Considering himself primarily to be a poet, Hardy wrote novels mostly to earn money. Books that could be marketed under the Hardy brand of "Wessex novels" were particularly lucrative, which gave rise to a tendency to sentimentalised, picturesque, populist descriptions of Wessex.
Hardy's resurrection of the name "Wessex" is largely responsible for the popular modern use of the term to describe the south-west region of England (with the exception of Cornwall and arguably Devon). Today, a panoply of organisations take their name from Hardy to describe their relationship to the area. Hardy's conception of Wessex as a separate, cohesive geographical and political identity has proved powerful, although it was originally created purely as an artistic conceit, and has spawned a lucrative tourist trade, and even a devolutionist Wessex Regionalist Party.

Lucian Athanasius Reinhart

Brother Lucian Athanasius Reinhart, F.S.C. was an American De La Salle Brother who was last assigned to the De La Salle Brothers in the Philippines and was a President of De La Salle College in Manila.
Early life.
He was born James Hyde Reinhart on May 24, 1911, in Kansas City, Missouri and entered the novitiate of the Brothers of the Christian Schools at the La Salle Institute in Glencoe, Missouri, and received the religious habit in 1926, at which time he was given the religious name Lucian Athanasius. In 1929 he was assigned to the St. George High School in Evanston, Illinois, and two years later, he would earn his Master of Arts degree from DePaul University in Chicago. In 1933, he was assigned to the De La Salle Institute, also in Chicago, and finally to the Christian Brothers College in St. Louis in 1934.
Assignment to the Philippines.
In the mid-1930s, brother Reinhart volunteered for mission work and was sent to the Philippines, arriving in Manila on October 30, 1936. Upon his arrival, he was assigned as Pro-Director of the Brothers' Community and concurrent principal of the College's High School Department. He was also the first American Brother in the Philippines to earn a Doctor of Philosophy Degree, after writing a dissertation on the Educational Philosophy of John Baptist de La Salle at the University of Santo Tomas.
World War II.
During World War II, Reinhart was interned at Los Baños, Laguna, with the rest of the American Brothers. He would be freed by American troops in 1945 but would refuse to be returned to the United States.
Rehabilitation of De La Salle College.
Reinhart stayed in the Philippines to rehabilitate De La Salle College and was appointed its President in 1945. It was also during this time that he was forced to return to the United States for health reasons. In July 1946, he returned to Manila and formed new Faculty and Brother missionaries.
He died on May 27, 1950. The gym (on which lot the Don Enrique T. Yuchengco Hall now stands) of the De La Salle College was named in his memory as well as De La Salle University's Sports Complex, now the Enrique M. Razon Sports Center.

Piya Ka Ghar

Piya Ka Ghar ( My Beloved's House) is a 1972 Indian Hindi-language romantic comedy film directed by Basu Chatterjee, and produced by Rajshri Productions, starring Anil Dhawan and Jaya Bachchan. A remake of Raja Thakur's Marathi film "Mumbaicha Jawai", it portrays the difficulties of life in Mumbai during the 1970s in the form of a comic family drama. According to film and music expert Rajesh Subramanian, Amol Palekar was the first choice for the lead role, but an unfortunate misunderstanding led to Chatterjee casting Anil Dhawan.
Plot.
The two main characters are Ram and Malti. Ram lives in a chawl (tenement) in Mumbai. Malti initially lives in a relatively comfortable home in an unidentified village.
Ram and Malti are hooked up through a matchmaker that their parents have hired. The matchmaker first visits Malti's house, then he then visits Ram and his family (parents, two brothers, one sister-in-law, three uncles, and two aunts), who live together in a one-room apartment.
Ram and Malti fall in love, and Ram's family visits her in her village. Soon, they are married, and Malti moves to Ram's apartment, not knowing what to expect. Since there is very little room left in the apartment, the newlyweds are forced to sleep in the kitchen. They make several comical, but failed, attempts to have some privacy.
At last, Malti can bear it no longer, and her uncle arrives to take her back to the village. But when they see all her in-laws offering to move out on her account, they change their minds, saying that such love overcomes the difficulties of living in Mumbai. In the end, the couple finally finds the privacy they were seeking.
Soundtrack.
The following songs, listed in the order in which they appear. Lyrics are penned by Anand Bakshi and music is composed by Laxmikant Pyarelal. The song "Ye Jeevan Hai" sung by Kishore Kumar was frequently used in 2022 movie Uunchai in background as a part of the story plot.

Guangzhou Matsunichi F.C.

Guangzhou Matsunichi Football Club () was a professional football club based in Guangzhou, Guangdong, PR China who last played in the 21,570 capacity Xihe Sports Centre in Shaoguan. The club was established when the youth team for Guangzhou F.C. whom were allowed to participate within the Chinese football league pyramid and have promoted to the second tier was sold-off to Pan Sutong and his company Matsunichi Digital Holdings Limited to form a separate club on 28 February 1995. The club would soon gain promotion to the top tier of Chinese football where in total they spent three seasons before suffering relegation at the 1999 league season. When the club experienced another relegation campaign in 2000, Pan Sutong decided to pull his funding for the club, which officially became defunct on 26 November 2000.
History.
The club was founded on the basis of the youth team for Guangzhou F.C. who were established in 1990 and allowed to participate within the Chinese football league pyramid. They were often referred to as Guangzhou B and in their first appearance within the Chinese leagues they entered the third tier in the 1992 season where they came third, which was enough to gain promotion for the 1993 campaign. After the 1993 league season was restructured the club were allowed to make their second appearance in the 1994 campaign, this time within the second tier where they went on to come third. With these impressive positions and with the dawn of professionalism, which allowed private investors to own football clubs the club decided to take advantage of this and separate from their parent club and sell the team to Pan Sutong and his company Matsunichi Digital Holdings Limited to form Guangzhou Matsunichi F.C. on 28 February 1995.
In the club's debut season under new ownership the team continued their upswing in results and came runners-up within the division at the end of the 1995 campaign and gained promotion to the top tier for the first time. A reunion with Guangzhou Apollo would also occur on 25 June and 1 July 1995 within the Chinese FA Cup that saw Guangzhou Matsunichi win 4–3 on aggregate. The team's constantly rising trajectory, however would come to an end in the 1996 league season after the club were unable to handle the top tier and experienced relegation at the end of the campaign. After that disappointment the club hired former Chinese national team coach Xu Genbao in the hopes that his experience could revive the club's fortunes and one of his first acts was to persuade the then current Chinese international footballer Gao Hongbo to take a step down in leagues and join the club. This move would be a huge success and the club gained promotion back into the top tier in their first attempt.
In the 1998 league season Xu Genbao left the club to manage the reigning league champions Dalian Wanda, which saw the club bring in Brazilian coach Edson Tavares. The new coach would make sure that the club would remain within the league and actually guided the team to fourth, however after only one season with the club Tavares left the team. Gao Hongbo was promoted to coach, but his inexperience saw him leave during the season, which saw the club bring Liu Kang into the team but he was unable to stop the team slide down the table and experience relegation at the end of the 1999 campaign. On 22 December 2011 it would be discovered that the club's General manager knew that the referee for the club's vital final game of the season was bribed to help keep fellow struggling team Shenyang Sealion in the division and he took a bribe to keep silent. After the disappointing season the team were unable to recover and faced relegation again in the 2000 campaign, which saw Pan Sutong decide to pull his funding for the club. This saw the club financially unsustainable and it became officially defunct on 26 November 2000.

Donald Sadoway

Donald Robert Sadoway (born 7 March 1950) is professor emeritus of materials chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is a noted expert on batteries and has done significant research on how to improve the performance and longevity of portable power sources. In parallel, he is an expert on the extraction of metals from their ores and the inventor of molten oxide electrolysis, which has the potential to produce crude steel without the use of carbon reductant thereby totally eliminating greenhouse gas emissions.
Background.
Sadoway was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He did both his undergraduate and graduate studies at the University of Toronto, receiving his PhD in 1977. There he focused his studies on chemical metallurgy. He also served on the National Executive of the Ukrainian Canadian Students' Union (SUSK) from 1972 to 1974. In 1977, he received a NATO postdoctoral fellowship from the National Research Council of Canada and came to MIT to conduct his postdoctoral research under Julian Szekely. Sadoway joined the MIT faculty in 1978. On 19 June 2013, Sadoway was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Engineering by the University of Toronto in recognition of his contributions to sustainable energy and sustainable metal production as well as to higher education both in curriculum and in teaching style. In 2014, Sadoway received an honorary doctorate from NTNU, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
Research.
As a researcher, Sadoway has focused on environmental ways to extract metals from their ores, as well as producing more efficient batteries. His research has often been driven by the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving quality and lowering costs. He is the co-inventor of a solid polymer electrolyte. This material, used in his "sLimcell" has the capability of allowing batteries to offer twice as much power per kilogram as is possible in current lithium ion batteries.
In August 2006, a team that he led demonstrated the feasibility of extracting iron from its ore through molten oxide electrolysis. When powered exclusively by renewable electricity, this technique has the potential to eliminate the carbon dioxide emissions that are generated through traditional methods.
In 2009, Sadoway disclosed the liquid metal battery comprising liquid layers of magnesium and antimony separated by a layer of molten salt that could be used for stationary energy storage. Research on this concept was being funded by ARPA-E and the French energy company Total Experimental data showed a 69% DC-to-DC storage efficiency with good storage capacity and relatively low leakage current (self discharge). In 2010, with funding from Bill Gates and Total, Sadoway and two others, David Bradwell and Luis Ortiz, co-founded a company called the Liquid Metal Battery Corporation (later, Ambri) in order to scale up and commercialize the technology.
Teaching.
For 16 years Sadoway taught 3.091 Introduction to Solid State Chemistry at MIT, one of the largest classes at MIT. Sadoway's animated teaching style was popular with students and freshman enrollment in the course steadily increased through 2010.
In the fall of 2007, the number of students registering for 3.091 reached 570 students, over half the freshman class. The largest lecture hall available on campus seats 566 students. Sadoway much preferred teaching in one of the smaller lecture halls, seating only 450; as such, the institute had to take the unprecedented step of streaming digital video of the lecture into an overflow room to accommodate all the students interested in taking the course. In contrast, most classes at MIT are relatively small with approximately 60% of classes at MIT having fewer than 20 students. The popularity of this course has reached outside of the MIT campus as a result of the MIT OpenCourseWare initiative. This is seen in a comment by Bill Gates who told the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" "Everybody should watch chemistry lectures -- they're far better than you think. Don Sadoway, MIT -- best chemistry lessons anywhere. Unbelievable".
Sadoway's lectures often included the history of science, especially with respect to the Nobel Prize. Sadoway gave out "library assignments" in which he asked students to research Nobel Prize–winning papers. He began his lectures by playing music, which has some connection with the lecture's material. For example, for the lecture on hydrogen bonding he plays Handel's "Water Music". For one of the lectures on polymers he plays Aretha Franklin's "Chain of Fools". He ended his lectures with five minutes on the topic of "chemistry and the world around us". Examples include automotive exhaust catalytic converters (technology), forensic examination of paintings (chemistry in the fine arts), the mistreatment of Rosalind Franklin in the quest to discover the structure of DNA (intellectual dishonesty), the metallurgical failure that sank the "Titanic" (greed and incompetence), and the clarification of champagne (viticulture).
Media recognition.
On 29 February 2012, Sadoway gave a TED talk on his invention of the liquid metal battery for grid-scale storage. The talk is as much about the inventive process as it is about the technology.
Sadoway was named one of "Time" magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2012 for accomplishments in energy storage as well as his approach to mentoring students (hire the novice instead of the expert).
On 22 October 2012, Sadoway appeared as a guest on "The Colbert Report" to discuss his liquid metal battery technology and his view that electrochemistry is the key to world peace (batteries usher in the electric age reducing the dependence on petroleum dropping its price thereby destabilizing dictatorships).

Bactrian deer

The Bactrian deer (Cervus hanglu bactrianus), also called the Bukhara deer, Bokhara deer, or Bactrian wapiti, is a lowland subspecies of Central Asian red deer native to Central Asia. It is similar in ecology to the related Yarkand deer ("C. h. yarkandensis") in that it occupies riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. The subspecies are separated from one another by the Tian Shan Mountains and probably form a primordial subgroup of the red deer.
Description.
This deer is usually ashy-gray with yellowish sheen, and a grayish white rump patch. It also has a slightly marked dorsal stripe and a white margin of the upper lip, lower lip, and chin. The antlers are light in color. Usually, four tines are present, with the absence of bez tines. The fourth tine is better developed than the third. Full-grown individuals, however, have five tines on each antler with a bend after the third tine that is characteristic of most Central Asian red deer subspecies.
In contrast to the Yarkand deer, which has a light sandy coat, the Bactrian deer has a darker, grayish-brown coat pattern with darker legs, head, and neck (most noticeable in males) that resembles the coat of the American elk ("C. canadensis") or wapiti, which is why this subspecies is sometimes called the Bactrian wapiti. These deer do not have neck manes, but do have stronger and thicker neck muscles than female deer that may give the appearance of a neck mane. Female deer are slightly smaller than male deer, but the difference in size is not as pronounced as it is in the European red deer ("C. elaphus") species.
Bactrian deer have, like Yarkand deer, short tails similar to the short tails of wapitis. The calves are generally born spotted much like European red deer calves, and most individuals lose their spots by adulthood, but adult Bactrian deer may have a few spots on the backs of their summer coats. This phenomenon has also been observed in summer coats of the distantly related Manchurian wapiti ("C. c. xanthopygus") and subspecies of red deer.
Range.
This deer is found in central Khorasan. It is found in Russian Turkestan (West Turkestan) and adjacent areas in northern Afghanistan to the west of the Tian Shan Mountains. Bactrian deer live in lowland riparian corridors of mixed deciduous (willow/poplar) vegetation surrounded by deserts. They do not migrate, but may disperse into adjacent desert areas at night or at times of cooler temperatures.
Population.
By 1999, not more than 400 Bukhara deer remained. The population diminished most drastically in Tajikistan because of military conflicts. Since then, though, environmental organizations have taken steps to save the species. 
Moreover, World Wide Fund for Nature implemented a reintroduction programme to bring Bukhara deer back to the places where they had once inhabited. For example, Bactrian deer have been reintroduced into the Zarafshan reserve in Uzbekistan; and in the Syrdarya–Turkestan State Regional Natural Park in the Turkistan Region of Kazakhstan. In 2021, it was announced that the in Kazakhstan released 61 Burkhara deer in efforts to revive the species in the Balkhash Region.
As a result of conservation efforts, the deer populations have increased. In 2006, about 1,000 deer lived in Central Asia. The largest wild populations were found in 2009 in the Karatchingil Nature Reserve (320–350 animals) in the neighborhood of Altyn-Emel National Park in Kazakhstan; in the Badai Tugai Nature Reserve (374 animals) in Uzbekistan; and in the Tigrovaya Balka Nature Reserve (&gt;150 animals) in Tajikistan. The total wild population in 2011 is 1,430 and increasing.
Conservation.
Under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, also known as the Bonn Convention, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) concerning Conservation and Restoration of the Bukhara Deer was concluded and came into effect on 16 May 2002. Acknowledging that the Bukhara deer faces threat of extinction as a result of human activities, the MoU provides an intergovernmental framework for governments, scientists and other groups to monitor and coordinate ongoing conservation efforts.
In 2013, ecologist Zalmai Moheb and a team of researchers found positive sign on their existence.
The fourth release of Bactrian deer was held in the Ile-Balkhash reserve, reported the Forestry and Wildlife Committee of the Kazakh Ministry of Ecology, Geology, and Natural Resources on July 11, 2022. Overall, there are 150 species to date.
Predators.
Aside from man, the Himalayan wolf is probably the most dangerous of predators that most Bactrian deer encounter. Occasionally, the brown bear prey on these deer, as well. Other possible predators are dholes and snow leopards. Eurasian lynx and wild boars sometimes prey on the calves. In the past, they were also hunted by the now-extinct Caspian tiger.

Glucose cycle

The glucose cycle (also known as the hepatic futile cycle) occurs primarily in the liver and is the dynamic balance between glucose and glucose 6-phosphate. This is important for maintaining a constant concentration of glucose in the blood stream.
Function.
The glucose cycle is required for one of the liver functions; the homeostasis of glucose in the blood stream. When the blood glucose level is too high, glucose can be stored in the liver as glycogen. When the level is too low, the glycogen can be catabolised and glucose may re-enter the blood stream.
The catabolic process occurs at the nonreducing end of glycogen. A phosphate group breaks the bond between C 1 of a glucose ring and the O that connects it to the next(phosphorolysis). One glucose unit is thus split off. Glycogen (with n glucose units) is converted into G-1-P(a PO4 group now attaches to C1 where O used to ) and glycogen (with n-1 glucose units) by enzyme glycogen phosphorylase. G-1-P is then converted into G-6-P by enzyme phosphoglucomutase. A water molecule hydrolyses G-6-P to glucose, the enzyme is glucose-6-phosphatase.
Cell specificity.
When glucose enters a cell it is rapidly changed to glucose 6-phosphate, by hexokinase or glucokinase. The glucose cycle can occur in liver cells due to a liver specific enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which catalyse the dephosphorylation of glucose 6-phosphate back to glucose.
Glucose-6-phosphate is the product of glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis, where the goal is to increase free glucose in the blood due body being in catabolic state. Other cells such as muscle and brain cells do not contain glucose 6-phosphatase. As a result, any glucose 6-phosphate produced in those cells is committed to cellular metabolic pathways, primarily pentose phosphate pathway or glycolysis.
Regulation of glucose cycle.
Flux through the glucose cycle is regulated by several hormones including insulin and glucagon as well as allosteric regulation of both hexokinase and glucose 6-phosphatase.
Diseases associated with glucose cycle.
A deficiency in glucose 6-phosphatase that disrupts the liver glucose cycle, can lead to von Gierke's disease.

Hærvejen

Hærvejen (Danish, literally: "the army road", , literally: "oxen way", , literally: oxen path), sometimes referred to in English as the Ox Road, is the name given to an ancient trackway in Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein. The route runs from Viborg via Flensburg to Hamburg, the territory of which it entered at Ochsenzoll ("oxen toll", "toll" in the meaning of "customs") and where it connected with other roads. It has been known by several other names throughout history, most importantly "the Cattle Road" ("Studevejen") and "the Oxen Road" or "Ox Road" ("Oksevejen" / "Ochsenweg").
History.
The road runs more or less along the watershed of the Jutland Peninsula, known as the "Jyske Højderyg" (Jutland Ridge), similar to the ridgeways in England. By using this route one could avoid rivers, or ford them close to their origins where they were still shallow. As time went by this route was improved with paved fords, embankments and bridges. Concentrations of mounds, defensive ditches, settlements and other historic landmarks can be found along the road. While sections of it can be traced as far back as 4000 BC, newer road construction has erased many traces. Some of them show a width of up to . The use of the road declined during the Viking age, as transportation by ship became more convenient. New cities were constructed along the coast instead of the road.
Two of Denmark's oldest settlements, Viborg and Jelling are situated along the road.
In the southern, narrow part of the Jutish peninsula the trackway followed the edge of western marshes and eastern moraine country. Near Haderslev, Åbenrå, Flensburg, and Schleswig, it branched into western bypasses on the hills and accesses to the towns, each of them localized at the inner end of a long, narrow bay. One of the southern ends of the Ochsenweg has given its name to a suburb of Hamburg: "Ochsenzoll" is the locality of the ancient custom post.
Part of the tracks westerly bypassed Hamburg towards Wedel bei Hamburg or Blankenese, where a ferry passing the Elbe connected to Cranz (then Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen). An easterly bypass headed for Zollenspieker Ferry (a Hamburg-Lübeckian condominium between 1420 and 1868), passing the same river towards Hoopte in the then Principality of Lunenburg. From south of the Elbe the cattle tracks continued up to Westphalia.
Use.
The road was primarily a trade road. The most important commodity was livestock (especially the eponymous oxen), but also amber, hides, honey and fur went south. Annually up to 50,000 head of cattle came along the oxen road prior to the Industrial Age. Metal, glass and weapons went north. In spite of the most familiar Danish name, it was seldom used for military invasions, neither northwards, nor southwards. Nevertheless, many defensive constructions can be found straddling the road up through Jutland.
Today.
Today modern highways follow the route of the old road. At a few places it is still possible to see the old tracks, embankments, sheep pens and fords. 
Parts of it have been converted into a long-distance walking route. A popular walk known as "Hærvejsmarchen" takes place each year. An international cycle route has been marked from the Elbe to Viborg.

Tibetan red deer

The Tibetan red deer (Cervus canadensis wallichi) also known as shou, is a subspecies of elk/wapiti native to the southern Tibetan highlands and Bhutan. Once believed to be near-extinct, its population has increased to over 8,300, the majority of which live in a 120,000-hectare nature reserve established in 1993 in Riwoqê County, Qamdo Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region, China.
Some have been kept at the beginning of the 20th century in London, and in a small zoo south of Lhasa.
Description.
The Tibetan red deer is relatively massive built with short legs and a large, square muzzle. The winter fur is light sandy-brown, except the grayish face. The summer coat is slate-gray. The large, white rump patch, which includes the short tail, has no dark rim as it is seen in the Sichuan deer, for example. Those from the eastern part of the range have a dark dorsal line and represent probably the "C. c. affinis" type, which is now usually included in the "shou".
Relationships and range.
Tibetan red deer, along with Sichuan deer and Kansu red deer, forms the southern group of wapiti.
It lives in northern Bhutan and southern Tibet, where it is recorded from the Chumbi Valley close to Sikkim and from Lake Manasarovar. It was believed to be completely extinct until a small population was rediscovered in 1988 in Bhutan and southeastern Tibet. The original range probably covered many smaller valleys of the Brahmaputra River to the north of the Himalaya (Yarlung Tsangpo River).
A survey in 1995 brought the exciting finding, that a population of about 200 Tibetan red deer still persists to the north of the Yarlung Tsangpo River close to the village of Zhenqi. As this is the only known viable population of this deer, it is planned to establish a reserve for protection here. Evidence for some other relict populations has been found around the Subansiri River.
They are preyed on by the Himalayan wolf.

Hyakki Yagyō

Hyakki Yagyō (, "Night Parade of One Hundred Demons"), also transliterated Hyakki Yakō, is an idiom in Japanese folklore. Sometimes an orderly procession, other times a riot, it refers to a parade of thousands of supernatural creatures known as "oni" and "yōkai" that march through the streets of Japan at night. As a terrifying eruption of the supernatural into the real world, it is similar (though not precisely equivalent) to the concept of pandemonium in English.
Various legends.
Over more than one thousand years of history, and its role as a popular theme in traditional storytelling and art, a great deal of folklore has developed around the concept, making it difficult if not impossible to isolate any canonical meanings. 
One legend of recent vintage states that "every year the "yōkai" Nurarihyon, will lead all of the "yōkai" through the streets of Japan during summer nights." Anyone who comes across the procession would perish or be spirited away by the "yōkai", unless protected by exorcism scrolls handwritten by "Onmyōji" spell-casters. It is said that only an onmyōji clan head is strong enough to pass Nurarihyon's Hyakki Yagyō unharmed.
According to another account in the Shūgaishō (拾芥抄), a medieval Japanese encyclopedia, the only way to be kept safe from the night parade if it were to come by your house is to stay inside on the specific nights associated with the Chinese zodiac or to chant the magic spell: "KA-TA-SHI-HA-YA, E-KA-SE-NI-KU-RI-NI, TA-ME-RU-SA-KE, TE-E-HI, A-SHI-E-HI, WA-RE-SHI-KO-NI-KE-RI" (カタシハヤ, エカセニクリニ, タメルサケ, テエヒ, アシエヒ, ワレシコニケリ).
In literature.
The "Hyakki Yagyō" has appeared in several tales collected by Japanese folklorists.
In art.
The night parade was a popular theme in Japanese visual art.
One of the oldest and most famous examples is the 16th-century handscroll "Hyakki Yagyō Zu" (百鬼夜行図), erroneously attributed to Tosa Mitsunobu, located in the Shinju-an of Daitoku-ji, Kyoto. For other picture scrolls, the "Hyakki Yagyō Emaki" (百鬼夜行絵巻), contains the details of each member in the parade from the Muromachi period.
Other notable works in this motif include those by Toriyama Sekien ("Gazu Hyakki Yagyō") and Utagawa Yoshiiku. However, Toriyama's work presents "yōkai" in separate, encyclopedic entries rather than assembled in a parade, while Utagawa's "Kokkei Wanisshi-ki" ("Comical Record of Japanese History," 滑稽倭日史記) employs the theme of 100 demons to comment on contemporary Japanese military actions in China.

Russ Shafer-Landau

Russ Shafer-Landau (born 1963) is an American philosopher and professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
Education and career.
Shafer-Landau is a graduate of Brown University and completed his PhD work at the University of Arizona under the supervision of Joel Feinberg. He has been teaching philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, Madison from 2002, where he became chair of the department. From 1992 to 2002 Shafer-Landau taught at the University of Kansas.
He is the founder and editor of the periodical "Oxford Studies in Metaethics." Shafer-Landau returned to UW after a brief stint at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where he also served as the director of the Parr Center for Ethics. Shafer-Landau is the founder and organizer for the annual Madison Metaethics Workshop (also referred to as MadMeta, founded in 2004) which followed him to North Carolina under the name "CHillMeta," before re-assuming its original identity when Shafer-Landau returned to UW.
From 2020 to 2021, Shafer-Landau served as the Central President of the American Philosophical Association.
Philosophical work.
Shafer-Landau is a leading defender of a non-naturalistic moral realism, holding that moral statements are not reducible to natural terms. For example, the term 'good' cannot be described in terms of what is pleasurable and painful, nor conclusions within science. This view is established in his major work "," which, as one reviewer expressed it, "defends an unorthodox combination of claims, including anti-Humeanism about reasons for action, mind-independent moral realism, moral non-naturalism, moral rationalism, and reliabilist moral epistemology."
Shafer-Landau is also the author of two other introductory books, "Whatever Happened To Good And Evil?" and "The Fundamentals of Ethics." Besides editing the annual "Oxford Studies in Metaethics," he also has co-edited "Reason and Responsibility: Readings in Some Basic Problems of Philosophy", an anthology covering many aspects of ethics with the late Joel Feinberg and two Blackwell anthologies, "Foundations of Ethics" (with Terence Cuneo), and "Ethical Theory".

Eight Belles Stakes

The Eight Belles Stakes is a Grade II American Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-old filly sprinters run at a distance of 7 furlongs at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky each year on Kentucky Oaks Day.
History.
The inaugural running of the event was on the opening day of the 1956 Spring meeting at Churchill Downs on Saturday, 27 April 1956 as the seventh and main feature race on the nine race program named the Oaks Prep over a distance of six furlongs. The event attracted the 1955 US Champion Two-Year-Old Filly Doubledogdare and Calumet Farm's fine filly Princess Turia. The event was scheduled as a preparatory event for the much longer Kentucky Oaks which was scheduled on the following Friday. Doubledogdare started as the 2/5 odds-on favorite and held off Princess Turia to win by half a length in a time of 1:11. However, six days later Princess Turia turned the tables and defeated her rival in the Kentucky Oaks by a neck.
In 1961 the distance of the event was increased to seven furlongs.
The 1962 winner Cicada started 3/10 odds-on and easily won the event by four lengths under the reins of US Hall of Fame jockey William L. Shoemaker. Cicada then proceeded to win the Kentucky Oaks en route to being crowned US Champion Three-Year-Old Filly.
In 1967 the event was renamed to the La Troienne Stakes for one of the greatest broodmares in the United States throughout the twentieth century, La Troienne. The 1967 winner Fure Sail would go on to being crowned US Champion Three-Year-Old Filly as would the 1968 winner Dark Mirage and 1972 winner Susan's Girl. The 1972 Canadian Horse of the Year La Prevoyante would win the event in 1973.
In 1982 the event was run in split divisions. This was only time that the event was run in split divisions.
The event was classified as Grade III in 1998.
Between 2004 and 2010 the event was run over a lightly longer distance of furlongs.
Churchill Downs announced that beginning in 2009 this race would be called the Eight Belles Stakes in honor of the deceased filly, Eight Belles, who finished second in the 2008 Kentucky Derby. In 2010, the Louisville Distaff Stakes was renamed the La Troienne Stakes.
Since 2011 the event has been scheduled on the same card as the Kentucky Oaks.
The American Graded Stakes Committee upgraded the race to its current Grade II status in 2016.

Sichuan deer

The Sichuan deer (Cervus canadensis macneilli), also known as MacNeill's deer, is a subspecies of the Elk native to Western China.
Description.
This large, highland deer is of very pale, finely spotted color with gray or brownish black. The winter coat is of a brownish wash. These deer, along with the Tibetan red deer, are the largest subspecies of Central Asian red deer. Older adult males may carry six tines on each antler similar to wapiti subspecies. Also, unlike other Central Asian red deer subspecies, females do have short neck manes during the winter.
Range/discovery.
This rare deer was first described in 1909 from a female specimen. 26 years later, male specimens were found and its true status became known. It lives along the Chinese-Tibetan border.

The End of Violence

The End of Violence is a 1997 American drama film by the German director Wim Wenders. The film's cast includes Bill Pullman, Andie MacDowell, Gabriel Byrne, Traci Lind, Rosalind Chao, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Udo Kier, and Loren Dean, among others. It also features a soundtrack marked with the signature sounds of Wenders regulars Jon Hassell, Ry Cooder, and Bono. The film was praised by a select few critics for its cinematography, but performed poorly in the box office. It was entered into the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.
The film had a budget of $5 million, but only received $386,673 in its domestic box office.
Like many other of Wenders' American films, the film was shot in multiple locations, for instance the Griffith Observatory in Griffith Park and the Santa Monica Pier.
A scene in the film shows a live recreation of the painting "Nighthawks" by Edward Hopper.
Plot.
Film producer Mike Max meditates on the paranoia of fear of attack, in the film industry and life in general, as his wife Paige announces she is leaving him. He receives a document via email from a NASA employee whom he met earlier at a conference. Before opening it, Mike is kidnapped and almost killed, a scene captured by surveillance cameras and witnessed by computer scientist Ray Bering on surveillance footage scene in his laboratory at the Griffith Observatory.
However, it soon turns out the two men have been shot, Max has escaped and now is accused of killing them. He takes shelter with, and goes to work for, the Mexican gardeners who find him, and help him investigate who is trying to kill him and why. Bering, who originally sent Max the email and recognized Max in the surveillance footage, has a conversation with an intelligence agent who makes it clear that anyone who gets in the way of a new “anti-crime” satellite surveillance program not yet approved by Congress will be dealt with terminally.
Detective Dean Brock suspects Max is not a killer and on a tip meets with Bering, who is assassinated by a gunshot as they begin to speak. Max gives up his business and money to his wife and the film ends as he meditates on how a real attack has freed him from paranoia.
Production.
The film was produced through Ciby 2000 but acquired by MGM for $2-$3 million in November 1996.
Reception.
"The End of Violence" received negative reviews from critics. It holds a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews with an average rating of 5/10. 
Writing in Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston (critic) observed: "Many of Wenders's best films have been road movies and "Violence" qualifies as one thanks to all the time the characters spend on L.A.'s freeways. Like Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" (which it resembles in a lot of ways), it cleverly exploits its Southern California locale and offers a truly challenging analysis of American life."

Sakadagami

In Buddhism, the Sakadāgāmin (Pali; Sanskrit: "Sakṛdāgāmin", ), "returning once" or "once-returner," is a partially enlightened person, who has cut off the first three chains with which the ordinary mind is bound, and significantly weakened the fourth and fifth. Sakadagaminship is the second stage of the four stages of enlightenment.
The Sakadagami will be reborn into the realm of the senses at most once more. If, however, they attain the next stage of enlightenment (Anagamiship) in this life, they will not come back to this world.
The three specific chains or fetters (Pali: ) of which the Sakadagamin is free are:&lt;br&gt;
1. (Pali) - Belief in self (ātman)&lt;br&gt;
2. Sīlabbata-parāmāsa (Pali) - Attachment to rites and rituals&lt;br&gt;
3. Vicikicchā (Pali) - Skeptical doubt&lt;br&gt;The Sakadagami also significantly weakened the chains of:&lt;br&gt;
4. Kāma-rāga (Pali) - Sensuous craving&lt;br&gt;
5. Vyāpāda (Pali) - Ill-will
Thus, the Sakadagamin is an intermediate stage between the Sotapanna, who still has comparatively strong sensuous desire and ill-will, and the Anagami, who is completely free from sensuous desire and ill-will. A Sakadagami's mind is very pure. Thoughts connected with greed, hatred and delusion do not arise often, and when they do, do not become obsessive.

Manchurian wapiti

The Manchurian wapiti (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus) is a putative subspecies of the wapiti native to East Asia. It may be identified as its own species, Cervus xanthopygus.
Description.
The Manchurian wapiti's coat is reddish brown during summer, and brownish gray in winter. It has dark hairs on the neck and dark underparts, followed by a light-colored rump patch. It is smaller than Altai wapiti (Cervus canadensis sibiricus) with smaller and stouter antlers.
Male deer are wapiti-like with a neck mane, and as mentioned, relatively small wapiti-like antlers. Female deer are more red deer-like and lack neck manes. This deer is the most "red deer-like" of the wapiti, being adapted to mixed deciduous forest environments in Manchuria, Yakutia, Northern China, Eastern Mongolia, and North Korea. Like many wapiti, adult deer may have some visible spots in their summer coats.
In the Manchurian Mountains cows weigh 150-180 kg and bulls weigh 200-250 kg, and bulls attain measurements of 1.5 m in height and 2.4 m in length. Manchurian wapiti are considered the smallest among the other elks, in other parts of Manchuria they may have larger sizes. 
Range.
This deer is found in southeastern Siberia (to the east of Lake Baikal), northeastern Mongolia, Manchuria, North Korea and northeastern China. 
Similar forms from Alxa, Gansu, Shanxi and southern Mongolia were originally described as a distinct subspecies, the Alashan wapiti ("Cervus canadensis alashanicus"). However, a genetic research in 2004 indicates that this deer belongs to the Manchurian subspecies. However, due to the insufficient genetic material that rejects monophyly of "C. canadensis", the 2006 study considered it premature to include the Manchurian wapiti as a true subspecies of wapiti, and that it likely needs to be elevated to its own species, "C. xanthopygus".

U Thong (, ) is the district ("amphoe") in the western part of Suphan Buri province, north of Bangkok.
History.
Higham states, "U-Thong was occupied for many centuries prior to the development of the Dvaravati state. Radiocarbon determinations from the sites of U-Thong and Chansen suggest that the transition into complex state societies in the Chao Phraya basin took place between about 300-600 AD." A copper inscription from the mid-7th century states, "Sri Harshavarman, grandson of Ishanavarman, having expanded his sphere of glory, obtained the lion throne through regular succession," and mentions gifts to a linga. The site includes a moat, 1,690 by 840 m, and the Pra Paton caitya.
It also became the origin of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, as the first King of Ayutthaya, Ramathibodi, was prince of U Thong when the city was struck by an epidemic, prompting him to relocate east and found Ayutthaya.
U Thong district was created with the name "Chorakhe Sam Phan" in 1905. In 1939 the district was renamed U Thong. In 1944, the government moved the centre of the district from Ban Chorakhe Sam Phan to the area of the ancient city.

Atomic Games was acquired by Destineer on May 6, 2005, while collaborating on "Close Combat: Red Phoenix" and "". Atomic Games was developing a third-person shooter, "Six Days in Fallujah", in cooperation with Konami, until the latter decided to withdraw from the project in August 2009, causing significant layoffs at Atomic Games. The company went on to finish the game, but never released it. Atomic Games released the game called "Breach", which is a multiplayer-only downloadable first-person shooter. Destineer also owned Bold Games, and MacSoft, who also went down with Destineer.
With Avalon Hill.
Avalon Hill, a game publishing company and subsidiary of Hasbro, signed with Avalon Hill in 1993 and they started developing "Beyond Squad Leader" and the "World at War" series for its new publisher. Rose, hired to lead Avalon Hill's computer game division in December 1992, had been tasked with reviving this section of the business in the face of flagging board game sales. The two companies' first collaboration, "Operation Crusader", reused the engine of the "V for Victory" series. "PC Gamer US" wargame columnist William R. Trotter named it one of the top-five wargames of 1994.
Atomic and Avalon experienced creative friction during the development of their projects together. "Computer Gaming World" columnist Alan Emrich wrote in 1995, "To say there was no love lost between [...] Jim Rose and Atomic's Keith Zabalaoui would be a gracious understatement." By June 1995, Rose had left Avalon Hill to found TalonSoft, and "Beyond Squad Leader" had entered alpha testing.

P.M. Place Stores, also known as Place's Discount Stores was a Bethany, Missouri-based, employee-owned chain of discount stores in the United States. The company primarily operated in towns with a population of 1,500 to 4,000 people in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri.
Origins.
P.M. Place Stores was founded in 1910 by Pryor M. Place in Lathrop, Missouri. Place financed his company by selling his horse, saddle, and bridle, and collected his savings to buy goods to stock his shelves.
Store format.
Place's stores carried the same departments as larger discount stores except on a smaller scale. Stores ranged from around . to . Their prominent slogan was "The Best of All... Places" which could be heard on a recording that would repeatedly play in their stores amongst music and announcement of the latest sale items.
Expansion.
In 1985 the company expanded through the acquisition of Matco/Mattingly stores, a Lexington, Missouri based chain of discount stores.
Place's attempted to grow to 75 stores by the end of 2002 but was bought by ShopKo in 2000 for $22 million with a store count of 49. ShopKo converted these stores into Pamida stores.
At the time of assimilation into Pamida, Place's president and CEO was Charles M. Place. Charles Patterson "Pat" Place had previously been in charge of the company.
In an effort to streamline Pamida's distribution operations, the Bethany cross-dock facility, formerly the Place's warehouse, was closed in early 2002.

Pit cave

A pit cave, shaft cave or vertical cave—or often simply called a pit (in the US) and pothole or pot (in the UK); jama in Slavic languages scientific and colloquial vocabulary (borrowed since early research in the Western Balkan Dinaric Alpine karst)—is a type of cave which contains one or more significant vertical shafts rather than being predominantly a conventional horizontal cave passage. Pits typically form in limestone as a result of long-term erosion by water. They can be open to the surface or found deep within horizontal caves. Among US cavers, a pit, usually referred to as a 'pitch' in UK English, is a vertical drop of any depth that cannot be negotiated safely without the use of ropes or ladders.
Pit caving.
Techniques.
Exploration of pit caves ("vertical caving", also called "potholing" in the UK and "pit caving" in US English) requires the use of equipment such as nylon kernmantle rope or cable ladders. The specialized caving techniques of single rope technique (SRT) are common practice and the preferred method of pit exploration for cavers worldwide. SRT involves the use of 8–11 mm nylon static rope and mechanical descenders/ascenders.
Vertical caving is a specialized sport that should be undertaken only after acquiring knowledge of, and expertise in, proper vertical caving equipment and its use. For obvious reasons, vertical caving is more dangerous than "horizontal caving". Vertical caving requires an understanding of ropes, knots, anchors, abseiling/rappelling devices and ascending systems, and techniques for passing rebelays, deviations, knot passes (where two ropes are joined mid-hang) and changeovers (the act of switching from rappel to climb, or vice versa, whilst on rope). Experienced cavers are typically knowledgeable in self-rescue techniques such as rigging pulley-jammers and doing pick-offs (the act of rescuing a stranded caver from his rope and returning him/her to the ground).
History.
Pit caving was pioneered by the English geologist John Beaumont (c. 1650–1731) who gave an account of his descent into Lamb Leer Cavern to the Royal Society in 1681. French caver Édouard-Alfred Martel (1859–1938) first achieved the descent and exploration of the Gouffre de Padirac, France, as early as 1889 and the first complete descent of a wet vertical shaft at Gaping Gill, in Yorkshire, England, in 1895. He developed his own techniques using ropes and metallic ladders. In the 1930s, as caving became increasingly popular in France, several clubs in the Alps developed vertical cave exploration into a recognized outdoor sport.
During World War II, a team composed of Pierre Chevalier, Fernand Petzl, Charles Petit-Didier and others explored the Dent de Crolles cave system near Grenoble, France. It became known as the deepest cave in the world () at that time. The lack of available technical equipment during the war forced Chevalier and his team to innovate and develop their own. The scaling-pole (1940), nylon ropes (1942), use of explosives in caves (1947), and mechanical rope ascenders (Henri Brenot's "monkeys", first used by Chevalier and Brenot in a cave in 1934) can be traced historically to the exploration of the Dent de Crolles cave system.
In the late 1950s, American caver Bill Cuddington further developed the single rope technique (SRT) in the United States. In 1958, two Swiss alpinists, Juesi and Marti, teamed up, creating the first rope ascender, known as the Jumar. In 1968, Bruno Dressler asked Petzl, who worked as a metals machinist, to build a rope-ascending tool, today known as the Petzl Croll, which he had developed by adapting the Jumar to the specificity of pit caving. Pursuing these developments, in the 1970s Fernand Petzl started a small caving equipment manufacturing company. The development of the rappel rack and the evolution of mechanical ascension systems, notably helped extend the practice and safety of pit exploration to a larger practice by established cavers.

Paradox (Canadian band)

Paradox was a Canadian band formed in the 1980s by singer/guitarist Sylvain Cossette. The band's best known lineup featured Sylvain on vocals, Francois Cossette (guitar), Denis Lavigne (drums), and Jean-Francois Houle (bass). The band broke up in 1991.
History.
Quebec-born Sylvain Cossette formed the Anglophone band Paradox with Denis Lavigne and Jean-Francois Houle as a cover band in Grand-Mère, Quebec, in 1984. After establishing a local reputation for their live act, the band received a FACTOR award in June 1988. This grant allowed them to record a demo which eventually led to a record deal with MCA Music America. With Sylvain's brother Francois joining the lineup on guitar, the band recorded their self-titled debut album "Paradox" at Studio Victor in Montreal in 1988. Produced by Pierre 'Baz' Bazinet (who was best known for his work with other Canadian acts including Luba and Boulevard), much of the album was co-written with Sass Jordan whose own star was rising at the time. The band produced a couple of videos that saw regular rotation on MuchMusic thanks to the catchy hooks and their video friendly looks. In recognition for their airplay and touring across Canada, they were nominated in 1990 for a Juno Award for "Most Promising Group of the Year".
A second album "Obvious Puzzle" followed in 1991, which didn't capture as much attention as their debut. After a final concert in 1991 at the Spectrum in Montreal, the band broke up and Sylvain continued his career as a French solo artist.

Douce II, Countess of Provence

Douce II (, ; 1162–1172) was Countess of Provence and Viscountess of Gévaudan and Carlat for a few months in 1166, as well as Countess of Melgueil for some time in 1172. She was a member of the House of Barcelona, which acquired the County of Provence through the marriage of Douce I to Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona.
Life.
Douce was the sole child of the Provençal count Ramon Berenguer II and the Castilian queen dowager Richeza of Poland, who married in 1162. In 1165, with the treaty signed in Beaucaire, Ramon Berenguer betrothed his infant daughter to Raymond, eldest son and heir apparent of Raymond V, ruler of the neighbouring County of Toulouse. When Ramon Berenguer died trying to conquer Nice in the spring of 1166, Douce inherited the County of Provence.
Immediately after her accession, Raymond V entered Provence to ensure that the betrothal would be honored. In order to secure his position, he attempted to arrange a marriage with Douce's mother. His efforts came to nothing due to intervention of the young King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona, Alfonso. Alfonso was the first cousin of Douce's father and his closest agnate. He and his council claimed that he had the right to Provence on the basis of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa's enfeoffment of 1162, and consequently he adopted the title Margrave of Provence. In order to gain time, Alfonso wrote to Raymond to tell him that he consented to the planned marriages of both Douce and her mother. Conflict soon ensued, however, and despite initial setbacks, Alfonso prevailed over Raymond. He arrived in Provence by the end of 1166. William VII of Montpellier was the first of Douce's vassals to declare allegiance to him, followed by the rest.
In 1168, Alfonso granted Provence to his brother, Ramon Berenguer III. Douce was thus finally dispossessed of her inheritance, but retained the comital title. She moved to the court of her paternal grandmother, Beatrice, Countess of Melgueil. In April 1172, Beatrice decided that the County of Melgueil should be divided between her daughter, Ermessende of Pelet, and Douce, still betrothed to Raymond of Toulouse. Douce died the same year, however, and all of Melgueil passed to her half-aunt, who also married her fiancé.

Prathai district

Prathai (, ; , ) is a district ("amphoe") in the northeastern part of Nakhon Ratchasima province, northeastern Thailand.
History.
Prathai village was settled in the Khmer era. King Jayavarman II set his camp in the area when he expanded his power to the west. After his reign, Prathai was deserted. It became a community again in the Sukhothai era.
Prathai in Khmer means 'camp'.
Tambon Prathai was separated from Bua Yai district to create a minor district ("king amphoe") on 1 January 1961 and upgraded to a full district in 1963.
Geography.
Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise): Phon and Nong Song Hong of Khon Kaen province; Ban Mai Chaiyaphot of Buriram province; and Mueang Yang, Chum Phuang, Phimai, Non Daeng, Sida, and Bua Lai of Nakhon Ratchasima Province.
Administration.
Central administration.
Prathai is divided into 13 sub-districts ("tambons"), which are further subdivided into 151 administrative villages ("mubans").

2000 American Le Mans Series

The 2000 American Le Mans Series was the second running of the IMSA American Le Mans Series, and overall the 30th season of an IMSA GT Championship, dating back to the 1971 edition. It was a series for Le Mans Prototypes (LMP) and Grand Touring (GT) race cars divided into 3 classes: LMP, GTS, and GT. It began March 18, 2000 and ended December 31, 2000 after 12 races.
This season was the first time that the ALMS held races outside of North America, with two events held in Europe and one in Australia. These events helped with the creation of the 2001 European Le Mans Series season, although it was short-lived. An Asian Le Mans Series was also discussed but not developed.
Schedule.
The 2000 schedule greatly expanded from the previous season, adding not only three races outside North America, but an additional North American round as well. Silverstone Circuit and the Nürburgring were scheduled before and after the 24 Hours of Le Mans, while the Race of a Thousand Years in Australia was held long after the North American season ended. Road courses at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Texas Motor Speedway replaced the previous year's Grand Prix of Atlanta at Road Atlanta.

Damaraland mole-rat

The Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis), Damara mole rat or Damaraland blesmol, is a burrowing rodent found in southern Africa. Along with the smaller, less hairy, naked mole rat, it is a species of eusocial mammal.
Description.
Like other blesmols, the Damaraland mole-rat has a cylindrical body with short, stout limbs, large feet, and a conical head. It is also similar in size to most other African mole-rats, having a head-body length of , with a short, , tail, and weighing between . There are no external ears, and the blue-coloured eyes are tiny with thick eyelids. The incisor teeth are large and prominent, with flaps of skin behind them to prevent soil from falling into the throat while the animal is using them to dig.
The fur is short and thick, and varies from fawn to almost black, with shades of brown being most common. There is always a white patch on the top of the head, although its exact shape varies, and there may also be additional blotches of white fur elsewhere on the body. Longer sensory hairs project above the fur over much of the body, with the facial whiskers being particularly long. Females have six teats.
Distribution and habitat.
Although named specifically for Damaraland, the mole-rats are found across much of southern Africa, including Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. They inhabit warm, semi-arid environments dominated by savannah scrubland or sandy grasslands. They are most commonly associated with red Kalahari psamments, and are found only where there is a sufficient supply of plants with subterranean storage organs.
Biology.
Damaraland mole-rats are herbivorous, feeding solely on tubers, corms, and bulbs. Favoured foods include such plants as "Acanthosicyos", Star-of-Bethlehem, "Ledebouria", and "Talinum". Their natural predators include mole snakes, and occasionally other local snakes, such as cobras. They do not drink, obtaining all their water from their food, which is also an important source of minerals. Unlike most other mammals, they can effectively metabolise these minerals without access to vitamin D, which they lack because they are normally never exposed to sunlight. The basal metabolic rate of Damaraland mole rats is also unusually low for mammals of their size, at just 0.66 cm3 O2 / g · h.
Despite living in an entirely subterranean environment, Damaraland mole-rats exhibit circadian rhythms, and are active primarily during the day. Their levels of the hormone melatonin can be altered by artificially changing the length of apparent daylight, suggesting that they are at least able to distinguish light from dark, although their eyesight may otherwise be very poor.
Behaviour.
Damaraland mole-rats live in networks of tunnels, which they dig with their front teeth. The tunnels are in diameter, and may stretch for up to . They have no connection to the surface, although their presence can be inferred from dome-shaped molehills of excavated earth pushed up to the surface. As a result, the tunnels develop their own microclimate, containing warm, moist air, with low oxygen levels. Most digging occurs after rainfall, since dry soil is too difficult to excavate. Because they live in arid environments, this means that Damaraland mole-rats can be extremely active over short periods; a typical colony has been estimated to excavate three tons of soil over a two-week period.
The burrow system consists primarily of foraging tunnels, which the rats dig in search of food. While particularly large tubers and bulbs are at least partially eaten where they are found, smaller ones are dragged to food storage chambers beneath the foraging tunnels. The foraging tunnels are typically only beneath the soil surface, but are connected to a smaller number of deep tunnels that lead down to the storage chambers, latrines, and a central nest that may be as much as underground.
Each burrow system is inhabited by a single colony of mole rats, typically with about twelve members, although colonies can range from as little as two to as many as forty members. The colony is eusocial, consisting of a single breeding pair and their non-reproductive offspring. The non-reproductive members of the colony spend their time foraging and maintaining the tunnel system, in particular closing any breaches that may occur. Intruders from other colonies are generally rejected, although DNA paternity studies show that at least some non-reproductive members of a colony may have been fathered by outsiders. The colony has a clearly defined hierarchy, with the breeding male dominant, followed by the breeding female, then non-reproductive males, and finally non-reproductive females.
Colonies fragment if the breeding female dies, with most surviving members dispersing to new locations. Particularly large individuals may also leave the colony to establish a new burrow system. In such cases, dispersal usually only occurs during rainy weather, ensuring that digging will be relatively easy once a suitable location has been found. New colonies are established by unrelated males and females, which become the new breeding pair. Dispersing individuals travel above ground, and are therefore vulnerable to predation from a wide range of animals; some studies have shown that only around 10 percent of dispersing individuals are later found in new colonies. For example, while small groups of siblings may sometimes leave a burrow system at the same time, normally only one survives to found a new colony.
The Damaraland mole-rat is less vocal than the naked mole-rat, making only some birdlike chirps.
Reproduction.
As eusocial animals, only the breeding pair within a colony is capable of reproduction. Non-reproductive individuals are not truly sterile, however, and become capable of reproduction if they establish a colony of their own. The reproductive systems of non-reproductive females are underdeveloped, with small, unvascularised uteri and tiny ovaries that contain undeveloped germ cells, but which are incapable of ovulation. Non-reproductive males have smaller testes than their reproductive counterparts and produce little, if any, viable sperm. The non-reproductive status of other adults is maintained by the presence of the breeding female. While her removal causes previously non-reproductive females to become fully fertile, they will only mate with unrelated males, thus avoiding incest within the colony.
The breeding female initiates courtship by calling and drumming with her hind feet. The pair then chase each other in a right circle before mating. Mating occurs frequently over a ten-day period, and gestation lasts 78 to 92 days. Females can produce up to three litters of one to six pups per year. The pups are initially hairless, with closed eyes, and only weigh . They are weaned after 28 days, and reach adult size after around 14 months.
Genetics.
The Damaraland mole-rat's karyotype shows 74 or 78 chromosomes (2n). Its fundamental number is 92.

Non Sung district

Non Sung (, ; , ) is a district ("amphoe") in the central part of Nakhon Ratchasima province, northeastern Thailand.
Etymology.
The old name of the district was "Klang". The word "klang" in Thai means 'middle', which refers to the location of the district between the Nok District (now Bua Yai District) and Nai District (Mueang Nakhon Ratchasima District).
When Thai people had to choose a family name at the beginning of the 20th century, many of the locals created names with the word "klang".
History.
The district's name was changed from Non Wat to Non Sung in 1939.
Geography.
Neighbouring districts are (from the north clockwise) Khong, Phimai, Chakkarat, Chaloem Phra Kiat, Mueang Nakhon Ratchasima, Non Thai, and Kham Sakaesaeng.
Ban Non Wat, a village in the district, is an important Bronze Age archaeological site.
Administration.
The district is divided into 16 sub-districts ("tambons"). There are seven townships ("thesaban tambons") within the district: Non Sung covers "tambon" Non Sung; Talat Khae covers parts of "tambon" Than Prasat; Don Wai covers "tambon" Don Wai; Makha covers "tambon" Makha; Dan Khla covers "tambon" Dan Khla; Mai covers "tambon" Mai; and Ho Kham covers "tambon" Ho Kham.

Edmund Jenings (governor)

Edmund Jenings (1659-1727) was an English lawyer and colonial administrator who held important posts in the colony of Virginia including as the attorney general, on the Governor's Council and as acting governor, but encountered controversy and experienced financial problems in his final years.
Early life and education.
His father Sir Edmund Jenings was a barrister and Member of Parliament from Ripon in Yorkshire, England. In the 16th century, Jenings had traditionally worked as stewards for the Barons Clifford and Earl of Cumberland. His mother Margaret was the daughter of Sir Edward Barkham, 1st Baronet, of South Acre, and wife Frances Berney, and granddaughter of Sir Edward Barkham, a merchant who became the lord mayor of London in 1621-1622, and wife Jane Crouch. Edmund was their third son. His elder brother Jonathan became M.P. for Ripon, and this Edmund named his Virginia plantation "Ripon Hall". His great-grandfather Peter Jenings who died in 1651 in Silsden, Yorkshire, England was the brother of William Jenings of Silsden, whose son Capt. Peter Jenings (1630-1672) was the second attorney general for the Virginia colony (in 1670-1671). The Silsden Peter Jenings had three sons but both elder sons (Peter and Edmund) died unmarried and without children, in 1623 and 1624. This Edmund was descended from the third son, Jonathan, who was a barrister and who died in 1649, shortly before his father.
Career.
Emigrating to Virginia when perhaps 20 years old, Jenings settled in York County near the colonial capital (which moved from Jamestown to Williamsburg during his service as discussed below). Appointed the colony's attorney general in 1680 (accounts differ as to whether Jenings arrived with a commission from England or a simple letter of introduction), he continued to serve until at least 1691 and possibly until 1700, with interruptions, as discussed below. Appointed to the Virginia Governor's Council in 1681, Jenings may have continued to serve until shortly before his death, although some scholars believe he was deposed during trips to England, and he was clearly involved in controversies during his final years.
Colonial officer to governor.
As attorney general, one of Jening's responsibilities remained resolving the aftermath of Bacon's Rebellion, nearly a decade earlier. Jenings did so in part by not confiscating the estates of all former rebels after their deaths, but allowing them be left in the hands of their nearest relatives.
In 1684-1685 Jenings accompanied Col. William Byrd, Virginia Governor Lord Howard of Effingham, New York Governor Col. Thomas Dongan, Ralph Wormeley Jr., Stevens V. Courtland, John Spragg, and magistrates from Albany, New York to negotiate with the Seneca. This negotiation helped secure a treaty with the Senecas and other northern tribes. In 1696, when Wormeley was having difficulties fulfilling his duties as the colony's secretary of state, Jenings was named his deputy. On January 1, 1702, the King's Council formally named Jenings as the Colony's Secretary. But it was not until Wormeley's death that Jenings presented his commission to the Virginia governor's council, on June 20, 1702. The following year he was given leave to go to England a second time, and as in the two previous years, petitioned the House of Burgesses to receive the commissions owed him for issuing appointments as that job required. William Cocke received the royal warrant as the colonial secretary in 1712, but when Cocke died in 1720, Jenings again was appointed the colony's secretary, this time by Lt. Gov. Alexander Spotswood.
Jenings may have become a member of the Governor's Council as early as 1684, but the next April the Council ruled that if Jenings was a member of that body, he had to resign as attorney general, and no evidence exists that he did so, and in fact received some payments for his legal work. The English government revised its colonial structure and in 1696 created the Board of Trade to handle colonial relations. About the same time, the House of Burgesses decided to move the colony's capital from Jamestown (notoriously unhealthy in summers) to Williamsburg, and Jenings clearly supervised much of the transition in 1699-1700, though the capacity in which he did so is unclear. Moreover, one of his legal jobs was to compile the colony's laws for transmission to the Board of Trade, and the Speaker of the House of Burgesses found the result inadequate in 1699, and so did not appoint Jenings to that committee until one of the original committeemen (Edward Hill) died. Thus, some accounts list Jenings as becoming a councilor in 1699 or 1701. Another controversy involved whether Jenings overstayed his leave during trips to England, particularly an extended trip in 1704-1705 in which he met with the Board of Trade in London, or another trip in 1711 in which he met with Lady Fairfax and was named as agent for the Northern Neck Proprietary (together with Thomas Lee replacing Robert Carter from 1713 to 1719).,
Meanwhile, as the member of the Governor's Council with longest service, Jenings eventually became President of the Council of Virginia. Thus when Col. Edward Nott died in office and his successor Col. Robert Hunter was captured at sea by the French, Jenings became the acting governor from August 1706 to June 1710, but declined a second term at the end of his life citing feeble health. Jenings did not call the House of Burgesses into session during his time as acting Governor, and showed little initiative before the arrival of Gov. Alexander Spotswood. In 1710, while lieutenant governor, Jenings became involved in a case involving two slaves who had organized a rebellion, and declared afterward that their execution "will strike such terror" in others not to rebel.
Jenings' most recent biographer details the factional strife in Virginia in the early 19th century, in which Jenings was perceived as too strenuously defending Gov. Francis Nicholson and part of a faction including Ralph Wormeley Jr. and Richard Lee II, and opposed by several powerful councilors, particularly Robert Carter, Rev. James Blair and Benjamin Harrison II. Furthermore, part of Jenings' second trip to England involved not only burying his wife, but setting the estate of an elder brother, which did not yield the money Jenings expected, and needed given his borrowing from the Northern Neck proprietary accounts. In any event, when Lady Fairfax died in May 1719, her executor (re) appointed Robert Carter as the new agent, and Carter soon charged Jenings with failing to transmit the quitrents due to the proprietor in England. John Carter his son then persuaded Jenings to mortgage his lands to raise the money due to Lord Fairfax, as he informed the proprietor in 1722. Two years later, Robert Carter wrote the Fairfax representative that all Jenings' land and slaves were mortgaged. When Robert Carter died, his will (dated in 1728, after this man's death) mentioned a judgment against Jenings by the General Court in chancery. In any event, several high-ranking Virginians accused Jenings of mental illness in his final year, so he may have resigned from the council in March 1725. Lt. Gov. Drysdale shortly after he announced that he was returning to England, formally removed Jenings from the council, on June 25, 1726. Thus, when Drysdale died on July 22, 1726, Robert Carter became the colony's acting governor for about a year.
Planter and land speculator.
Jenings speculated in land in the Virginia colony, and also grew and shipped tobacco, using enslaved labor by at least his final years, although many records have been lost. Virginia's last colonial capital, Williamsburg, in whose platting this man had significant involvement, before becoming chartered as a town in its own right was split down main street between York County and James City County, Virginia. In 1686 Jenings was among the prominent men who asked to patent land on Pamunkey Neck (now in King William County) when such was legally available (a previous treaty with the Pamunkey having restricted resettlement), and the following year he purchased a mill on St. Andrews Creek in York County. In October 1691 Jenings patented 6,513 acres in Henrico County on Tuckahoe Creek and the James River. When the town of Yorktown was planned, about 12 miles downstream on the York River from Jenings's main Ripon Hall plantation, Jenings secured a town lot with building. The following year he was among the Council members ordered to build a house in Jamestown. In 1696 he and his wife sold land farmed by a tenant in Hampton parish (probably in Elizabeth City County. In 1706 Jenings was awarded 4,000 acres in King William County upstream of York County in recognition of his service to the crown. Thus that year Jenings paid taxes on 200 acres in James City County, 4000 acres in King William County and 1500 acres in York County.
Local offices.
Among the local offices Jenings held were: the James City County sheriff in 1681, clerk of York County, one of the churchwarden of Bruton parish in 1791, and at some point probably in the early 1700s the commander in chief of the York County militia, with the rank of colonel. Jenings also grew and shipped large quantities of tobacco and was collector of customs for the James River's Upper District (which included Henrico County).
Personal life.
Edmund married Frances, the daughter of Henry Corbin of Buckingham House, and wife Alice Eltonhead, and had several children. Frances died in London in 1713 and is likely buried at St. Clement's Dane's. His son and grandson were also named "Edmund Jenings" and both returned to England before their deaths. Edmund Jenings Jr. (d. 1756) married the twice-widowed Adriana Vanderheyden Frisby Bordley (1690-1741), became a noted Maryland lawyer and politician who served in both houses of the Maryland legislature and had a primary residence in the state capital and properties in diverse areas including Baltimore and Prince George's and Charles counties (also serving as clerk of the latter). While his son Peter died before reaching adulthood, the other son Edmund Jenings III (1731-1819) (this man's grandson, and a daughter and her husband) returned to the mother country around the time of the American Revolutionary War, practiced at Lincoln's Inn and died in Yorkshire. Edmund Jenings III also traveled back to the colonies and presented a portrait of the Earl of Chatham to the Gentlemen of Westmoreland County, Virginia in 1769. This man's daughter, Elizabeth Jenings also returned to Yorkshire, and married Robert Porteus. He son (this man's grandson) was Beilby Porteus, Bishop of Chester and London. Two other daughters remained in Virginia: Frances, who married future burgess Charles Grymes, and Margaret, who married Issac Hill in 1708). Their brother William Jenings also moved to Maryland. His great-grandson (son of Edmund Jr.'s daughter also named Ariana) was Edmund Randolph, who became Governor of Virginia and the first Attorney General of the United States under George Washington. However, his relation to Thomas Jennings (1736-1796) who became Maryland's attorney general is unclear.
Death and legacy.
In early June 1726, John Randolph visited Jenings and found him suffering from a palsy, likely a stroke or Parkinson's disease, barely able to write, and composing his thoughts only with difficulty. However, when William Robertson as the council's clerk informed Jenings he was being removed for incompetence, Jenings resisted. Various accounts of Jenings' death place it in England on December 5, 1727 (which is unlikely given that Robert Carter of Virginia wrote the Board of Trade about the death on July 24, 1727), or at Ripon Hall on June 2 or July 5. He was buried at Bruton Parish Church, which he had helped build, and modern excavation of the worn tombstone indicates a date of "Ju-- 1727".
After Jenings' death, creditor Robert Carter I foreclosed on the mortgage and took over Jenings' main Ripon Hall plantation. Another major creditor was Thomas Corbin, his brother in law. A plaque commemorating Jenings was placed at Bruton Church in 1907, but neither his last will and testament nor other personal papers have survived.

Shibayama Yahachi

Baron was an admiral in the early Imperial Japanese Navy.
Biography.
Born in Kagoshima, Satsuma domain, (present day Kagoshima prefecture), Shibayama participated as a Satsuma "samurai" in the Anglo-Satsuma War in his youth. Although a close friend of Togo Heihachiro, he declined to join the military and did not participate in the Boshin War to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate. However, after the Meiji Restoration, and the establishment of the new Meiji government in Tokyo he enrolled in the government's development and colonization program, and was sent to the United States for two years from 1872.
On Shibayama's return to Japan, he entered the fledgling Imperial Japanese Navy as a naval artillery specialist. He fought in the Satsuma Rebellion in an artillery battalion, and served briefly as a crewman on the and . He was in charge of torpedo development from 1879–1883, and is called the “father of the Japanese torpedo”.
Promoted to captain in 1885, Shibayama went to the United States and Europe in 1886 together with Saigō Tsugumichi, and on his return was promoted to acting director of the Armaments Department within the Ministry of the Navy of Japan, much to the outrage and opposition of Admiral Yamamoto Gonnohyōe. Perhaps for this reason, he was given command of the corvette "Tsukuba" on 15 May 1889 and sent to sea for two years. Afterwards, he was assigned command of , the cruiser , Yokosuka Naval District, and the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy before being appointed commander-in-chief of the Sasebo Naval District.
Shibayama was promoted to rear admiral on 30 July 1894 in time for the First Sino-Japanese War. He became vice admiral and commander-in-chief of the Readiness Fleet on 10 August 1897.
He was commander-in-chief of the Kure Naval District from 20 May 1900, through the end of the Russo-Japanese War.
After the war, on 7 January 1905, he became commander-in-chief of the new Ryojun Naval District. It was here that his abilities as an administrator and as an engineer found their perfect match. Shibayama was instrumental in raising the sunken Russian Pacific Fleet from the bottom of Port Arthur harbor, salvaging the badly damaged warships, and placing them into service with the Imperial Japanese Navy. Shibayama was promoted to full admiral on 13 November 1905 and elevated to the rank of "danshaku" (baron) under the "kazoku" peerage system on 21 September 1907.
Shibayama went into the reserves in 1915 and retired completely in 1920. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Tokyo.

The first issue appeared in March 1979. Vivian Barning has been a card collector as a child, and came back to the hobby with her husband in 1975. For most of its run, it appeared in a newspaper-style format, although it later converted to a tabloid size with a color cover.
The magazine primarily focussed on baseball cards, but also included coverage of many other baseball-related collectibles, including autographs, press pins, postcards, stamps, uniforms and other pieces of game-used equipment, and books and other publications. As its name implies, the paper placed an emphasis on news, offering extensive coverage of newly released cards and memorabilia, as well as reporting on developments within the hobby itself. It also featured more nostalgic pieces, including articles on older memorabilia as well as interviews with baseball players of the past. There were also frequent articles aimed at new collectors, offering advice on how to get started in the hobby.
The publication originally was based in Glen Cove, New York. It moved to San Diego, California, in 1982. The Barnings wrote many articles themselves, but also used contributions from a growing staff of writers and columnists.
In 1982 the packaging of Fleer's baseball card set touted that their 1981 set had been named the best of the year by Baseball Hobby News.

Mueang Yasothon district

Mueang Yasothon (, ) is the capital district of Yasothon province in northeastern Thailand on the Chi River. Sub-district Nai Mueang (, 'in the town') defines the city limits of the town of Yasothon.
History.
According to the chronicles of Mueang Yasothon, in 1795 Phra Chao Worawongsa (Phra Wo), Minister of Vientiane, and several others set off to live with the king of Champassak. Along the way they came to a jungle where spirits dwelt, and seeing that it was a good place, they built a village there next to the grounds of an abandoned wat. They called it "Wat Singh Tha" (), which remains to this day. The village they called "Ban Singh Tha" (). Singh is a mythical lion; "tha" () means 'pose'. A marker for a chedi erected by Wat Singh Tha says that, during the Thonburi Period, grandson Kham Su () called the settlement Ban Singh Thong (). The wat, which had been deserted with dense jungle blocking the way to the river landing, was re-built and renamed after the new village. The change from "thong" ('gold') to "tha" () was influenced by two factors: "tha" means 'port' or 'landing' and also means 'pose' with many connotations. Thus the change in name to "Singh Tha" means 'port lion' and also 'imposing lion' such as those posed on the Lion Gate, and on pedestals on the temple grounds.
In 1814, King Rama II renamed Ban Singh Tha to Yasothon and raised its status to "mueang".
Yasothon was the national winner of the World Wildlife Fund's 2018 "One Planet City Challenge". The municipality was lauded for its efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, by means of recycling efforts and transport initiatives.
Geography.
Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Sai Mun, Kut Chum, Pa Tio and Kham Khuean Kaeo of Yasothon Province; Phanom Phrai and Selaphum of Roi Et province.
Administration.
The district is divided into 18 sub-districts ("tambons"), which are further subdivided into 190 villages ("muban"). The town ("thesaban mueang") Yasothon covers the entire "tambon" Nai Mueang. There are a further 17 tambon administrative organizations (TAO).

Port state control

Port state control (PSC) is an inspection regime for countries to inspect foreign-registered ships in port other than those of the flag state and take action against ships that are not in compliance. Inspectors for PSC are called PSC officers (PSCOs), and are required to investigate compliance with the requirements of international conventions, such as SOLAS, MARPOL, STCW, and the MLC. Inspections can involve checking that the vessel is crewed and operated in compliance with applicable international law, and verifying the competency of the ship's master and officers, and the ship's condition and equipment.
History.
In 1978, a number of European countries agreed in The Hague on a memorandum for the audit of labour conditions on board vessels as to whether they were in accordance with the rules of the ILO. After the "Amoco Cadiz" sank that year, it was decided to also audit safety and pollution practices. To this end, in 1982 fourteen European countries agreed on the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MoU) to establish port state control. Currently, 26 European countries and Canada are signatories of Paris MoU. PSC was a reaction to the failure of those flag states especially flag of convenience states that had delegated their survey and certification responsibilities to classification societies.
Modeled on the Paris MOU, several other regional MOUs have been signed, including the Tokyo MOU (Pacific Ocean), Acuerdo Latino or Acuerdo de Viña del Mar (South and Central America), the Caribbean MOU, the Mediterranean MOU, the Indian Ocean MOU, the Abuja MOU (West and Central Atlantic Africa), the Black Sea MOU, and the Riyadh MOU (Persian Gulf).
Inspection and enforcement.
The port state control (PSC) makes inspection of ships in port, taken by a port state control officer (PSCO). Annual report of Paris MoU reported that a total of 74,713 deficiencies were recorded during port state control inspections in 2007, which deficiencies resulted in 1,250 detentions that year. Detention of the ship is the last course of action that a PSCO would take upon finding deficiencies aboard the vessel.
Courses of action a PSCO may impose on a ship with deficiencies (in order of ascending gravity) are:
Jurisdiction.
The countries that implement PSC are referred to as port states. This term was established in UNCLOS, but the approach had been applied since ancient times.
Port states effectively establish jurisdiction over foreign-flagged seagoing vessels visiting the ports of a port state. This jurisdiction is distinct from the one set up by the coastal states in their maritime zones, primarily due to two considerations:
Port states can, in addition to detention, sanction violations with fines. Port states can also in certain cases, for example if a ship violates the 0.5% sulphur limit of MARPOL Annex VI, assert jurisdiction for such violations which occur on the high seas. The extraterritorial jurisdictional basis for such enforcement and sanctioning is found within the special provisions of part XII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

West Elk Mountains

The West Elk Mountains are a high mountain range in the west-central part of the U.S. state of Colorado. They lie primarily within the Gunnison National Forest, and part of the range is protected as the West Elk Wilderness. The range is primarily located in Gunnison County, with small parts in eastern Delta and Montrose counties.
The West Elks are surrounded by tributaries of the Gunnison River. The range is bounded on the north by the North Fork of the Gunnison and on the east by the East River, another tributary of the Gunnison. On the south and west it is contiguous with Black Mesa and Fruitland Mesa, both part of the uplift in which sits the Black Canyon of the Gunnison. On the northeast it is contiguous with the Elk Mountains, being separated from them by Anthracite Creek and Coal Creek. Nearby towns include Gunnison, Paonia, and the ski resort of Crested Butte.
Geology.
The northern and southern West Elk Mountains have contrasting geologic histories and surface features. In the north, the prominent peaks are laccoliths, formed when magma intruded into Mancos Shale about 30 million years go. Since then, the overlying Mesozoic sedimentary rock, including the relatively soft Mancos Shale, has eroded away, exposing the laccoliths. Laccoliths in the West Elk Mountains include Marcellina Mountain, Mount Gunnison, East Beckwith Mountain, the Anthracite Range, Mount Axtell, Carbon Peak, and Whetstone Mountain.
In contrast, volcanic rocks dominate the southern portion of the range. Shortly after the laccolith intrusions in the north, volcanic activity began to the south. A large stratovolcano and other vents ejected material that accumulated over what is now the southern West Elk Mountains. Most of these volcanic rocks are included in the West Elk Breccia Formation, a heterogeneous collection of volcanic materials including extensive mudflow deposits. West Elk Breccia is in places over thick.
On top of the West Elk Breccia, volcanic ash was deposited through repeated eruptions in the San Juan volcanic field to the south. Most of the ash was deposited 26 to 27 million years ago. The resulting rock, tuff, is relatively soft, but the ash landing toward the southern edge of the West Elk volcanic field was hot enough to fuse into harder welded tuff. These welded tuffs are more resistant to weathering than the underlying breccia and today they cap multiple south-sloping mesas in the southern West Elk Mountains.
Erosion has cut valleys and defined the mesas and peaks we see today. The highest point in the West Elk Mountains is West Elk Peak, which is located near the center of the large volcano that once dominated this landscape. Stratigraphic profiles of these rock layers can be seen at the southern edge of the West Elk Mountains where the Gunnison River has eroded through the volcanic strata. A good example can be seen at the Dillion Pinnacles in Curecanti National Recreation Area. The resistant welded tuff that caps Dillon Mesa is on top, overlying the West Elk Breccia, which has eroded into the pinnacles. Exposed under the breccia are the older, underlying Mesozoic sedimentary rocks including the Mancos, Dakota, and Morrison Formations.

Edward Tyson

Edward Tyson (20 January 1651 – 1 August 1708) was an English scientist and physician. He is commonly regarded as the founder of modern comparative anatomy, which compares the anatomy between species.
Biography.
Tyson was born the son of Edward Tyson at Clevedon, in Somerset. He became a BA from Oxford on 8 February 1670, an MA from Oxford on 4 November 1673, and an MD from Cambridge in 1678. He was admitted to the College of Physicians on 30 September 1680 and as a Fellow in April 1683. In 1684 he was appointed physician and governor to the Bethlem Hospital in London (the first mental hospital in Britain and the second in Europe). He is credited with changing the hospital from a zoo of sorts to a place intended to assist its inmates. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November 1679. He is buried at St Dionis Backchurch.
Anatomical research.
In 1680, Tyson studied a porpoise and established that it is a mammal. He noted that the convoluted structures of the brains were closer to those of land quadrupeds than those of fish. In 1698, he dissected a chimpanzee on display at the London docks, and as a result wrote a book, "". In the book he came to the conclusion that the chimpanzee has more in common with man than with monkeys, particularly with respect to its brain. This work was republished in 1894 with an introduction by Bertram C. A. Windle and a short biography of Tyson.
Tyson dissected a timber rattlesnake in 1683 and produced one of the earliest and most accurate descriptions of the internal anatomy of snakes. He was the first to describe the loreal pits of the Crotalinae. Tyson however did not recognize its heat-sensing function, thinking it was a hearing organ.

Philotheca

Philotheca is a genus of about fifty species of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. Plants in this genus are shrubs with simple leaves arranged alternately along the stems, flowers that usually have five sepals, five petals and ten stamens that curve inwards over the ovary. All species are endemic to Australia and there are species in every state, but not the Northern Territory.
Description.
Plants in the genus "Philotheca" are shrubs that are either glabrous or have tiny, simple hairs. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, narrow oblong to almost cylindrical and sessile or on a very short petiole. From a single to many flowers are arranged in leaf axils or on the ends of the branchlets. The flowers have five sepals and five petals (except in "P. virgata" which has four). The sepals are free from each other and the petals usually overlap at their bases. There are ten stamens that curve inwards over the ovary with anthers that have an appendage called the "apiculum". The ovary contains five carpels fused near their bases. The seeds are long and are released explosively from their capsule.
Taxonomy and naming.
The genus "Philotheca" was first formally described in 1816 by Edward Rudge from a specimen collected near Port Jackson and the description was published in "Transactions of the Linnean Society of London". The first species Rudge described was "P. australis" but this name is considered a nomen illegitimum and a taxonomic synonym of "Philotheca salsolifolia" by the Australian Plant Census.
The name "Philotheca" should have been written "Psilotheca" after the Ancient Greek words "psilos" meaning "bare", "smooth", "bald" or "naked" and "theke" meaning "case", "container", "envelope" or "sheath", referring to "the smooth tube of the stamens".
Many plants formerly in "Eriostemon" are now in this genus.
Distribution.
Plants in the genus "Philotheca" are found in every state of Australia, but not in the Northern Territory.
Species.
The following is a list of "Philotheca" species accepted by the Australian Plant Census as at April 2019:

Adam Braidwood

Adam Braidwood (born June 1, 1984) is a Canadian professional boxer, actor, martial artist and retired professional football defensive end.
He spent the entirety of his professional football career with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, having started with the team in 2006.
Early career.
While attending Seaquam Secondary School in Delta, Braidwood got his start in major football competition when he attended Washington State University, making their football squad as a true freshman in 2002 (and making the conference all-freshman team). Over the course of his collegiate career, Braidwood recorded 13.5 sacks, 8.5 of which came in his senior year where he started all thirteen games and was among the top ten in the Pacific-10 conference in tackles.
Professional football career.
Braidwood was drafted first overall by the Edmonton Eskimos in the 2006 Canadian College Draft. Despite playing college football in the United States, as a Canadian-born player he was considered a non-import under CFL roster rules.
At 6'4" and 250 pounds, Braidwood was known for his strength on the outside. He is the two-time winner of the strongest man award at Washington State. He recorded his first professional touchdown on September 8, 2006, recovering a fumble from Calgary Stampeders quarterback Henry Burris and taking it into the endzone during the rematch of the Labour Day Classic in Edmonton.
Professional boxing career.
Braidwood has been ranked as the number one heavyweight in Western Canada and the ninth ranked overall with and The Firm Sports Management. In 2009, Braidwood defeated Devon Garnon by KO. More recently, December 2015, the former Edmonton Eskimo fought Paul MacKenzie (P-Mac), defeating him by TKO.
In March 2016, Braidwood's fight against Victor Välimäki came to a decision at the end of the third round. Since then, the heavyweight has consistently won by TKO, maintaining an almost-perfect record of wins by TKO in 2016. In June 2016, Braidwood defeated Todd Stoute by KO at 3:00 of round 2. Braidwood added another win to his record in September 2016, when he knocked out Adam Queried at 2:30 of the first round. Again, Braidwood emerged victorious over Lee Mein at 2:07 in the first round on December 2, 2016, in Edmonton, AB . This year, Braidwood has racked up four more victories, making him the number one heavyweight in Western Canada.
Braidwood defeated Eric Martel Bahoeli on February 24, 2017, to win the WBU Heavyweight Title, in Quebec City making him the number one heavyweight boxer of the WBU. Bahoeli was ranked seventh (11-6-1) at the time of the fight in World Boxing Union (WBU) ranks . The 12-round title fight lasted a total of 5 rounds (2:50), before finally knocking him out. In the 4th round, Braidwood sustained a large cut above one of his eyes from a series of seconds in which he taunted Bahoeli to "hit me harder." It was a violent matchup, but it is no surprise that Braidwood emerged victorious, as he packs one of the heaviest punches in the league.
On June 16, 2017, he competed against Tim Hague in Edmonton. Hague suffered a serious brain injury in the fight, and died two days later in a nearby hospital.
Legal troubles.
On November 23, 2010, Braidwood and two other men were charged after an incident late the previous Friday afternoon in Spruce Grove, Alberta.
On April 19, 2013, Braidwood was sentenced to 4 1/2 years for sexually assaulting a former girlfriend.
On September 10, 2013, Braidwood pleaded guilty to other remaining Alberta charges and sentencing proceeded. The sentence ran concurrently with his other convictions.
In June 2018, Braidwood was arrested and charged for assaulting a girlfriend and parole violations. He served four months in prison and was released October 2018.
In June 2019, Braidwood was charged for domestic assault and forcible confinement to another girlfriend. On July 6, 2020 he pleaded guilty to assault charges.
In December 2019, Braidwood violated parole conditions of no contact and was arrested and charged with breach of parole and intimidation of justice. On November 25, 2020, he pleaded guilty to charges.

Phillip Willis

Phillip LaFrance Willis (August 2, 1918 – January 27, 1995) was a World War II veteran and a witness to the assassination of President Kennedy who testified before the Warren Commission.
Early life and military service.
Phillip Willis was born in Kaufman County, Texas, the son of Alvin Samuel Willis, a school teacher, and Eliza Jane Phillips. He had a brother, Doyle.
On December 7, 1941, Willis was stationed at Bellows Field on Oahu, Hawaii as a second lieutenant assigned to the 86th Observation Squadron of the United States Army Air Forces. He was present at the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and has been credited with leading the patrol that captured the United States' first Japanese prisoner of war in World War II, Kazuo Sakamaki. Willis flew observation and fighter aircraft, as well as combat missions in the B-17 bomber, prior to retiring in 1946 due to a back injury he sustained after being shot down over the Pacific Ocean. He received various awards and decorations for his military service including two Silver Stars and a Distinguished Flying Cross.
After retiring from military service, Willis earned a bachelor's degree in government at North Texas State Teachers College in 1948. He was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1946 and 1948. As of 1995, Phillip Willis and Doyle Willis were the only brothers to have served at the same time in the Texas House. Afterwards, he worked in real estate, building civil defense shelters, and became an automobile dealer. Willis moved to Dallas in 1960.
Willis was married to Marilyn Willis, and the couple had two daughters, Linda and Rosemary.
Witness to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
Willis was present in Dealey Plaza during the assassination of Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Standing near the curb at the corner of Houston and Elm Streets, he took a series of color slides with his Argus Autronic I Model 35156-M immediately before, during, and after the assassination. Willis appears in the Zapruder film until frame #206, just prior to Kennedy disappearing from view behind the Stemmons Freeway sign.
During the assassination, Willis snapped a 35mm color slide (the fifth of twenty-seven he captured in Dealey Plaza that day) showing the presidential limousine and its occupants, the United States Secret Service agents' follow-up car and occupants, parade onlookers, and the grassy knoll visible in the background.
Testimony and aftermath.
On July 22, 1964, Willis provided testimony to Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the Warren Commission, at the Post Office Building in Dallas.
Twelve of Willis's color slides with descriptions served as "Willis Exhibit 1" for the Warren Commission. Willis testified to the Commission that his fifth photo was inadvertently snapped when, just after he had prepared his 35mm Argus camera to capture a photo, he was suddenly startled by a gunshot related noise (the first of three shots he remembered hearing), and his finger that was already on the camera shutter button reacted to the gunshot related noise, then, he quickly depressed the button and the fifth photo was captured. As documented by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, this fifth photo was captured concurrent with Zapruder film frame 202.
In his fifth photo, some conspiracists allege that the image of a still-unknown person can be seen located up on the grassy knoll, seen near a 3-foot-tall concrete wall and near the 5-foot-tall stockade fence. The angled shape of this still-unknown person's outline has led to that person's image being labeled by authors in books and persons working in the Kennedy assassination research community the "black dog man".
In 1978, when Willis's daughter Rosemary was interviewed by investigators from the House Select Committee on Assassinations, she stated to the HSCA that her father became upset when the Dallas policemen, sheriffs, and detectives—who first quickly ran onto the grassy knoll where Phillip thought the shots came from—then ran away from the grassy knoll. In Willis's Warren Commission testimony he stated that shots came from the Texas School Book Depository.
Willis stated in a 1979 interview: "There's no doubt in our mind the final shot that blew his head off did not come from the depository. His head blew up like a halo. The brains and matter went to the left and the rear.'
Later life.
On January 27, 1995, Willis died of leukemia at his home in Dallas. The Texas House passed a resolution to honor him.

Semi-trailer

A semi-trailer is a trailer without a front axle. The combination of a semi-trailer and a tractor truck is called a "semi-trailer truck" (also known simply as a "semi-trailer", "tractor trailer", or "semi" in the United States).
A large proportion of a semi-trailer's weight is supported by a tractor unit, or a detachable front-axle assembly known as a dolly, or the tail of another trailer. The semi-trailer's weight is semi-supported (half-supported) by its own wheels, at the rear of the semi-trailer. A semi-trailer is normally equipped with landing gear (legs which can be lowered) to support it when it is uncoupled. Many semi-trailers have wheels that are capable of being totally dismounted and are also relocatable (repositionable) to better distribute load to bearing wheel weight factors. Semi-trailers are more popular for transport than full trailers, which have both front and rear axles. Ease of backing is cited as one of the semi's chief advantages. A road tractor coupled to a semi-trailer is often called a semi-trailer truck or "semi" in North America and Australia, and an articulated lorry or "artic" in the UK.
Semi-trailers with two trailer units are called B-doubles (Australian English) or tandem tractor-trailers, tandem rigs, or doubles (American English). Other terms used are "B-train" or (when there are three or more trailers) "road train". A double-trailer combination is possible with the use of a dolly, or "converter dolly" (Australian and American English), essentially one to three additional axles placed under the front of a second semi-trailer. The first semi-trailer is connected to the power unit using the tractor's fifth wheel coupling while the converter dolly, already attached to the second semi-trailer, is connected to the first semi-trailer with a drawbar. In Australian English, the tractor unit is called a "prime-mover", and the combination of a prime-mover and trailer is known as a "semi-trailer", "semi" or single. Some popular manufacturers of tractor trucks are Kenworth, Iveco, Freightliner, MAN, Scania, Mercedes-Benz, DAF, Renault Trucks, Volvo, Peterbilt, Mack and Western Star.
Properties.
Semi-trailers were invented by August Fruehauf in 1914.
Road tractors and semi-trailers are responsible for carrying a large proportion of cargo. With 1,170,117 million tonne-kilometers transported this way in the European Union, including the UK, road tractors and semi-trailers are 77.6% of the total tonne-kilometers transported in 2015, according to Eurostat.
In road haulage, semi-trailers predominate over full trailers because of their flexibility. The trailers can be coupled and uncoupled quickly, allowing them to be shunted for loading and to be trucked between depots. If a power unit fails, another tractor can replace it without disturbing the cargo.
Compared with a full trailer, a semi-trailer attached to a tractor unit is easier to reverse, since it has only one turning point (the coupling), whereas a full trailer has two turning points (the coupling and the drawbar attachment). Special tractors are known as shunt trucks or shuttle trucks can easily maneuver semi-trailers at a depot or loading and unloading ferries. These tractors may lift the coupling so the trailer legs clear the ground.
A rigid truck and full trailer are articulated inside the cargo area length, so a semi-trailer can have a longer continuous cargo area. Because of this, a semi-trailer can haul longer objects, (logs, pipe, beams, railway track). This depends on the legislation; in some European countries, a full trailer can be as long as a semi-trailer. However, since a rigid truck is longer than a semi-tractor, this increases the overall length of the combination, making it less maneuverable.
For heavy haulage or for increased manoeuvrability, some semi-trailers are fitted with rear-wheel steering, controlled electro-hydraulically. 
The wheels on all or some of the rear axles may be turned through different angles to enable tighter cornering, or through the same angle (so-called 'crab' steering) to move the rear of the trailer laterally.
Couplings.
The two types of couplings are fifth-wheel coupling and automatic. In some applications, no separable coupling is fitted, and the trailer is bolted to the tractor unit, using a bearing, and rocker feet as are used under a fifth wheel skid plate.
Fifth-wheel coupling.
The towing vehicle has a wide coupling plate known as a fifth-wheel coupling bolted onto its chassis, on which the semi-trailer rests and pivots. As the tractor reverses under the trailer, a kingpin under the front of the trailer slides into a slot in the skid plate, and the jaws of the fifth wheel close onto it. The driver has to raise the trailer legs manually and couple the airbrake lines and electrical cables. Some low-set trailers such as lowboys/low-loaders and car transporters have electrically powered landing gear due to the necessarily low clearance prohibiting conventional landing gear.
Types.
Different types of semi-trailers are designed to haul different cargoes.
Common widths are , and . Generally speaking, most North American type trailers use two axles with dual-tire hubs totaling 8 wheels, while most European type trailers use three axles with single-tire hubs totaling 6 wheels, with one of the axles being able to be lifted for lighter loads and saving on tire, brake, and axle wear. Nearly all sufficiently tall modern trailers are equipped with a rear underride guard to prevent cars from passing beyond the rear edge of the trailer, and most also have side underride guards for the same reason. There are also other smaller differences with regards to kingpin depth, lighting, door locks, et cetera, though most purpose-built tractor trucks can carry most types of trailer regardless of which continent it was built on and the differences therein.
Tank trailer.
A tank trailer is a semi-trailer specifically designed to carry liquids, fluids and gases.

Controversy.
A 16-year-old boy, Ankit, died after taking a plunge into a swimming pool in a Punjabi Bagh club in West Delhi on Tuesday, June 11, 2003. 
The victim was rushed to Agrasen hospital, where he was declared deceased. According to deputy commissioner of police (licensing) G C Dwivedi, the club's licence has been cancelled. "We won't allow swimming in the club until the investigations are completed," said Dwivedi. The incident took place around 7.30 pm. Son of a businessman, Ankit was a student of Hansraj Model school and had passed his Class X examinations this year. He was a regular visitor of the club, the police said. Deputy Commissioner of police (west) Satish Golcha said: "The boy had gone to the pool alone. Five life guards were present on the spot. First-aid equipment was there as well." According to the police, four life guards are deployed in the evening and three in the morning at the pool, which is 16 feet deep. According to sources, there are more than 120 swimming pools in the city with a proper licence. However, the actual number of swimming pools in the city is much more. Additionally, every pool must employ an instructor with adequate knowledge of first aid and artificial respiration. The instructor has to be present till the pool remains open.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the school was involved in a fee-hike row with the Delhi Parents Association, where almost 288 Delhi schools were alleged to have increased their fees for the new academic session.

Mount Butler

Mount Butler or Pat Na Shan (Chinese: 畢拿山) is a 436 m high hill on Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong.
Access.
Hong Kong Trail Stage 5 passes near the summit of Mount Butler. The best place to start the hike to the summit is from the Parkview apartment complex. The trail ascends steeply to Jardine's Lookout, continues to climb, then drops down a set of stairs for 10–15 minutes, then ascends steeply alongside a stone quarry. From the summit the view stretches to Lamma Island, Red Hill and Dragon's Back Trail. The descent from the summit is to Upper Tai Tam Reservoir. From here the hiker has several options, including continuing on to Stage 6 of the Hong Kong Trail, hiking or running to either Violet Hill or the Twins, or hiking out to Repulse Bay. The route has frequent maps, one public bathroom and no water stops so carry sufficient liquids with you.
History.
Canadians fought against the Japanese invaders on Mount Butler during World War II.
On the slopes of Mount Butler, John Robert Osborn of the Winnipeg Grenadiers won the Victoria Cross for his gallantry and sacrifice during the battle. The site of his action is marked by a rock cairn near one of the walk trails.
Others.
A radio station called "Mount Butler H.F. Radio Receiving Station" is situated on nearby Siu Ma Shan, but the name Mount Butler is used nonetheless. Masts of the station can be seen from a distance. It was built in 1996 as part of the system that provides air-to-ground communications and METAR broadcasts for Hong Kong International Airport.

Serge Pizzorno

Sergio Lorenzo "Serge" Pizzorno (born 15 December 1980) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, artist, and record producer. He is best known as the co-founder, guitarist, and second vocalist of the rock band Kasabian, for whom he became the primary songwriter after the departure of Christopher Karloff in 2006 and the sole vocalist following the firing of Tom Meighan in 2020. He is also a member of Loose Tapestries alongside Noel Fielding and fellow Kasabian member Tim Carter, a group put together to produce music for Fielding's TV series "Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy".
Early life.
Sergio Lorenzo Pizzorno was born in Newton Abbot on 15 December 1980. His Italian paternal grandfather moved to England from Genoa and settled in Leicester, where Pizzorno was raised. He has said that the only reason he was born in Newton Abbot is because his mother liked the hospital there. He originally intended to become a footballer, telling his careers adviser that he wanted to be "centre forward for Leicester City". He also began supporting Genoa CFC after his uncle took him to the Luigi Ferraris Stadium when he was visiting the family in Italy as a child.
Career.
Kasabian.
Pizzorno is not fond of Kasabian being compared to similar, older bands, including Oasis and The Stone Roses. He says "The foreign fans listen to the music more and don't call us The Stone Roses or anything. I think they get us for who we are, especially in France and places like that. There's no baggage like in the UK." Pizzorno has also expressed admiration for Damon Albarn, the frontman of Oasis' rival Britpop band Blur.
Despite this, Pizzorno is an admirer of Oasis, in particular former lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. He has said that "at our school, if you played guitar you got beat up for being a ponce. Then Oasis came along and suddenly playing guitar was cool. They inspired a whole generation of bands. When we started out as kids, it was Noel Gallagher who inspired me more than any teacher or historical figure I'd heard about." "For Oasis to ask us to go with them is an honour and a pleasure. I imagine they see a lot of themselves in us and I don't imagine they'd go on tour with a band they didn't like."
Kasabian are consistently referred to as an indie rock band, but, Pizzorno has said "We've never been an indie band, you know, and I sort of fucking hate indie bands." He has referred to the band's music as "future rock".
Following Pizzorno's decision to become the band's frontman after parting ways with Tom Meighan, he prepared for the role by studying his favorite artists such as Tyler, the Creator, Iggy Pop, Björk, PJ Harvey, Liam Howlett and Liam Gallagher.
Other work.
Pizzorno has also worked with former Kasabian lead guitarist and songwriter Chris Karloff on the DJ Shadow track "The Tiger" from the album "The Outsider". He notably scored a fabulous volley in the "Road to Wembley" segment on "Soccer AM".
Pizzorno was at Wembley Stadium in November 2010 to make the draw for the FA Cup third round proper, along with former Oasis guitarist and good friend Noel Gallagher.
In 2010, he composed the music for the movie "London Boulevard", starring Colin Farrell, Ray Winstone and Keira Knightley.
In 2011, Pizzorno joined forces with friend Noel Fielding to create music for his new E4 sketch show "Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy". They formed a project called Loose Tapestries. Together, they also wrote the music for the second series of the show, which aired in 2014.
Pizzorno was one of the celebrities to take part in the 2012 edition of Soccer Aid, a charity football match played by celebrities and ex-footballers, on 27 May. He played for the Rest of the World team against England and scored the opening goal of the game, lobbing former England international goalkeeper David Seaman from a tight angle. Although the Rest of the World went on to lose 3–1, Pizzorno won the Man of the Match award.
He also appears on the album "Beyond Ugly" by Bristol band Malachai.
In May 2019, Pizzorno launched a solo project under the name The S.L.P.; his first single was called "Favourites" and it featured British rapper Little Simz.
Pizzorno is listed as an executive producer on the film "Walk Like a Panther" (2018).
Personal life.
Pizzorno has described experiencing symptoms suggestive of synaesthesia; for example, he once saw a magician's equipment on television, which caused him to smell odours so foul that they triggered his gag reflex and made him lose his appetite.
Equipment.
Pizzorno has played a red Rickenbacker 481 guitar in nearly all of Kasabian's music videos (excluding the video for "Switchblade Smiles") and nearly all their live performances. He also uses another rare guitar, a red 1966 Fender Coronado II with a golden pickguard, notable for unique guitar sound from their 2009 single "Underdog" despite the Rickenbacker 481 being shown in the music video. The Fender Coronado is used for their live performances of the song. The Fender Coronado is also used during live performances of their 2009 song "Where Did All the Love Go?"
Pizzorno's guitars include:

Cytoplasmic male sterility

Cytoplasmic male sterility is total or partial male sterility in hermaphrodite organisms, as the result of specific nuclear and mitochondrial interactions. Male sterility is the failure to produce functional anthers, pollen, or male gametes. Such male sterility in hermaphrodite populations leads to gynodioecious populations (populations with coexisting fully functioning hermaphrodites and male-sterile hermaphrodites).
Cytoplasmic male sterility, as the name indicates, is under extranuclear genetic control (under control of the mitochondrial or plastid genomes). It shows non-Mendelian inheritance, with male sterility inherited maternally. In general, there are two types of cytoplasm: N (normal) and aberrant S (sterile) cytoplasms. These types exhibit reciprocal differences.
History.
Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter was the first to document male sterility in plants. In the 18th century, he reported on anther abortion within species and specific hybrids.
Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is mostly found in angiosperms and has been identified in more than 140 angiosperm species.
CMS has also been identified in one animal species so far, "Physa acuta", a fresh water snail.
There is strong evidence for gynodioecy and CMS to be a transitionary step between hermaphrodites and separated sexes.
Male sterility is more prevalent than female sterility. This could be because the male sporophyte and gametophyte are less protected from the environment than the ovule and embryo sac. Male-sterile plants can set seed and propagate. Female-sterile plants cannot develop seeds and will not propagate.
Manifestation of male sterility in CMS may be controlled either entirely by cytoplasmic factors or by interactions between cytoplasmic factors and nuclear factors. Male sterility can arise spontaneously via mutations in nuclear genes and/or cytoplasmic or cytoplasmic–genetic. In this case, the trigger for CMS is in the extranuclear genome - (mitochondria or chloroplast). The extranuclear genome is only maternally inherited. Natural selection on cytoplasmic genes could also lead to low pollen production or male sterility.
Male sterility is easy to detect because a large number of pollen grains are produced in male fertile plants. Pollen grains can be assayed through staining techniques (carmine, lactophenol or iodine).
Resource relocation.
CMS is one case of male-sterility, but this condition can also originate from nuclear genes. In the case of nuclear male sterility (when male sterility is caused by a nuclear mutation), the transmission of the male sterility allele is cut in half, since the entire male reproductive pathway is canceled.
CMS differs from the latter case (nuclear male sterility) because most cytoplasmic genetic elements are only transmitted maternally. This entails that for a cytoplasmic genetic element, causing male sterility doesn't affect its transmission rate since it is not transmitted via the male reproductive pathway.
Inactivation of the male reproductive pathway (sperm production, production of male reproductive organs, etc) can lead to resource relocation to the female reproductive pathway, increasing the female reproductive capabilities (female fitness), this phenomenon is referred to as Female Advantage (FA). The female advantage of many gynodioecious species has been quantified (as the ratio between male-sterile's female fitness and hermaphrodites' female fitness) and is mostly comprised between 1 and 2.
In the case of nuclear male-sterility, a female advantage of at least 2 is required to make it evolutionary neutral (FA=2) or advantageous (FA &gt; 2) since half of the transmission is cut because of the male-sterility allele.
Cytoplasmic male-sterility requires no female advantage to be evolutionary neutral (FA=1), or a small female advantage to be evolutionary advantageous (FA &gt; 1).
As far as we know, CMS is much more common than nuclear male-sterility with results from a study of 49 gynodioecious plants found 17 species (35%) exhibiting CMS and only 7 (14%) exhibiting nuclear male-sterility (all remaining species have unknown determinism of male-sterility).
Genetic sterility.
While CMS is controlled by an extranuclear genome, nuclear genes may have the capability to restore fertility. When nuclear restoration of fertility genes is available for a CMS system in any crop, it is cytoplasmic–genetic male sterility; the sterility is manifested by the influence of both nuclear (with Mendelian inheritance) and cytoplasmic (maternally inherited) genes. There are also restorers of fertility ("Rf") genes that are distinct from genetic male sterility genes. The "Rf" genes have no expression of their own unless the sterile cytoplasm is present. "Rf" genes are required to restore fertility in S cytoplasm that causes sterility. Thus plants with N cytoplasm are fertile and S cytoplasm with genotype "Rf"- leads to fertiles while S cytoplasm with "rfrf" produces only male steriles. Another feature of these systems is that "Rf" mutations ("i.e.", mutations to "rf" or no fertility restoration) are frequent, so that N cytoplasm with "Rfrf" is best for stable fertility.
Cytoplasmic–genetic male sterility systems are widely exploited in crop plants for hybrid breeding, and for maintaining hybrid lines, due to the convenience of controlling sterility expression by manipulating the gene–cytoplasm combinations in any selected genotype. Incorporation of these systems for male sterility evades the need for emasculation in cross-pollinated species, thus encouraging cross breeding producing only hybrid seeds under natural conditions. 
Examples of such (patented) systems, which require genetic manipulation, are: a Barnase gene construct, Pioneer's Seed Production Technology (SPT), Monsanto's Roundup Hybridization System (RHS) I and II. The GMO insertion may or may not be inherited by the filial production line.
In hybrid breeding.
Hybrid production requires a plant from which no viable male gametes are introduced. This selective exclusion of viable male gametes can be accomplished via different paths. One path, emasculation is done to prevent a plant from producing pollen so that it can serve only as a female parent. Another simple way to establish a female line for hybrid seed production is to identify or create a line that is unable to produce viable pollen. Since a male-sterile line cannot self-pollinate, seed formation is dependent upon pollen from another male line. Cytoplasmic male sterility is also used in hybrid seed production. In this case, male sterility is maternally transmitted and all progeny will be male sterile. These CMS lines must be maintained by repeated crossing to a sister line (known as the maintainer line) that is genetically identical except that it possesses normal cytoplasm and is therefore male-fertile. In cytoplasmic–genetic male sterility restoration of fertility is done using restorer lines carrying nuclear genes. The male-sterile line is maintained by crossing with a maintainer line carrying the same nuclear genome but with normal fertile cytoplasm.
For crops such as onions or carrots where the commodity harvested from the F1 generation is vegetative growth, male sterility is not a problem.
Maize breeding.
Cytoplasmic male sterility is an important part of hybrid maize production. The first commercial cytoplasmic male sterile, discovered in Texas, is known as CMS-T. The use of CMS-T, starting in the 1950s, eliminated the need for detasseling. In the early 1970s, plants containing CMS-T genetics were susceptible to southern corn leaf blight and suffered from widespread loss of yield. Since then, CMS types C and S were used instead. Unfortunately, these lines are prone to environmentally induced fertility restoration and must be carefully monitored in the field. Environmentally induced, in contrast to genetic, restoration occurs when certain environmental stimuli signal the plant to bypass sterility restrictions and produce pollen anyway.
Genome sequencing of mitochondrial genomes of crop plants has facilitated the identification of promising candidates for CMS-related mitochondrial rearrangements. The systematic sequencing of new plant species in recent years has also uncovered the existence of several novel nuclear restoration of fertility (RF) genes and their encoded proteins. A unified nomenclature for the RF defines protein families across all plant species and facilitates comparative functional genomics. This nomenclature accommodates functional RF genes and pseudogenes, and offers the flexibility needed to incorporate additional RFs as they become available in future.

Fire chief

A fire chief or fire commissioner is a top executive rank or commanding officer in a fire department.
Nomenclature.
Various official English-language titles for a fire chief include "fire chief", "chief fire officer" and "fire commissioner". The latter can refer to a fire chief or to an overseer who works for the local government. "Chief fire officer" is the usual title in the United Kingdom. Traditionally, a fire chief in Scotland was known as a "fire master", but this was changed in 2006.
The definition of the term "fire officer" varies by country, but generally refers to all firefighting personnel who have some command duties. This is comparable to the usage of "officer" in the military, rather than the term "police officer". In fire departments of the United States, fire officers who are part of an engine company or other unit (lieutenants and captains) are "company officers" and those ranked higher (e.g. battalion chiefs) are "chief officers".
Appointment.
A fire chief is usually appointed by the authority who oversees the running of the fire department, such as the mayor for a municipal fire department.
It varies among countries as to whether it is the norm or not for fire chiefs to be former frontline firefighters. This is the case in the United States. It is also the norm in the United Kingdom, though in recent years there have been exceptions. By contrast, in France, fire officers and frontline firefighters are recruited separately in a similar way to the military.
Duties and functions.
A fire chief's role varies considerably depending on the size of the department. Some countries have a single national fire service, such as Israel, New Zealand, and the Philippines. Conversely, some countries, like the United States and Germany, have autonomous fire departments even in small towns. Others organize their fire services based on subdivisions such as regions, counties, provinces or sub-national states.
The larger the fire department, the more ranks will exist in between the chief and regular firefighters, such as assistants or deputy chiefs. The chief of a small volunteer fire department is likely to be the main incident commander for the majority of their call-outs and is nearly always a volunteer as well. However, the chief of a large fire department is employed in a mostly administrative role, and will only be called out to the largest incidents.
Administrative.
The fire chief is responsible for carrying out the day-to-day tasks of running a firefighting organization. Such tasks include supervising other officers and firefighters at an emergency scene and recruiting, training, and equipping them for their respective duties. Depending upon local needs and organization, the chief may also be involved in fire prevention, fire inspection, disaster preparedness, emergency medical services, and related disciplines, as well as administrative duties such as budgets and personnel issues, research into safety and regulations, and liaison with other agencies. The chief is answerable to the local or national government that oversees the fire service. As well as the position of chief of scheduling.
Incident command.
During an emergency incident, the first fire officer on the scene must "establish command", which can then be transferred to more senior officers such as the chief. The chief may delegate some statutory powers to qualified officers, such as the ability to enter or use private property as reasonably necessary to stop a fire, or to order people or property seized as may be essential to preserving safety or investigating the cause of an incident.
A fire chief's vehicle is not only a means of transport, but can act as an incident command post and a contact point for media reporters.

Armin Luistro

Armin Altamirano Luistro (born December 24, 1961) is a Filipino Lasallian Brother who served as secretary of the Department of Education of the Philippines under President Benigno Aquino III. He is the first Asian Superior General of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools or De La Salle Brothers worldwide. Luistro entered De La Salle Scholasticate (the center for academic training of De La Salle Brothers to become full-fledged educators) in Manila in April 1979 while he was studying in De La Salle University (DLSU). He received the religious habit of the congregation in October 1981 at the La Salle Novitiate in Lipa. He professed his first religious vows in October 1982, and his final vows in May 1988.
He started teaching as a religion teacher at De La Salle Lipa in 1983. He was made provincial of the De La Salle Brothers Philippine District in April 1997, a post he held until 2003. On August 26, 2000, Luistro co-founded the De La Salle Catholic University Manado, in Indonesia with Josef Suwatan, Roman Catholic Bishop of Manado.
In April 2004, he succeeded Andrew Gonzalez as the president of De La Salle University System, consequently making him the president of eight De La Salle institutions. He worked into establishing De La Salle Philippines (DLSP) which replaced the system. The DLSP National Mission Council appointed him DLSP President and Chief Executive Officer on November 29, 2005.
He was appointed as the Secretary of Education of the Philippines on June 30, 2010, becoming the second De La Salle brother to hold the post—the other was Gonzalez who was in office from 1998 to 2001. Luistro has the least net worth among Aquino's cabinet. He had ₱89,000 (US$2,060). In contrast, the richest—Cesar Purisima who is Secretary of Finance—had ₱252 million (US$5.84 million).
The Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) have expressed skepticism over Luistro's stand on sex education citing his religious background. Nevertheless, the Department of Education has included sex education in its curriculum for grade 5 to fourth year high school. Roman Catholic groups have criticized it for allegedly not covering the emotional, psychological and spiritual dimensions of sexuality.
Luistro is a major proponent of the K+12 Basic Education Program in the Philippines, and personally managed the implementation of R.A. 10533 or the K-12 Law as the Education Secretary. The program sought to add two years to the previous 10-year basic education curriculum. Numerous parties had opposed the plan including Ateneo de Manila University President Bienvenido Nebres and progressive groups of students, teachers and parents.
Educational background.
Luistro was born on December 24, 1961, to José Dimayuga Luistro and Magdalena Aranda Altamirano-Luistro in Lipa, Batangas, Philippines. He attended first grade at Our Lady of the Rosary Academy in Lipa, grades 2 to 5 at Canossa Academy Lipa, and graduated elementary and high school at De La Salle Lipa. He pursued his undergraduate studies at De La Salle University in Manila under a scholarship, and was conferred Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Letters in March 1981. When asked in a "Manila Bulletin" interview in 2009, he shared that he had spent most of his education in Batangas, and since DLSU had no uniforms, he "wore all the "badúy" [unfashionable] type of shirts", as he put it, using the Tagalog word for "unfashionable", while most of his classmates were from elite high schools. Thus he says "I supposed [they] laughed at me."
In 1981 he entered into a program in Ateneo de Manila University, and was awarded a Certificate in Formation Institute for Religious Educators in 1985. He enrolled in a graduate program in DLSU in 1991, and was conferred a Master of Arts degree in Religious Education in 1993. He also graduated with a master's degree in religious education and values formation at the same university in 2003. He was conferred a doctorate degree in educational management with the highest Academic Excellence Award and Most Outstanding Dissertation in May 2005 at the University of St. La Salle in Bacolod.
He was made Doctor of Humane Letters, "honoris causa", by La Salle University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States on May 9, 2004.
Religious and academic career.
Luistro entered the De La Salle Scholasticate (the center for academic training of De La Salle Brothers) in Manila in April 1979, and received the religious habit in October 1981 at the La Salle Novitiate in Lipa. He professed his first religious vows in October 1982, and his final vows in May 1988. In the "Manila Bulletin" interview, he said that teaching was the reason why he entered the congregation.
He started teaching as a religion teacher at De La Salle Lipa in 1983. He moved to La Salle Greenhills in 1986. He was made provincial of the De La Salle Brothers Philippine District in April 1997, a post he held until 2003.
On August 26, 2000, Luistro co-founded the De La Salle Catholic University of Manado, currently known as De La Salle University, in Indonesia with Josef Suwatan, Roman Catholic Bishop of Manado. DLSU in Manila supervised initial operations before it was transferred to the Philippine District.
On April 2004, he succeeded Andrew Gonzalez as the president of De La Salle University System, consequently making him the president of eight De La Salle institutions. In his inaugural speech, he acknowledged the "multiversity" concept of Gonzalez who established the system. In which structure, DLSU served as the flagship while other De La Salle institutions specialized in fields like agriculture, alternative education and medicine.
He did, however, find the system's structure unfeasible. He worked into establishing De La Salle Philippines which replaced the system. Under the reorganization, other De La Salle institutions were included in the network—a total of 17. Each De La Salle institution was autonomous and had its own president. The DLSP National Mission Council appointed him DLSP President and Chief Executive Officer on November 29, 2005.
Luistro and 18 other people were appointed as members of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life of the Roman Curia by Pope Leo XIV on June 24, 2025.
Political involvement.
Luistro called for the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo during the height of the Hello Garci scandal in 2005. In which time, he became close to the Aquino family, a prominent political family in the Philippines. He also delivered a eulogy (named "Cory, the Heart of a Saint") during the wake of former President Corazon Aquino, and said "our closeness with her was really borne out of that period [Hello Garci scandal], none of her children went to La Salle."
Work at the Department of Education.
President Benigno Aquino III, Corazon's son, appointed him as the secretary of the Department of Education. He was inaugurated on June 30, 2010, becoming the second De La Salle brother to hold the post—the other was Gonzalez who was in office from 1998 to 2001.
Aquino gave Luistro two years to address problems, including insufficient books, classrooms and teachers. Luistro estimated that there were a lack of 130,000 teachers; 72,000 classrooms; 7 million desks; 141,000 comfort rooms; and 96 million books. In his 2013 State of the Nation Address or SONA, Aquino praised Bro. Luistro for successfully erasing the shortages of resources and classrooms inherited from the previous administrations.
As of December 2010, Luistro has the least net worth among Aquino's cabinet. He had ₱89,000 (US$2,060). In contrast, the richest—Cesar Purisima who is Secretary of Finance—had ₱252 million (US$5.84 million). He declared an annual gross salary of ₱989,496 (US$22,900).
Sex education.
The Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) have expressed skepticism over Luistro's stand on sex education citing his religious background. Meanwhile, Luistro's predecessor, Mona Valisno expressed her confidence with Luistro.
The Department of Education has included sex education in its curriculum for fifth grade to fourth year high school, which is still included in the K-12 program. Roman Catholic groups have criticized it for allegedly not covering the emotional, psychological and spiritual dimensions of sexuality. Likewise, former Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lingayen-Dagupan Oscar V. Cruz criticized Luistro for his alleged lack of comment regarding the Reproductive Health Bill, which proposes to integrate sex education in public schools. He appealed Luistro to "stop teaching lewd studies [sex education] in schools" (trans.).
Luistro stated that sex education was not his priority. He instead wanted to focus on streamlining the bureaucracy of DepEd, which employs 600,000 employees (501,158 of which are teachers). In line with this, he announced on December 28, 2010, that DepEd would terminate all of its 67 consultants by the end of the year. The DepEd-National Employees Union, in response, has called for his resignation. Luistro argued, however, that "streamlining is a must" as bulk of the department's budget goes to funding the salary of its employees.
K+12 Basic Education Program.
Luistro is a major proponent of the K+12 Basic Education Program in the Philippines. The program seeks to add two years to the current 10-year basic education curriculum, and make graduates more competitive. The program involves kindergarten, six years of elementary, four years of junior high school, and two years of senior high school. Kindergarten was required in 2012 while senior high school is planned to be included in the curriculum by 2016. DepEd said that 77 percent of its participants in fora are in favor of the change. Before its implementation in 2012, the Philippines was the only country in Asia which employed 10 years of basic education—all other countries had 12. Numerous parties have opposed the plan including Ateneo de Manila University President Bienvenido Nebres and progressive groups of students, teachers and parents. A spokesperson of No To K–12 Alliance said:
Indigenous framework of education.
Luistro signed on behalf of the Deped the national policy framework for Indigenous peoples education in 2011. The framework aims to address Indigenous peoples' lack of access to "culture-responsive basic education". The framework directs DepEd offices and units to ensure that textbooks and other learning materials are free from discriminatory and erroneous content that misrepresent the history and culture of Indigenous peoples.
Non-academic work.
Luistro is also the president of the largest business NGO in the country, the Philippine Business for Social Progress (PBSP). He has held various positions in other governmental and intergovernmental organisations, such as the Advisory Council of the National Youth Commission (NYC), the UNESCO National Commission of the Philippines and the South East Asian Ministers of Education Organisation (SEAMEO).
On June 24 of 2025, Pope Leo XIV also named him as a member of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life making him the first Filipino and Asian descent to hold the position. As stated on the Vatican's website, the dicastery is a section of the Roman Curia tasked with promoting, supporting, and overseeing the implementation of evangelical counsels.
Honors.
Bro. Luistro has been honored with the eponymous Bro. Armin Luistro Park at the Kalipay Elementary School in Gingoog City. For his work in human rights, Bro. Luistro has also been awarded as one of the first "Most Distinguished Human Rights Defenders" by Amnesty International in 2020. He was awarded the 2023 Gawad Bukas Palad Award by the Ateneo De Manila University for exhibiting the Ignatian spirit of generosity in giving back to the poor and the suffering.
In 2016, Bro. Luistro was awarded the Order of Lakandula by Pres. Benigno Aquino for his legacy as Education Secretary.

Nandi County

Nandi County is a county in Kenya in the North Rift, occupying an area of 2,884.4 square kilometres. Its capital, Kapsabet, is the largest town in the county while other towns include Mosoriot, Tinderet, Kobujoi, Kaiboi, Kabiyet and Nandi Hills. According to a 2019 census, the county has a population of 885,711, made up of a number of Kenyan communities, the majority of whom belong to the native tribe called Nandi.
Geographically, the unique jug-shaped structure of Nandi County is bound by the Equator to the south and extends northwards to latitude 0034’N. The western boundary extends to west. The county's major area is covered by the Nandi Hills.
History.
Historically, Nandi like other Kalenjin areas was divided into districts known as emotinwek (sing. "emet"). There were six "emotinwek" in Nandi which were Wareñg in the north, Mosop in the East, Soiin (also known as Pelkut) in the south-east, Aldai and Chesumei in the west and Em'gwen in the center.
The districts were further divided into divisions known as bororiōsiek (sing. "bororiet") which were made up of several villages known as "koret". 
Settlement.
The traditional Nandi account is that the first settlers in Nandi came from Elgon and formed the Kipoiis clan; a name that possibly means 'the spirits'. They were led by a man named Kakipoch, founder of the Nandi section of the Kalenjin and are said to have settled in the emet of Aldai in south-western Nandi. One of the early Nandi bororiōsiek was named after Kakipoch.
Studies of the settlement pattern indicate that the southern regions were the first to be settled. As of 1910, these comprised the emet of Aldai on the west and the, by then annexed, emet of Soiin on the east. It was conjectured that the first pororiosiek were Kakipoch in Aldai and Tuken in Soiin.
It is notable that Sirikwa holes (known to the Nandi as mukowanisiek) were almost non-existent in the areas first settled, being only present on the Nandi Escarpment itself. They were however found in great numbers in the northern regions of Nandi.
Inward migrants and general population growth are thought to have led to a northward expansion of the growing identity during the eighteenth century. This period is thought to have seen the occupation and establishment of the emotinwek of Chesume, Emgwen and Masop. This period would also have seen the establishment of more pororosiek.
The final expansion occurred during the middle of the nineteenth century when the Nandi took the Uain Gishu plateau from the Uasin Gishu. Traditions contained in the tale of Tapkendi however seem to indicate that the plateau was previously held by the Nandi and that Nandi place names were superseded by Maasai names. This is further evinced by certain "Masai place-names in eastern Nandi which indicate that the Masai had temporary possession of strip of Nandi roughly five miles wide", these include Ndalat, Lolkeringeti, Nduele and Ol-lesos, which were by the early nineteenth century in use by the Nandi as koret names.
Late 19th century.
Nandi county was the scene of the resistance struggle that has come to be known as the Nandi Resistance. The traditional system of governance came to an end c.1905 with the end of the resistance struggle. This was followed by the subsequent absorption of Nandi into the East African Protectorate in 1905 and later into the Kenya Colony in 1920.
The Emet of Wareng was amalgamated into the Uasin Gishu district during the colonial period. It is today part of Uasin Gishu County and last bore its name as a county of Eldoret South Constituency. The Emet of Soiin would be appropriated for European occupation, as part of what were known as the white highlands, during the colonial period. It was later split in two and is today named after the Tinderet and Nandi Hills.

The county () is further sub-divided into 30 wards namely:
Constituencies.
The county consists of six constituencies: 151. Tinderet, 152. Aldai, 153. Nandi Hills, 154. Chesumei, 155. Emgwen, 156. Mosop.
Education and sports.
Nandi County is home to many world record holders in athletics, including Kipchoge Keino, Henry Rono, Eliud Kipchoge, Pamela Jelimo, Janeth Jepkosgei, Moses Tanui, Julius Yego, Jairus Birech, Conseslus Kipruto and Bernard Lagat.

Black Antlers

Black Antlers is a studio album by the experimental band Coil. It was originally released in CD-R format in 2004 in a limited edition and was sold during their Even an Evil Fatigue mini-tour. The album was later re-edited by Peter Christopherson and expanded to include a second CD of two new tracks, as well as a new track on the first disc. The second edition was released in August 2006 on the same day as the expanded version of "The Remote Viewer". Both reissues were mastered by Mark Godwin, printed in Thailand and feature high quality images and packaging. Although the original edition did not include a catalogue number, the reissue was given a catalogue number of THBKK2. In 2025, it was revealed on Coil’s Spotify page that it will be released on streaming services June 27, 2025.
All songs from the original pressing of the album were played live around the time of this release. One such performance – Coil's June 2004 appearance in Jesi, Italy – was recorded and issued as "Selvaggina, Go Back into the Woods", allowing comparison between the studio versions and their slightly altered live arrangements.
Song info.
"The Gimp (Sometimes)" was originally released as a recording by Coil on the compilation "Hate People Like Us" featuring remixes and covers of the band People Like Us. The original version was titled "The Gimp/Sometimes" and sounds much less developed than the version on "Black Antlers". The lyrics to this song also appeared in an untitled live piece performed at New Forms III in 2002.
"Sex with Sun Ra" had been mentioned by Coil for many years before finally appearing on "Black Antlers", even as far back as six years prior. A version of "Sex with Sun Ra (Part One – Saturnalia)", titled simply "Sex with Sun Ra", later appeared on the compilation "Rough Trade Shops: Counter Culture 04". The version on the compilation is 6:00 in length. The track was written about eccentric jazz musician Sun Ra.
"Wraiths and Strays (From Montreal)" is from a live performance on 29 May 2003, in Montreal, Canada at Mutek 2003. "The Wraiths and Strays of Paris" is an edited version of a live performance in Paris, France at on 23 May 2004. The key difference between the two versions is that the Mutek performance features only Christopherson and Thighpaulsandra while the Paris recording features the full touring line-up. The song is built around a sample of the track "Montparnasse" by King of Woolworths which was initially used without permission.
"All the Pretty Little Horses" is a traditional lullaby that was brought to light on the Current 93 album "All the Pretty Little Horses". Balance provided vocals for three tracks on this album and often introduced the song live as being "from my friend's album".
"Teenage Lightning (10th Birthday Version)" is a version of the songs "Teenage Lightning 1" and "Teenage Lightning 2" from the previous Coil album "Love's Secret Domain". The version of the song as it appears on "Black Antlers" is similar to the version on "The Ape of Naples" titled "Teenage Lightning 2005".
"Black Antlers (Where's Your Child?)" is a cover of the 1988 acid house track "Where's Your Child?" by Bam Bam. Coil's studio recording is instrumental but, when performing the song live, Balance sang the vocal parts from the Bam Bam version.

Freakbeat

Freakbeat is a loosely defined subgenre of rock and roll music developed mainly by harder-driving British groups during the Swinging London period of the mid-to late 1960s. The genre bridges British Invasion R&amp;B, beat and psychedelia.
Etymology.
The term was coined by English music journalist Phil Smee when he was compiling the Rubble series of compilations in the 1980s, to retrospectively define a style of 1960s British rock music. AllMusic writes that "freakbeat" is loosely defined, but generally describes the more obscure but hard-edged artists of the British Invasion era.
Compilations.
Much of the material collected on Rhino Records's 2001 box-set compilation "" can be classified as freakbeat.
The "English Freakbeat" series is a group of five compilation albums, released in the late 1980s, that were issued by AIP Records. The LPs featured recordings that were released in the mid-1960s by English rock bands in R&amp;B and beat genres. The series served as a follow-up to the "Pebbles, Volume 6" LP, itself subtitled "The Roots of Mod", which was the only album in the "Pebbles" series that was devoted to English music. When the "English Freakbeat" series was reissued as CDs in the 1990s, the "Pebbles, Volume 6" LP was adapted into the "English Freakbeat, Volume 6" CD.

King road drag

The King road drag (also known as the Missouri road drag and the split log road drag) was a simple form of a road grader implemented for grading dirt road. It revolutionized the maintenance of dirt roads in the early 1900s. It was invented by David Ward King, who went by "D. Ward King" and who was a farmer in Holt Township, near Maitland, Missouri.
It started out as two parallel logs with the cut side facing the front separated three feet by rigid separators and pulled by a team of two horses. Variations of the two-plank drag design but pulled by trucks or tractors are still used today to smooth the dirt infields of baseball diamonds.
In this simple design, the first log would remove clods and the second log would smooth the road. The logs were staggered so that dirt would be pushed to the center to create a crown so that water would rush off.
The very simple design replaced the old practice of dragging a road with a single log which left the surface unrepaired and rut-filled. It also made it possible for farmers to improve roads near their homes without having to wait for government graders.
D. Ward King of Maitland, Missouri requested a patent for the process in 1907 and received Patent 884,497 in 1908. He widely publicized the process in a U.S. Department of Agriculture "Farmers' Bulletin" #321 in 1908 under the title "The use of the split-log drag on earth roads" An important component of the grading process was that it had to occur when the road was wet.
This invention was the horse-drawn forerunner of the modern-day road grader. It was a sensation in its day. States passed laws requiring its use. The design was so simple that King did not enforce his patent rights. However, he did tour the country explaining to how to use it. He also wrote articles such as one that appeared in the May 7, 1910 issue of the Saturday Evening Post entitled “Good Roads Without Money.”
King would further enhance his invention with his patent 1,102,671 in 1914 which included four bars and two triangular scrapers.
Before the King Road Drag, dirt roads turned into a quagmire when they were wet—especially in the winter.
The widespread use of the King Road Drag came along during the Good Roads Movement, driven by bicyclists and later by automobile drivers. Automobiles benefitted since Macadam roads were rapidly destabilized by cars, which sucked the cementing dust out of smooth macadam roads. Solid roads meant people could use their automobiles on the roads between cities. Solid rural roads also made possible reliable rural mail delivery, which did much to promote commerce in the United States between city-based businesses and the rural population. For instance, they allowed Sears, Roebuck to start sending out its catalogs to small towns and farms and thereby vastly increase the size of its customer base.

International Holocaust Cartoon Competition

International Holocaust Cartoon Contest was a 2006 cartoon competition, sponsored by the Iranian newspaper "Hamshahri", to denounce what it called Western "double standards on freedom of speech". The event was staged in response to the "Jyllands-Posten" Muhammad cartoons controversy. The United States State Department, the Israeli Foreign Ministry and United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, among others, strongly criticized the contest.
In January 2015, in the wake of the "Charlie Hebdo" shooting and the magazine's subsequent decision to publish further cartoons of Muhammad, the Iranian House of Cartoon and the Sarcheshmeh Cultural Complex in Iran announced that they would be sponsoring The 2nd International Holocaust Cartoons Contest. Selected cartoons were exhibited in Tehran beginning on 14 May 2016.
2006 competition.
On 6 February 2006, Farid Mortazavi, graphics editor of "Hamshahri", announced a competition for cartoons on the Holocaust. 12 best contributions were to be rewarded with a gold coin each, which were later increased to $5,000 to $12,000 prizes for the top three cartoons and three gold coins each for 12 other cartoonists. Later, "Hamshahri" published an English introduction to the contest, as well as preliminary rules.
The contest was created in response to the 12 cartoons published by the Danish newspaper "Jyllands-Posten" to challenge the championing of freedom of speech in the defense of the "Jyllands-Posten" cartoons. This was done under the notion that those who supported the "Jyllands-Posten"s right to free anti-Islamic speech would be placed in a precarious position were they to condemn the antisemitic cartoons targeted at one of the most sensitive of Jewish topics. In that introductory message for the contest, "Hamshahri" denounced what it called Western hypocrisy on freedom of speech, alleging that "it is impossible in the West to joke upon or even discuss certain topics related to Judaism, such as the Holocaust, and the pretexts for the creation of Israel".
On 14 February 2006, the editor in chief of "Hamshahri" commented in Persian that "the purpose of establishing such a competition is not to offend or ridicule anyone, but to do a discussion about the realities of the Holocaust". He also indicated that "Hamshahri" tries really hard not to cause pain for anyone and also added that the newspaper has no contention with the Jews in Iran or any other place, but that it has problems with Zionism. Masood Shojaei, the director of Iran's Caricature House, which co-sponsored the competition, said, "Iran's Caricature House, as the only technically qualified center involved in the competition regards the Holocaust topic as a terrible and saddening issue." The exhibition put on by The Iran Cartoon Organisation and "Hamshahri" newspaper opened on 14 August 2006.
After the winners were announced in November 2006, Shojaei said that the competition would become an annual event. The Associated Press quoted him as saying, "Actually, we will continue until the destruction of Israel." However, Shojaei categorically denies that he even spoke to the Associated Press reporter.
Reactions.
In Iran.
Conservative newspapers such as "Kayhan" and "Jomhouri Eslami" hailed the decision by "Hamshahri" for the contest, and their cartoonists, such as Maziyar Bizhani, actively entered the competition.
Several reformers criticized the cartoon competition and also the president's statements about the Holocaust. Emadeddin Baghi, a member of the religious-intellectuals circle, Ebrahim Yazdi, the head of Nehzat Azadi Party, Hamid Reza Jalaeipour, a prominent figure of Islamic Iran Participation Front and Sadeq Zibakalam, a prominent political analyst of the Kargozaran party criticized these new policies by calling them "useless, scientifically-baseless and purely political actions which originates from the authorities' lack of historical knowledge". In an interview with "BBC News", Nikahang Kowsar, a former cartoonist for "Hamshahri", said he thought the competition was the wrong approach. "It's a bad reaction to a bad action coming from the Danish newspaper," he told the BBC. He also claimed in his weblog that "Hamshahri" cartoonists would have a bad fate if they refused to take part in the competition.
In Israel.
Israeli artists spoofed the contest with the Israeli antisemitic cartoons contest.
International.
On 8 February 2006, Flemming Rose (the cultural editor for "Jyllands-Posten"), told CNN, "My newspaper is trying to establish a contact with that Iranian newspaper "Hamshahri", and we would run the cartoons the same day as they publish them." Later that day, the paper's editor-in-chief said that "Jyllands-posten" would under no circumstances publish the Holocaust cartoons.
Six of the least controversial cartoons of the International Holocaust Cartoon Competition were republished by the Danish newspaper "Dagbladet Information" on 8 September 2006, after the editor consulted the main rabbi in Copenhagen, and three cartoons were later reprinted in "Jyllands-Posten" as well.
The event was also criticised by the then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the U.S. State Department, the Israeli foreign ministry, Reporters Without Borders, the Anti-Defamation League and other parties.
Winners.
On 1 November 2006, the political cartoonist Abdellah Derkaoui (), a Moroccan, was announced as the winner and received the first prize of US$12,000. Derkaoui's winning cartoon differed from many of the runners-up, in that it did not deny the Holocaust; instead, it used the Holocaust to make a comparison between the actions of Nazi Germany and the contemporary actions of the Israeli government.
The second prize of US$8,000 was split between the Brazilian cartoonist Carlos Latuff and the far-right French cartoonist Chard, although Chard refused the prize, stating that her cartoon was entered into the competition without her consent. According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, the cartoon by Chard contains explicit Holocaust denial.
Shahram Rezai of Iran won the third prize of US$5,000. In addition to the main prizes, there were also "Special Prizes" of three gold coins awarded to several entries. One of these prizes went to Italy, one prize to Morocco, two to Jordan, one to Syria, two to Brazil and five to Iranians.
2016 competition.
In December 2015, two state-sponsored Iranian cultural organizations, the Owj Media &amp; Art Institute and the Sarcheshmeh Cultural Complex, announced a Holocaust cartoon contest. Over 150 cartoons from the contest made up a May 2016 exhibition in the art section at the Islamic Propaganda Organization in Tehran, as part of Iran's Cartoon Biennial. After the closing of the Tehran exhibition at the end of May 2016, the Islamic Propaganda Organization sponsored exhibitions of selected cartoons in provincial capitals throughout the country.
Reactions.
In Iran.
In an April 2016 interview published in the "New Yorker", Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tried to distance the Iranian government from the contest, asserting that it did not receive government support or endorsement, and that no official permission was necessary to hold it. Following Zarif's statement, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance questioned the Foreign Minister's comments, stating that the Ministry supports any program that will "enlighten people about the Holocaust". The main spokesperson for the contest, Mas'oud Shoja'i Tabataba'i, said that Zarif was not welcome at the exhibition. Zarif was questioned in the Iranian parliament about his negative position on the Holocaust cartoon contest and exhibition three months after its closing. He maintained his belief that Holocaust denial does not benefit the Islamic Republic of Iran and he repeated the claim that the contest was the work of an NGO and not any government agency.
International.
American political cartoonist Daryl Cagle entered a cartoon into the Second Holocaust Cartoon Competition in 2015. The cartoon features Iran's Supreme Leader with his face in the shape of a pair of human buttocks: the face / posterior is farting out the words to his famous statement, "The Holocaust is an event whose reality is uncertain and if it has happened, it's uncertain how it happened."
"I'm guessing the Iranians will not choose to include my cartoon in their exhibition and competition – but considering how the contest organizers complain about the "West" censoring "discussion" of the Holocaust, I thought it was a nice irony to give them a Holocaust cartoon that they would likely censor," wrote Cagle.
Irina Bokova, the director-general of UNESCO, condemned the holding of it: "Such an initiative which aims at a mockery of the genocide of the Jewish people, a tragic page of humanity's history, can only foster hatred and incite to violence, racism and anger. This contest goes against the universal values of tolerance and respect, and runs counter to the action led by UNESCO to promote Holocaust education, to fight anti-Semitism and denial."
Winners.
On 31 May 2016, the French cartoonist Zeon was announced as the winner and received the first prize of US$12,000. He had been arrested by French authorities in March 2015 for anti-Semitic work that he drew in 2011. His winning work features what appears to be the entry gate of a Nazi-era death camp on top of a cash register with six million in cash inside.
The Indonesian artist Jitet Koestana won the second prize of US$7,000 while Mahmud Nazari from Iran won the third prize of US$5,000. As in the 2006 contest, Special prizes of three gold coins were awarded to several entries. One each of these went to Belgium, Morocco, Turkey and several other countries.
The Belgian winner, Luc Descheemaeker, using the name O-sekoer, is a schoolteacher in a Catholic school in the Flemish city of Torhout. The school and the city felt very honored that he won a prize at that contest. The Flemish press defended him against Jewish organisations condemning the contest. The mayor of Torhout was the Flemish minister of education, Hilde Crevits, who refused to condemn the cartoon. Descheemaeker was consequently nominated cultural ambassador of Torhout. Meanwhile, other antisemitic cartoons drawn by him were discovered.
After the contest, the Iranian House of Cartoon and the Sarcheshmeh Cultural Complex announced another similar contest, this time calling for cartoon submissions on the "Zionist Caliphate" that would focus on "Zionism, terrorism and racism" and "ISIL terrorism and genocide in the name of religion and to the benefit of the Zionists". The deadline for entries was set for 16 June 2016, with the winners to be announced at a later date with cash prizes of up to US$5,000.

Programmable thermostat

A programmable thermostat is a thermostat which is designed to adjust the temperature according to a series of programmed settings that take effect at different times of the day. Programmable thermostats are also known as setback thermostats or clock thermostats.
Benefits.
Heating and cooling losses from a building (or any other container) become greater as the difference in temperature increases. A programmable thermostat allows reduction of these losses by allowing the temperature difference to be reduced at times when the reduced amount of heating or cooling would not be objectionable.
For example, during cooling season, a programmable thermostat used in a home may be set to allow the temperature in the house to rise during the workday when no one will be at home. It may then be set to turn on the air conditioning before the arrival of occupants, allowing the house to be cool upon the arrival of the occupants while still having saved air conditioning energy during the peak outdoor temperatures. The reduced cooling required during the day also decreases the demands placed upon the electrical supply grid.
Conversely, during the heating season, the programmable thermostat may be set to allow the temperature in the house to drop when the house is unoccupied during the day and also at night after all occupants have gone to bed, re-heating the house prior to the occupants arriving home in the evening or waking up in the morning. Since (as a matter of sleep hygiene) people sleep better when the bedroom is cool, and furthermore the temperature differential between the interior and exterior of a building is the greatest on a cold winter night, this reduces energy loss.
Similar scenarios are available in commercial buildings, with due consideration of the building's occupancy patterns.
According to "Consumer Reports" magazine, programmable thermostats can reduce energy bills by about $180 a year.
Controversy.
While programmable thermostats may be able to save energy when used correctly, little or no average energy savings has been demonstrated in residential field studies. Difficulty with usability in residential environments appears to lead to lack of persistence of energy savings in homes. According to the US EPA regarding residential programmable thermostat, "Available studies indicate no savings from programmable thermostat (PT) installation. Some studies indicate slight increased consumption." This is supported with studies by Nevius and Pigg, Cross and Judd and others and Peffer et al. has a recent review of the topic.
In addition to potential increased energy consumption, digital programmable thermostats have been criticised for their poor usability. Several studies have found that digital programmable thermostats are difficult for users to programme and older people in particular can struggle to use them (see Combe et al.). 
It has been noted that the use of programmable thermostats is hampered by misconception about the setback feature, reducing the amount of heating or cooling in a building needs for a short time (e.g. at night or when it is unoccupied). The belief is that if the building is allowed to change temperature, its heating or cooling system has to "work harder" to bring it back to a comfortable temperature, counteracting or even exceeding the energy saved during reduced heating or cooling. If set up correctly the setback and recovery feature can result in energy savings of five to fifteen percent as the heat transfer between a structure and its environment is proportional to the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the structure.
Construction and features.
Clock thermostats.
The most basic clock thermostats may only implement one program with two periods (a hotter period and a colder period), and the same program is run day after day. More sophisticated clock thermostats may allow four or more hot and cold periods to be set per day. Usually, only two distinct temperatures (a hotter temperature and a colder temperature) can be set, even if multiple periods are permitted. The hotter and colder temperatures are usually established simply by sliding two levers along an analogue temperature scale, much the same as in a conventional (non-clock) thermostat.
This design, while simple to manufacture and relatively easy to program, sacrifices comfort on weekends since the program is repeated each of the seven days of the week with no variation. To overcome this deficit, a push-button is sometimes provided to allow the user to explicitly switch (once) the current period from hot period to a cold period or vice versa; the usual use of this button is to over-ride a "set back" that takes place during the workday when the home is normally unoccupied.
The clock mechanism is electrical. Two methods have commonly been used to operate it:
[1] A separate, continuous source of 24 volts alternating current (24 VAC) is provided to the thermostat.
[2] A rechargeable battery in the thermostat operates the clock. This battery charges when the thermostat is not calling for heat and 24 VAC is available to it. It discharges to operate the clock when the thermostat is set for heating or cooling.
Digital thermostats.
Digital thermostats may implement the same functions, but most provide more versatility. For example, they commonly allow setting temperatures for two, four, or six periods each day, and rather than being limited to a single "hotter" temperature and a single "colder" temperature, digital thermostats usually allow each period to be set to a unique temperature. The periods are commonly labeled "Morning", "Day", "Evening", and "Night", although nothing constrains the time intervals involved. Digital thermostats usually allow the user to override the programmed temperature for the period, automatically resuming programmed temperatures when the next period begins. A function to "hold" (lock-in) the current temperature is usually provided as well; in this case, the override temperature is maintained until the user cancels the hold or a programmed event occurs to resume the normal program. More-sophisticated models will allow for the release of the hold to take place at a set time in the future.
As with clock thermostats, basic digital thermostats may have just one cycle that is run every day of the week. More-sophisticated thermostats may have a weekday schedule and a separate weekend schedule (so-called "5-2" setting) or separate Saturday and Sunday schedules (so-called "5-1-1" settings), while other thermostats will offer a separate schedule for each day of the week ("7 day" settings). The selection of which days are defined as the "weekend" is arbitrary, depending on the user's heating and cooling schedule requirements. Often, a manufacturer will sell three similar thermostats offering each of those levels of functionality, and there is no obvious difference in the thermostats other than the factory programming and the price.
Most digital thermostats have separate programs for heating and cooling, and may feature a digital or manual switch to turn on the furnace blower for air circulation, even when the system isn't heating or cooling. More-sophisticated models may be programmed to run the circulating fan for a brief 5- to 10-minute period in the event a heating or cooling cycle has not taken place during the previous hour. This is particularly useful in buildings subject to stratification where without frequent air circulation, hot air rises and separates from the cooler air that falls.
Digital thermostats may also have a user-programmable air filter change reminder; this counts the accumulated run-time of the heating/cooling system and reminds the user when it is time to change the filter. The feature often displays the accumulated run-time either as an aggregate of both heating and cooling or displaying each time separately.
Some digital thermostats have the capability of being programmed using a touch-tone telephone or over the Internet, such as the Nest Learning Thermostat.
Digital thermostats are usually powered one of three ways:
Digital thermostats with PID controller.
More expensive models have a built-in PID controller, so that the thermostat "learns" via a feedback loop how the overall system (including the room itself) will react to its commands. Programming the morning temperature to be 21° C at 7:00 a.m., for instance, ensures that the temperature would then be 21 °C, whereas less sophisticated programmable thermostat would simply start working toward 21° at 7:00 a.m. Thus a PID controller sets the time at which the system should be activated in order to reach the desired temperature at the desired time, having processed the data of the room temperature regimen by comparing the past temperature status of the room and its current temperature for an optimal start.
Process control or industrial thermostat also makes sure that the temperature is very stable(for instance, by reducing first overshoot and fluctuation at the end of the heating cycle) such that the comfort level is increased.
Commercial thermostats.
In commercial applications, the thermostat may not contain any clock mechanism. Instead, another means may be used to select between the "hotter" and "colder" settings. For example, if the thermostat uses pneumatic controls, a change in the air pressure supplied to the thermostat may select between the "hotter" and "colder" settings, and this air pressure is determined by a central regulator. With electronic controls, a specific signal may indicate whether to operate at the "hotter" or "colder" setting.

Airway beacon

An airway beacon (US) or aerial lighthouse (Europe) was a rotating light assembly mounted atop a tower. These were once used extensively in the United States for visual navigation by airplane pilots along a specified airway corridor. In Europe, they were used to guide aircraft with lighted beacons at night.
In Europe.
United Kingdom.
A network of aerial lighthouses was established in the United Kingdom and Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. Use of the lighthouses has declined with the advent of radio navigation aids such as NDB (non-directional beacon), VOR (VHF omnidirectional ranging) and DME (distance measuring equipment). The last operational aerial lighthouse in the United Kingdom is on top of the cupola over the RAF College main hall at RAF Cranwell.
Netherlands.
In the Netherlands, gas holders were painted with an arrow pointing north and two letters identifying their location.
In the United States.
Approximately 1,500 airway beacons were constructed to guide pilots from city to city, covering . Today, most of the beacons have been removed, but the State of Montana continues to maintain several as navigation aids in mountainous terrain. One beacon is preserved for historical purposes in Saint Paul, Minnesota at the Indian Mounds Park on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River. A rotating airway beacon has been in continuous operation at the summit of Rocky Butte in Portland, Oregon since 1929, though it was officially decommissioned during the 1960s. Recently, the beacon at Grants, New Mexico was restored for historic preservation, using original items found at other nearby sites.
A large concrete slab, in the shape of an arrow, was located near the base of each beacon. Many of these arrows remain today, some of which are visible from satellite pictures, even in urban settings.
Light characteristics.
An airway beacon has two distinct light characteristics: A revolving narrow white light beam about 5 degrees wide in azimuth and a set of fixed colored course lights of about 15 degrees width.
White rotating beacon.
The rotating beacon 24 inch (610 mm) parabolic mirror and a 110-volt, 1 kilowatt lamp. spinning at 6 rpm, creating a quick one-tenth second flash every ten seconds. In clear weather they could be seen for 40 miles (64 km). Montana took steps to modernize their beacons, encasing newer light systems in clear domes.
Red or green course lights.
Just below the white beacon, a set of red or green course lights point along each airway route. Red lights denote an airway beacon between landing fields while green denotes a beacon adjacent or upon a landing field. These course lights flash a Morse code letter identifying the beacon to the pilot. Each beacon is identified with a sequential number along the airway, and flash the red or green course lights with the Morse code ID of one of 10 letters: W, U, V, H, R, K, D, B, G or M. The letters represent the digits of 1 through 10 (W = 1, ..., M = 10). The course lights turn on for 0.5 second for a dot, 1.5 second for a dash with a 0.5 second between each dot or dash. A pause of 1.5 seconds separates each letter.
To help remember the letters and their sequence number, pilots memorized the following: "When Undertaking Very Hard Routes, Keep Direction By Good Methods." The beacons are depicted on navigation charts along with their number and Morse code pattern. For example, beacon number 15 would have a code digit of 5 (the unit's digit), hence the letter "R", and Morse code: "dit dah dit" (·−·).
History.
Airway beacons in the US were constructed by the Post Office and the Department of Commerce between 1923 and 1933. The Low Frequency Radio Range system began to replace this visual system in 1929. The last visual airway beacon was supposedly shut down in 1973, but a few airway beacons are still operating in Portland, Oregon and Western Montana. Those in Montana are charted on the Great Falls sectional chart. Montana was the last state to officially maintain airway beacons, through the state's Aviation Division. In 2017, the decision was made by Aeronautics Division to discontinue their maintenance of the system, due to the system's obsolete nature and budgetary concerns. The system was to be shut down entirely by December 31, 2021. In spring of 2018, fourteen of the seventeen beacons were shut down by MDT. The Montana Department of Transportation's Communications Bureau took over care of beacons at St. Regis and Lookout Pass. Six beacons are now in the care of the owners of the land they were erected on, six are in the care of a non-profit, Idaho Aviation Heritage, and four are in the care of local governments. Due to their historical significance in the state, the beacons at Homestake Pass, Canyon Resort, MacDonald Pass, Silver Bow, Spokane, Lookout Pass, St. Regis, Whitetail are in the process of being listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The strawberry Mountain beacon was demolished in the summer of 2021. MDT's Aeronautics Division removed the beacon and donated it to the Montana Historical Society.

1999 American Le Mans Series

The 1999 American Le Mans Series was the inaugural season of the IMSA American Le Mans Series, and is now recognised as the 29th season of the IMSA GT Championship. It was a series for Le Mans Prototypes (LMP) and Grand Touring (GT) race cars divided into three classes: LMP, GTS, and GT. It began March 20, 1999, and ended November 7, 1999, after eight races.
The American Le Mans Series officially replaced the dwindling IMSA GT Championship after the 1998 season. The Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO), which organized the 24 Hours of Le Mans, allowed IMSA's owner Don Panoz to create a series closely modeled after the formula used at Le Mans. The first official ACO-backed event had been held at the 1998 Petit Le Mans, which was part of the IMSA GT season but allowed ACO-spec cars to compete. The success of the event allowed Panoz to form the American Le Mans Series, which continued until its merger with Grand-Am in 2013.
Schedule.
Originally the season finale was supposed to be the Grand Prix of San Diego held on a 1.5 mile Road course at the former Naval Training Center. However, the season finale would eventually be moved to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway due to construction delays.

Firewater (Tha Alkaholiks album)

Firewater is the fifth and final studio album by American hip hop group Tha Alkaholiks. It was released on January 24, 2006, via Waxploitation/Koch Records. Recording sessions took place at Street Soul Studios in Los Angeles. Production was handled by members E-Swift and J-Ro, The Rural, Breakmecanix, Danger Mouse, Evidence and Keezo Kane. It features guest appearances from Bishop Lamont, King T and Styliztik Jones.
Critical reception.
"Firewater" was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67, based on nine reviews.
Soren Baker of "Los Angeles Times" called it "a rare modern-day rap album that is as fun as it is good". Nathan Rabin of "The A.V. Club" resumed: "far from classic, but pretty damn fun nonetheless". "Spin" reviewer described the album as "like your favorite dive bar, it feels uncomfortably familiar".
In mixed reviews, AllMusic's Andy Kellman noticed: "what prevents the album from being on par with the likes of "21 &amp; Over" and "Coast II Coast" is that the MCs have slowed a little with age". Adrian Covert of "Prefix" magazine wrote: "the members of Tha Alkaholiks may not have wrapped up their stellar career with the bang many had hoped for, but I'll still drink to this". Eric Neigher of "Slant" magazine stated "much of "Firewater" has a blast-from-the-past feel". Michael Frauenhofer of "PopMatters" wrote: "it may not be their best album, but where it doesn’t really add to their legacy, neither does it really tarnish". "NOW" magazine reviewer found out that "their beats and rhymes reflect none of the punchliney fun they used to have".

Sai Mun district

Sai Mun (, ; , ) is a district of Yasothon province in northeastern Thailand.
History.
Sai Mun village was formerly a village of Yasothon District, when it was still part of Ubon Ratchathani province. The village changed locations around the time of King Rama V when an epidemic caused villagers to abandon their homes and start a new village two kilometers away. At the site of their new village, which is present-day Sai Mun village, the villagers brought sand and soil from various sacred and revered places, and scattered it around the perimeter of their new home, to drive off the epidemic. It was from this ceremony that the village received its name.
Later, Sai Mun was given "tambon" status, and in 1968, Sanitary district ("khet sukhaphiban") Sai Mun was created.
After the separation of Yasothon from Ubon in 1972, on 15 May 1975, Sai Mun was elevated to a minor district ("king amphoe"), taking four "tambons" from Mueang Yasothon District: Sai Mun, Du Lat, Dong Mafai, and Na Wiang.
In 1978, "tambon" Phai was reassigned from Kut Chum district to King Amphoe Sai Mun.
On 26 July 1984, the minor district was elevated to a district, and on 25 May 1999 Sanitary District Sai Mun was elevated to township ("thesaban tambon") status.
Geography.
Neighboring districts are (from the northeast clockwise) Kut Chum and Mueang Yasothon of Yasothon Province, and Selaphum of Roi Et province.
Administration.
The district is divided into five sub-districts ("tambons") with 53 villages ("mubans").
Education.
Primary schools.
As of 2003, Sai Mun had 25 primary schools with 2,737 students.
Secondary schools.
As of 2003, Sai Mun had two secondary schools with 1,724 students:

NOS (drink)

NOS is an energy drink sold in cans. The drink was also distributed in a bottle designed to look like a NOS (Nitrous Oxide Systems) tank but this bottle has been discontinued. Formerly a property of the Coca-Cola Company, it is currently produced by Monster Beverage and licensed by Holley Performance, which owns the trademark. NOS contains 160 mg of caffeine, with an unknown amount of taurine and guarana. L-Theanine was removed as a "CMPLX6" ingredient in 2016, with inositol becoming listed as one of the six featured ingredients on the can. NOS Energy is currently available in Original, GT Grape, and Sonic Sour.
History.
In February 2005, the Fuze Beverage company launched the beverage. The name "NOS" was licensed from Holley Performance Products, which manufactures the Nitrous Oxide Systems (NOS) brand of automotive nitrous injection systems. According to Holley, NOS is the first automotive product to have a consumable food product share its name and logo. In February 2007, Fuze was purchased by the Coca-Cola Company, which transferred the NOS licence to Coca-Cola. On June 12, 2015, Coca-Cola announced the transfer of its energy division, including NOS and Full Throttle, to Monster Beverage.
Team NOS.
NOS has been involved in various forms of motorsports as its main source of advertising. Team NOS currently consists of NASCAR Cup Series driver Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Formula Drift driver Chris Forsberg, World of Outlaws drivers Sheldon Haudenschild and Tyler Courtney along with Ultimate Drift Brasil driver Erick Medici and YouTuber TJ Hunt. They also are the title sponsor of the World of Outlaws Sprint Cars, known officially as the “World of Outlaws NOS Energy Drink Sprint Cars”. They are the title sponsor of the Knoxville Nationals.
NASCAR driver Kyle Busch and off-road driver Brian Deegan are former members of Team NOS. Busch became a NOS Energy driver in 2008 when he first joined Joe Gibbs Racing. He has raced the No. 18 NOS Energy Toyota Camry to victory lane a record number of times in the Xfinity Series, where he is the all-time leader in race wins, initially from 2008 until 2011, when he switched to then-rival Monster Energy in 2012.
Following Monster's acquisition of Coca-Cola's energy beverage products, and a corporate decision to realign the Busch Brothers, both of whom are affiliated with Monster Beverage, Kyle was aligned with NOS Energy in 2016. In the fall of 2016, Monster Beverage released its newest flavor "NOS Rowdy" which was inspired by Kyle Busch and his nickname "Rowdy". The sponsorship ended after the 2018 season. The sponsorship would be switched back to Monster Energy in 2019. Kyle Busch ultimately started his own energy drink and ended his sponsorship with Monster and NOS. 
In 2019, NOS became the title sponsor of the World of Outlaws Sprint Car Series, replacing Craftsman Tools. NOS is also the primary sponsor of World of Outlaws NOS Energy Drink Sprint Cars Series driver, Sheldon Haudenschild.
Ingredients.
Ingredients are carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium hexametaphosphate (preservative), caffeine, taurine, natural flavors, acacia, potassium sorbate (preservative), glycerol ester of rosin, inositol, sucralose, yellow 5, calcium disodium edta (preservative), pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), yellow 6, guarana, and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12).

Toshio Miyazaki

 was a career officer in the Imperial Japanese Navy. He gained notoriety in the United States after his arrest and subsequent deportation for espionage activities. A protégé of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, during the Pacific War his anticipated promotion to the senior staff of the Combined Fleet was not realized due to Yamamoto’s death, and he ended the war with the rank of captain.
Biography.
A native of Kobe in Hyogo Prefecture, Miyazaki graduated from the 48th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, rated 5th of his class of 171 cadets. His classmates included Tamotsu Oishi. He was commissioned as an ensign in 1921. After graduating from torpedo warfare school, he served as Torpedo Officer on the light cruiser and the heavy cruiser .
During his term at the 30th class of Navy Staff College, Miyazaki came under criticism for sabotaging a war game exercise which was unfairly weighed so that the team playing the Japanese side would always defeat the team playing the American side. His actions were supported by Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa and he was allowed to graduate. Afterwards, as a lieutenant commander, he was sent to Stanford University in California from 1933 for further studies, but his real role was to work in naval intelligence to build a spy ring and gather information on American military activities on the west coast of the United States. Operating under the name of “Mr. Tanni”, he recruited former Navy yeoman Harry Thomas Thompson, in San Pedro, California in the run-up to World War II. Thompson agreed to board U.S. Navy ships dressed in a yeoman's uniform, for the purpose of gathering information from the crews. Through this and other methods, he was able to sell engineering, gunnery, and tactical information about the Pacific Fleet that was mainly based in nearby San Diego at that time. Unfortunately for Thompson, the Director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), Capt. William D. Puleston, took a personal interest in so-called language students like Miyazaki. His suspicions were borne out when Japanese coded radio messages were intercepted and deciphered. On Thompson’s arrest in 1936, Miyazaki fled back to Japan. The incident was highly publicized, including in a 1943 novel by Alan Hynd, "Betrayal from the East: The Inside Story of Japanese Spies in America" which was subsequently made into a movie.
After returning to Japan, Miyazaki was promoted to commander on 1 December 1936. He was given command of the destroyer from 15 December 1938 until 20 October 1939. At the start of the Pacific War, on 15 October 1941, Miyazaki was promoted to captain and served on the staff of the IJN 5th Fleet. He subsequently was promoted to captain and served as commander of Destroyer Division 17 in the Southwest Pacific from 17 June to 18 December 1943, followed by a posting as senior instructor at the Torpedo School in Oppama. He was then made captain of the aircraft carrier followed by . He was still captain of the "Katsuragi" when the war ended, and was retained until the end of 1946 to command the vessel as a repatriation ship, bringing back former Japanese soldiers, POWs, and civilians from southeast Asia and Australia.

Beach Brawl

Beach Brawl was the only live professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by Herb Abrams' Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). The event took place on June 9, 1991 at the Manatee Civic Center in Palmetto, Florida.
Eight professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Steve Williams defeated Bam Bam Bigelow to become the inaugural SportsChannel Television Champion in the finals of a sixteen-man tournament. The inaugural Women's World Champion was also crowned at the event as Rockin' Robin defeated Candi Devine to become the inaugural women's champion of the company. The event was widely considered a failure because of its extremely low attendance and pay-per-view buyrate of 0.10.
Event.
Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, Boris Zhukov defeated Paul Samson in a dark match.
Preliminary matches.
The opening match of the event was a tag team match pitting The Blackhearts (Apocalypse and Destruction) against Fire Cat and Jim Cooper. Blackhearts performed a bearhug and diving leg drop combination on Cooper for the win while Luna Vachon strangled Fire Cat.
A Street Fight was scheduled to take place between Don Muraco and Terry Gordy but Muraco suffered an injury and Johnny Ace substituted for him. The match ended in a double count-out after both men brawled with each other throughout the crowd.
Masked Confusion (Brian Blair and Jim Brunzell) took on The Power Twins (Larry and David Power). Near the end of the match, Brunzell tried to perform a sunset flip on David but David prevented it by holding the ropes and then Blair performed a sunset flip on David for the win.
Rockin' Robin took on Candi Devine for the inaugural Women's World Championship. Near the end of the match, Devine missed a charge at Robin in the corner and Robin rolled up Devine to pin her and win the title.
Paul Orndorff took on Colonel DeBeers in a Strap match. Near the end of the match, DeBeers tried to release himself by getting out of the strap wrangled around his neck by a back body drop but Orndoff countered that with a spike piledriver for the win. The match was followed by a Captain Lou's Corner interview segment hosted by Captain Lou Albano featuring The Blackhearts and Luna Vachon as his guests, but Albano said he disliked his guests, dropped the mic and left.
Bob Backlund took on Ivan Koloff. Backlund pinned Koloff with a roll-up for the win after hitting a back body drop to a charging Koloff.
The penultimate match of the event was a tag team match pitting Wet'N'Wild (Steve Ray and Sunny Beach) against Cactus Jack and Bob Orton, Jr. John Tolos was tossed into a shark cage suspended above the ring by Ray and Beach. Near the end of the match, Tolos interfered by throwing brass knuckles from the cage but they knocked out Jack, allowing Ray to pin him for the win.
Main event match.
The main event was the final round match of a tournament for the inaugural SportsChannel Television Championship between Steve Williams and Bam Bam Bigelow. Williams powerslammed Bigelow to win the match and become the inaugural SportsChannel Television Champion.
Reception.
"Beach Brawl" was a major failure as it was only able to generate a crowd of 500 people at the 4000-seat Manatee Civic Center with a low buyrate of 0.10. The event also received negative reviews from critics. Arnold Furious of "411Mania" gave the event a 5.0 rating out of 10, stating "most of the undercard is relatively inoffensive. I say “relatively” because the UWF was so bad at times that a passable show would be good by their standards. There were some UWF-isms creeping onto show though. The count out in the street fight is an obvious one but there are several completely non-competitive matches and their titles mean nothing. The booking never makes any sense."
Adam Nedeff of "411Mania" gave a rating of 2.5 out of 10, citing "Underwhelming finishes (Tolos in the shark cage), nonsensical booking (Captain's Corner, the street fight, a seven-minute main event, Backlund squashing Koloff), and just-plain-disappointing matches."
Aftermath.
UWF did not produce any other pay-per-view events due to "Beach Brawl" being a massive failure, but they produced a major television special called Blackjack Brawl in 1994 that served as the promotion's final show.
Results.
SportsChannel Television Championship tournament brackets.
The tournament to determine the inaugural SportsChannel Television Champion began on April 7, 1991 and concluded with the tournament final at Beach Brawl.

Robert Brownlee

Robert Gregg Brownlee (October 21, 1942 – February 27, 1991) was an American chemist.
Biography.
Robert Brownlee was born October 21, 1942, in South Dakota. He founded Brownlee Labs in the 1970s, in the San Francisco Bay area, a manufacturer of columns and pumps for high-performance liquid chromatography systems.
Bob Brownlee took the initiative "along with Tom Jupille, Steve Bakalyar, Nelson Cooke, Jerry Higgins and Ron Majors" to form the Bay Area Chromatography Colloquium. Bob Stevenson is quoted as saying in his "Nine Lives of the California Separation Science Society" that Brownlee Labs was "certainly one of the globe's leaders in HPLC column technology."
In the 1980s, when Robert Brownlee was diagnosed with AIDS-related complex, he sold his company to Applied Biosystems of Foster City, California, in 1984. (Applied later merged with Perkin-Elmer).
Sometime later, he began a new company, which was viewed by Applied as a competitor. A lawsuit was instituted and later settled ("Brownlee v. Applied Biosystems, Inc.", 1989-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶ 68, (N.D. Cal. 1989) 8,14).
In 1990, he was interviewed for an article in The Scientist about Applied Biosystems. "If you produce the first product for these virgins [scientists without such equipment], you have a big value added, and you can charge a big price for your product," Brownlee says. "That's the reason Applied Biosystems did so well."
He also formed the Robert Brownlee Foundation, a private family foundation which supports, with grants, K–12 science. In addition, the contributions of his foundation made possible a project introducing children to marine sciences, aboard the 90-foot research vessel the "Robert G. Brownlee", built in 1998 and run by the Marine Science Institute (San Francisco Bay) of Redwood City, California.
He died on February 27, 1991, of AIDS.

Eldama Ravine

Eldama Ravine (sometimes known by the short form E/Ravine) is a town in Baringo County, Kenya, a few miles north of the equator, geographical coordinates 0° 30' 0" North, 35° 43' 0" East. It was established as an administrative point by British colonialists and later served as a transit route for lumber harvested from surrounding forests.
It was previously the headquarters of the former Koibatek District and Eldama Ravine Constituency.
It has a population of 45,799 (2009 census). It is largely an agricultural trade point producing world popular commercial rose flowers. It is fairly cosmopolitan, having residents from more than half of Kenya's ethnic tribes.
Naming.
Eldama Ravine was first known as Shimoni due to the presence of a narrow ravine through which the Eldama Ravine River flows. Eldama, the non-English part of the name, is derived from the Maasai word ‘eldama’, which means the place of sunshine. It had two areas known as Lembus lowland or Soi (Mogotio constituency) and Lembus highland or Mosop (Eldama Ravine constituency).
The British East African Company (IBEACO) established the town in 1887 as a victualing center for caravans moving from the coast to Mumias. Later during the British colonial period, it served as the headquarters of the Baringo District and Naivasha province, then under the Uganda Protectorate.

BAR domain

In molecular biology, BAR domains are highly conserved protein dimerisation domains that occur in many proteins involved in membrane dynamics in a cell. The BAR domain is banana-shaped and binds to membrane via its concave face. It is capable of sensing membrane curvature by binding preferentially to curved membranes. BAR domains are named after three proteins that they are found in: Bin, Amphiphysin and Rvs.
BAR domains occur in combinations with other domains.
Many BAR family proteins contain alternative lipid specificity domains that help target these protein to particular membrane compartments. Some also have SH3 domains that bind to dynamin and thus proteins like amphiphysin and endophilin are implicated in the orchestration of vesicle scission.
N-BAR domain.
Some BAR domain containing proteins have an N-terminal amphipathic helix preceding the BAR domain. This helix inserts (like in the epsin ENTH domain) into the membrane and induces curvature, which is stabilised by the BAR dimer. Amphiphysin, endophilin, BRAP1/bin2 and nadrin are examples of such proteins containing an N-BAR. The Drosophila amphiphysin N-BAR (DA-N-BAR) is an example of a protein with a preference for negatively charged surfaces.
Human proteins containing this domain.
AMPH; ARHGAP17; ARHGAP44; BIN1; BIN2; BIN3;
SH3BP1; SH3GL1; SH3GL2; SH3GL3; SH3GLB1; SH3GLB2.
F-BAR (EFC) domain.
F-BAR domains (for FCH-BAR, or EFC for Extended FCH Homology) are BAR domains that are extensions of the already established FCH domain. They are frequently found at the amino terminus of proteins. They can bind lipid membranes and can tubulate lipids in vitro and in vivo, but their exact physiological role still is under investigation. Examples of the F-BAR domain family are CIP4/FBP17/Toca-1, Syndapins (also called PACSINs) and muniscins. Gene knock-out of syndapin I in mice revealed that this brain-enriched isoform of the syndapin family is crucial for proper size control of synaptic vesicles and thereby indeed helps to define membrane curvature a physiological process. Work of the lab of Britta Qualmann also demonstrated that syndapin I is crucial for proper targeting of the large GTPase dynamin to membranes.
Sorting nexins.
The sorting nexin family of proteins includes several members that possess a BAR domain, including the well characterized SNX1 and SNX9.

Quintet (Prokofiev)

Sergei Prokofiev's Quintet in G minor, Op. 39 is a piece of chamber music for oboe, clarinet, violin, viola and double bass, written in 1924. The quintet, closely related to Prokofiev's ballet, "Trapèze", contains six movements and lasts 20–25 minutes.
Background.
In 1924, when Prokofiev was staying in Paris, a travelling troupe commissioned a chamber ballet from him. However, the ensemble that provided music accompaniment to the troupe only contained five members. This provided Prokofiev an opportunity to write more chamber music. His most recent chamber piece had been the "Overture on Hebrew Themes", Op. 34 (1919).
Later, Prokofiev incorporated the ballet music into two pieces: Quintet, Op. 39 (1924) and Divertissement Op. 43 (1925–29).
Movements.
The related ballet, "Trapèze", reconstructed in 2002, is in five movements:

Chris Schacht

Christopher Cleland Schacht (born 6 December 1946) is a former Australian politician and member of the South Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). He was born in Melbourne and educated at the University of Adelaide and Wattle Park Teachers College.
Career.
Schacht's political career started as a state party official in 1969 during the Don Dunstan era. In 1987, he entered Federal Parliament as a Labor Party Senator for South Australia. He was Minister for Science and Small Business and Minister assisting the Prime Minister for Science in the Keating Labor Government from March 1993 to March 1994 and then Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction until Labor's defeat at the 1996 election. He left the parliament in June 2002 after 15 years as a Senator and 33 years in Australian politics.
Post-parliamentary career.
In 2006, Senator Robert Ray said of Schacht's "long-winded critiques" of factionalism within the Labor party that "no-one practised factionalism harder than he did. But once he lost influence in his own faction, he condemned all factions." Schacht has openly criticised the influence that he believes trade unions have within the Labor party.
Schacht has supported uranium mining and the prospect of nuclear waste storage in South Australia. He told ABC's "Stateline" in 2006 that storing the world's nuclear waste "may be the safest thing we can do for the world. Secondly, the world will pay a large amount of money in the future for some place like Australia or outback South Australia to store nuclear waste safely in a safe, in a geologically sound area, with a stable political system."
In 2008 Schacht was appointed as a Director of Marathon Resources. The company's exploration for uranium in Arkaroola later became a subject of controversy. A series of environmental breaches resulted in the revocation of the company's exploration license and the establishment of the Arkaroola Protection Zone.
As of 2015, Schacht is a registered political lobbyist in South Australia. His clients include Pilatus Australia, Liebherr Australia, PMB Defence and Basetec Services. Former clients include VIPAC Engineers and Scientists. Schacht is also the chairman of the Australia China Development Company and an ambassador for the National Secular Lobby.
Schacht is the President of the Australian Volleyball Federation. In October 2006, he was elected to the Legal Commission of the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball for a four-year term.

Mykola Pymonenko

Mykola Kornylovych Pymonenko (; 9 March 1862 – 8 April [O.S. 26 March] 1912) was a Ukrainian realist painter who lived and worked in Kyiv. One of his students was Kazimir Malevich, whose early works were influenced by Pymonenko.
He is best known for his urban and rural genre scenes of farmers, country folk and working-class people.
Biography.
Mykola Kornylovych Pymonenko was born 9 March 1862 in the village of on the outskirts of Kyiv. His father was a master iconographer, of Ukrainian descent. After working as his father's assistant, Pymonenko went on to study icon painting at the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. 
In 1876, Pymonenko's work was seen by Mykola Murashko, one of the founders of the Kyiv Art School, who was impressed by the young artist, and lobbied the school's financial backers to allow him to study there for free. Two years later, Pymonenko enrolled at the school, where he worked with the painters Khariton Platonov, Murashko, and others. He studied there until 1882. After his examination work was sent to the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in Saint Petersburg in 1881, he received a licence to teach drawing at lower secondary school level, and was able to audit classes at the Academy. He married the daughter of Vladimir Orlovsky, one of his instructors.
From 1882 to 1884 Pymonenko studied at the St Petersburg Academy of Arts. That year, both his poor health (possibly caused by tuberculosis) and a lack of funds caused him to return to Kyiv, where he found work as a drawing teacher at a private school. After the school closed in 1901, he moved to the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute of Emperor Alexander II. From 1906 he taught at the Kyiv Art School, Kazimir Malevich being one of his most notable students.
In 1897, Pymonenko was involved in decorating Kyiv's St Volodymyr's Cathedral and was awarded the Order of Saint Anne for his work there. From 1893 he was a member of the Peredvizhniki, and in 1899 he became a full member of the group, and was named an 'academician' in 1904. He won a gold medal at the Salon in 1909 for his exhibited painting "Hopak", now in the Louvre. In addition to the Louvre, Pymonenko's work was also of interest in Germany. In 1904, one of the Munich museums acquired the painting "Maundy Thursday". The National Art Museum has an author's copy of the smaller painting from the late 1900s.
Pymonenko died in 1912 after a short illness. He was buried at the Lukyanivka Cemetery. His 1913 posthumous exhibition at the Academy of Arts featured 184 paintings, 419 sketches and 112 pencil drawings. A street was named after him in 1959, and, in 1997 a museum devoted to him was opened in , a village he visited regularly each year. Several of his works have alternate versions, painted years apart.
Reputation.
Pymonenko fell out of favour with the Peredvizhniki when one of his paintings, "Going Home", was used (apparently without his permission) by the Shustov Vodka Company to promote their "" (a type of horilka). He was accused of having become "corrupted" and was forced to sue the company to have the image removed.
In 1905, Pymonenko complained to his friend Lazarevsky: "They (Ukrainians) say that I am a renegade, that I do not love my homeland, that I do not give what is needed that my plots are pale, but that all this is not true, not true." Mykola Golubed waved: “It is clear from those words that Pymonenko was wronged as a citizen, but he was praised as an artist by the critics. Pymonenko was a true link between the painting of Shevchenko and Trutovsky."

Leonotis leonurus

Leonotis leonurus, also known as wild dagga and lion's ear, is a plant species in the mint family Lamiaceae. It is a broadleaf evergreen shrub, native to South Africa, where it is very common, with a wide altitudinal range from 5 m up to 1980 m. It is known for its medicinal properties. The main psychoactive component of "Leonotis leonurus" is hypothesized to be related to the presence of leonurine or labdanes; "Leonotis leonurus" has been confirmed to contain leonurine according to peer reviewed journal published phytochemical analysis. Like other plants in the mint family, it also contains marrubin. The word "dagga" comes from Afrikaans, and derives in turn from the Khoikhoi "dachab". The word "dagga" has been extended to include cannabis in Afrikaans and South African English, so the use of "wild" serves to distinguish "Leonotis leonurus" from this.
Description.
The shrub grows tall (rarely to ), and wide, with softly woody stems. The leaves are medium-dark green, long, and aromatic when crushed. The plant has hairy tubular 4–5 cm orange flowers, 3–11 together in tiered whorls (verticillasters) typical of the mint family, that encircle the square stems. They rise up to above the foliage, with flowering in summer (November to January) in some areas, but autumn to winter (April to June) in other areas.
Variation in flower colour.
A white-flowered variety "Leonotis leonurus" var. "albiflora" was described by George Bentham, but is not now accepted as distinct at varietal rank; yellow cultivars also exist.
Ecology.
The native habitat of "Leonotis leonurus" is among rocks and in grasslands of southern Africa, particularly in wetter eastern and southern areas. It attracts nectivorous birds (mainly sunbirds), as well as various insects such as bees and butterflies. The flowers' mainly orange to orange-red colour and tubular shape are indicative of its co-evolution with African sunbirds, which have curved bills suited to feeding from tubular flowers. The butterfly "Cacyreus lingeus" (Lycenidae) uses the foliage as a larval food plant.
Cultivation.
"Leonotis leonurus" is cultivated as an ornamental plant for its copious orange blossom spikes, and is used as specimen shrub or a screen in gardens and parks. It is moderately drought tolerant, and a nectar source for birds and butterflies in landscape settings. It was introduced to Europe in the 1600s.
Lion's ear can be found introduced as an ornamental plant in other subtropical and Mediterranean climate regions beyond South Africa, such as California, Hawaii, and Australia where it has naturalised in some areas. In cooler climates it is used as an annual and winter conservatory plant.
Pharmacology and toxicology.
Marrubiin has both antioxidant and cardioprotective properties and has shown to significantly improve myocardial function.
Docosatetraenoylethanolamide (DEA) is a cannabinoid that acts on the cannabinoid (CB1) receptor which has been found in the whole flower extract of the putative variety "Leonotis leonurus" var. "albiflora".
"Leonotis leonurus" contains several labdane diterpene–based compounds such as Hispanolone, Leonurun, Leonurine and Leoleorins. C-N
Leonurine (also known as SCM-198 in research) is a pseudoalkaloid that has been isolated from Leonotis leonurus, Leonotis nepetifolia, Leonurus japonicus, Leonurus cardiaca (motherwort), Leonurus sibiricus, as well as other plants of family Lamiaceae.[citation needed] Leonurine is easily extracted into water.[1]
One experimental animal study suggests that the aqueous leaf extract of "Leonotis leonurus" possesses antinociceptive, antiinflammatory, and hypoglycemic properties.
An animal study in rats indicated that in high doses, lion's ear has significant toxicological adverse effects on organs, red blood cells, white blood cells, and other important bodily functions. Acute toxicity tests in animals caused death for those receiving a 3200 mg/kg dose. A 1600 mg/kg extract led to changes in red blood cells, haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, platelets, and white blood cells.
Traditional uses.
Infusions made from flowers, seeds, leaves, or stems are widely used to treat tuberculosis, jaundice, muscle cramps, high blood pressure, diabetes, viral hepatitis, dysentery, and diarrhoea. The leaves, roots, and bark are used as an emetic for snakebites, and bee and scorpion stings. The fresh stem juice is used as an infusion drink for "blood impurity" in some parts of South Africa.
Legal status.
Latvia.
"Leonotis leonurus" has been illegal in Latvia since November 2009, and is classified as a Schedule 1 drug. Possession of quantities up to 1 gram are fined up to 280 euros. Possession and distribution of larger quantities can be punished with up to 15 years in prison.
Poland.
"Leonotis leonurus" was banned in Poland in March 2009. Possession and distribution lead to criminal charges.

The ANTH domain is a membrane binding domain that shows weak specificity for PtdIns(4,5)P2. It was found in AP180 (homologous to CALM) endocytotic accessory protein that has been implicated in the formation of clathrin-coated pits. The domain is involved in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding and is a universal adaptor for nucleation of clathrin coats.
Its structure is a solenoid of 9 helices. The PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding residues are spread over several helices at the tip of the structure. The PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding sequence is Kx9Kx(K/R)(H/Y).

Richard Dominguez

Richard Dominguez (born Eufrancio Ricardo Dominguez September 22, 1960) is an American comic book artist and freelance storyboard illustrator. Best known for creating the popular series "El Gato Negro", Dominguez publishes his comics through his imprint and art studio, Azteca Productions. Dominguez also is well known for influencing other artists and creators in the pursuit of their own self-publishing ventures.
Biography.
Early life and career.
Richard Dominguez was born Eufrancio Ricardo Dominguez to Ricardo and Juanita Dominguez in Dallas, Texas on September 22, 1960. The second of seven children, Richard grew up in a section of West Dallas known during the Great Depression as 'The Devil's Back Porch'. Dominguez recalls his first exposure to comic books at the age of six when he began sneaking into his Uncle's room to read from his large comic book collections. In high school, Richard enrolled in Commercial Art and later took Life Drawing classes at a community college before taking a job at a local supermarket chain to create and paint point-of-purchase displays. During the late '80s and early '90s, Richard worked as an intern for several art and design studios, later designing logos for Semi-Pro Sports teams and small companies.
Creation of El Gato Negro.
Dominguez conceived El Gato Negro sometime in the mid-to-late '80s and originally planned to debut the character in a largely Mexican-American superhero group called "Team Tejas". Having placed more emphasis on El Gato Negro's character development than the other members, Dominguez abandoned the Team Tejas project for a later date, as he later recalled:
Various aspects of the character's personality and visual design were directly inspired by some of Dominguez's favorite comic book and classic pulp superheroes including "The Spirit", "The Crimson Avenger", "Daredevil", "Nightwing", "The Shadow", "The Phantom", "Zorro" and most noticeably "Batman". Elements from Japanese animation, manga, and martial arts films also aided in the development of El Gato Negro's costume design and equipment.
The example of Judge Margarito Garza's "Relampago" character persuaded Dominguez pursue his creation in a self-published format, the character making his first published appearance in his own self-titled series written and illustrated by Dominguez in 1993. The debut series proved popular and has since spawned a second series entitled """. The character's popularity has landed him guest-starring roles in several publications and other media including being featured in Mountain Dew's "Do the Dew"" Tour. Dominguez is currently in talks for a possible live-action film adaptation.
Azteca Productions.
Dominguez formed Azteca Productions in 1993, its first publication featuring the debut of El Gato Negro, in what is now considered the company's flagship title. Dominguez later debuted "Team Tejas" with the help of friend and writer Michael S. Moore in 1997. Publications were put to a halt during the rise and fall of the speculative market of the late '90s, allowing Dominguez to focus on his family life. He later returned in 2004 with a second series featuring Moore as writer and pencils by artist Efren Molina. Current projects include "Lucha Grande Comics" featuring the exploits of the original El Gato Negro, "[The Acolyte, Demon Hunter]"and Tonatiuh the Almighty.
Personal life.
Richard currently resides in Dallas, Texas with his wife Olga Dominguez and their four children.
Professional Amigos of Comic Art Society.
The Professional Amigos of Comic Art Society (PACAS) was a non-profit organization founded by comic book creators Richard Dominguez, Carlos Saldaña, Jose Martinez, and Fernando Rodriguez in 1995. The purpose of which was to unite various cartoonists, writers, colorists, letterers and publishers in the shared goal of using networking and dialogue between themselves in order to assist their various projects in the hopes of expanding the opportunities for social growth in the comic art community. The group later expanded to over fifty members, the majority of which lived in California, but also included international members such as Oscar Loyo and the ¡Ka-Boom! Estudio group from Mexico.

Marlborough Boys' College

Marlborough Boys' College is a state single-sex secondary school in Blenheim, New Zealand. The school was established as Marlborough High School in 1899 (renamed Marlborough College in 1919). The school in its current form was established in 1963, after Marlborough Girls' College was split off. Serving Years 9 to 13, the college has students as of .
History.
Overview.
The first board of Marlborough High School met on 13 November 1899. Three acres on Stephenson Street (1.2 hectares) were purchased for £600 and another were donated by Thomas Carter, taking the grounds through to Francis Street. Dr John Innes was appointed the first Head Teacher. The school opened in the Church Of Nativity Sunday School building on Alfred Street, on 26 March 1900, with 18 pupils attending on the first day. The cornerstone for the first school building on the Stephenson Street site was laid on 22 September 1900.
Marlborough High School was co-educational and fee paying with free places to those who could not afford it but who had proved themselves able in the proficiency examination. The change in name from Marlborough High School to Marlborough College was made in 1919.
In 1926 Mr Stewart (Headmaster) was awarded a travelling scholarship to visit junior high schools in Canada and the United States. The department of education was interested in incorporating a Junior High (Intermediate) into the college structure. In 1927 an intermediate (forms 1 and 2 or years 7 and 8 in current terminology) was established on the site with 275 pupils taking the total roll to 557. The intermediate continued on the site until 1957, when roll pressures required the establishment of Bohally Intermediate on Mclauchlan Street.
In 1963 the Marlborough Girls' College was founded and Marlborough Boys' College continued on the original site. The first official discussion on the division of the college having taken place in June 1947. Mr Insull, the Headmaster at the time, suggested that “the time would come when the board would have to consider the question of separate boys’ and girls’ schools ... and that the girls school might be established on the other side of town (Mclauchlan Street)". (Marlborough Express, June 10, 1947)
X Static FM89.
X Static FM was a radio station in the Marlborough Region of New Zealand which originated as a Marlborough College-based radio station, X-Static FM operated by "The X-Static Society." The station was based at the college and broadcast on 89FM with the callsign 2STA. Two years earlier the school ran a temporary radio station as part of a school fundraiser called Artyfacts FM. This station was the first FM broadcast in the South Island. X- Static went on air in February 1986 and only operated on a part-time basis during school lunch times and some evenings. The station was rebranded as "Marlborough's 89FM" in 1988 and remained at Marlborough Boys' College until 1989 when the station moved to new premises at the Blenheim Post Office Building; by this time the station was broadcasting from 6AM to 12AM. In 1990 the X-Static Society in partnership with Fifeshire FM from Nelson launched a new station "Sounds 93FM" using a commercial frequency purchased at auction from the government. Sounds FM broadcast in both Picton, Blenheim and Kaikoura.
Marlborough High School building development 1900–1919.
The college is located off Stephenson Street, with a large white building housing the English, maths and languages departments on the street front. In 2003–04 a new hall was built to the rear of the complex, and the music department was updated to include new music suites. It has a small swimming pool and is located in the vicinity of St Mary's church.
Proposed relocation.
The intention to relocate both Marlborough Boys' College and Marlborough Girls' College on the site currently occupied by MGC and Bohally Intermediate is being planned by a consortium led by construction company Naylor Love. Bohally Intermediate would relocate to the current MBC site on Stephenson Street. The relocation plan was scrapped in 2024.

Bella (2006 film)

Bella is a 2006 American drama film co-written, co-produced, and directed by Alejandro Gómez Monteverde, starring Eduardo Verastegui and Tammy Blanchard. Set in New York City, the film is about the events of one day and the impact on the characters' lives.
Plot.
In New York City, José works as a cook in a Mexican restaurant owned by his stern chef brother, Manny. When the establishment is getting ready to open, Nina, a waitress, arrives late for the second day in a row and Manny fires her on the spot. As Nina leaves, she drops a teddy bear. José retrieves it and chases her into the subway to hand it back. When asked why she was late, she tells him she is pregnant and was ill from morning sickness. José offers her a stroll around the city, which she accepts. He takes Nina to Manny's colleague's restaurant to recommend her for a waitressing position. While they dine and wait for the response, Nina tells him that she does not intend to proceed with her pregnancy and is seriously considering an abortion, partly because the father is uninterested in supporting her and she is broke.
Nina agrees to go with him to the beach, but José says he has to go back to the restaurant and get his wallet. When he returns, Manny rebukes him for flaking at work for Nina. After José argues with his brother over his oppressive demeanor, Manny fires him. José then boards a train with Nina to his home. During the trip, he tries to persuade Nina to give up the unborn child for adoption, but she argues in favor of abortion because she does not want to bring a child into the world whom she is not prepared to love. José takes her to his parents' house and introduces her to his family. He takes Nina into the garage and shows her his old car, which he reveals he had been driving with his manager a few years earlier, during the peak of his career as a soccer player, and accidentally hit and killed a little girl. His manager frantically suggested fleeing the crime, but he instead chose to take responsibility. José was then sentenced to four years in prison for involuntary manslaughter. After being released, he tried unsuccessfully multiple times to reconcile with the girl's single mother, and the tragedy has since left him depressed and suicidal.
José's parents invite Nina to have dinner, during which time she finds out that Manny was adopted. They tell her she is always welcome to stay at their house. José takes Nina to the nearby beach, where she tells him how her father's death when she was twelve caused her and her mother severe emotional pain. Because she had no siblings and spent her childhood taking care of her emotionally crippled mother, she tells José how fortunate he is to have a loving family, and hopes someday she would meet a man who loves her and is as capable of raising a family as her father was. The next day, before they each go their own way, Nina says she needs a friend to be there for her the next week. José walks back to the restaurant and reconciles with Manny.
Several years later, José is seen playing on a beach with a young girl. When Nina arrives she meets what is implied to be her daughter, Bella, whom she had considered aborting but then gave over for José to adopt. Mother and daughter exchange gifts, Nina tearfully giving Bella the teddy bear her father had gifted her as a child, while Bella hands Nina a seashell. Afterward, all three stroll down the beach together.
Production.
"Bella" marks the feature directorial debut for Alejandro Gómez Monteverde, who co-wrote its original screenplay with Patrick Million. "Bella" features Manuel Pérez, Angélica Aragón, Jamie Tirelli, Armando Riesco, Ali Landry and Ewa Da Cruz. The film was produced by Sean Wolfington, Eduardo Verástegui, Leo Severino, Alejandro Gómez Monteverde, and Denise Pinckley. Executive producers were J. Eustace Wolfington, Sean Wolfington, Ana Wolfington and Stephen McEveety. It was financed by producers Sean Wolfington and Eustace Wolfington.
Stephen McEveety, producer of "Braveheart" and "The Passion of the Christ", consulted on the script; after the film was finished, he signed on as an executive producer to help market it. "Bella" is McEveety's first release under his new company Mpower Pictures.
"Bella" was produced by Metanoia Films. Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions acquired United States distribution rights to the film and released it on October 26, 2007.
Reception.
Robert Koehler of "Variety" wrote, "with its storyline based on such inexplicable behavior, "Bella" is seriously behind the dramatic eight ball, and trusts that the effective chemistry between the two leads will help auds ignore the many narrative potholes." Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" said in a less favorable review, "if "Bella" (the title doesn’t make sense until the last scene) is a mediocre cup of mush, the response to it suggests how desperate some people are for an urban fairy tale with a happy ending, no matter how ludicrous."
Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film 3 stars out of 4, describing it as: "a heart-tugger with the confidence not to tug too hard." He concluded his review by writing, "the movie is not profound, but it's not stupid. It's about lovable people having important conversations and is not pro-choice or pro-life but simply in favor of his [Verástegui] feelings -- and hers [Blanchard], if she felt free to feel them. The movie is a little more lightweight than the usual People's Choice Awards winner at Toronto, but why not? It was the best-liked film at the 2006 festival, and I can understand that."
"Bella" resonated with adoption and anti-abortion organizations, who gave the movie high marks for its purported pro-adoption themes.
Awards and honors.
"Bella" won the People's Choice Award at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.
Bella won the Heartland Film Festival's Grand Prize Award Winner for Best Dramatic Feature and the Crystal Heart Awards for Monteverde as writer/director/producer.
"Bella"s filmmakers received the Smithsonian Institution's "Legacy Award" for the film's positive contribution to Latino art and culture. "This movie depicts the culture but also transcends it," said Pilar O'Leary, executive director of the Smithsonian Institution's Latino Center. "It has universal appeal."
"Bella" received the Tony Bennett Media Excellence Award. Bennett said "Bella" is "a perfect film, an artistic masterpiece that will live in people's hearts forever."
"Bella" was listed by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Office for Film and Broadcasting on their list of the top-ten films of 2007, noting that "Bella" presents an "affirmative pro-life message", along with "themes of self-forgiveness, reconciliation and redemption that should resonate deeply".
The director of "Bella", Alejandro Monteverde, was given the "Outstanding American by Choice" Award at a White House reception for "Bella"'s positive contribution to Latino art and culture in the United States. Monteverde was also invited to join the First Lady, Laura Bush, in her private box to watch the State of the Union address.
The Mexican Embassy honored the film and gave "Bella" a screening at their annual Cinco de Mayo celebration.
"Bella" broke the record for a Latino-themed film in total box-office earnings and box-office average per screen for films released in 2007. It was the top-rated movie on "The New York Times" Readers' Poll, Yahoo and Fandango. "The Wall Street Journal" said "Bella" was "the fall's biggest surprise" and stated that "after only four weeks in release "Bella" has total sales of $5.2 million." "Bella" ended its U.S. theatrical release with more than $10 million in domestic box office, finishing the year in the top 10-grossing independent films of 2007.

St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church (Manhattan)

The St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, officially the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine, is a church and shrine in the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, New York City. It is administered by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and has been developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, based upon a design by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The church was consecrated on July 4, 2022.
St. Nicholas replaced the original church of the same name that was destroyed during the September 11 attacks in 2001—the only house of worship, and only building outside the original World Trade Center complex, to be completely destroyed. The new church is located in Liberty Park, overlooking the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum. Its architecture draws from Byzantine influences, namely the Church of the Savior and the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, as well as from the Parthenon in Athens. In addition to serving as a Greek Orthodox parish, St. Nicholas acts as a "House of Prayer for all people" that functions as a national shrine and community center, incorporating a secular bereavement space, social hall, and various educational and interfaith programs.
Initially scheduled to open in 2016, St. Nicholas' rebuilding effort was beset by delays, cost overruns, and claims of financial impropriety. In 2019, the nonprofit Friends of St. Nicholas was founded to help complete the project, which continued under the auspices of the newly elected Archbishop Elpidophoros. The church was partially opened for a memorial service commemorating the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. The church fully opened on December 6, 2022, the Feast of Saint Nicholas.
Early history.
Greek immigrants founded the congregation of St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in 1916. Parishioners initially worshiped in the dining room of a hotel on Morris Street owned by Stamatis Kalamarides. In 1919, five families raised $25,000 to purchase a new location for the church, a three-story tavern on 155 Cedar Street that was originally built in the 1830s as a private home. The modest structure was converted into a church and given a fourth story, holding worship services by 1922.
St. Nicholas was only wide, long, and tall. It was originally an old calendar church, but in 1993 began holding Wednesday services according to the Gregorian calendar. It was notable for its small size, unusual location, and juxtaposition with the large modern skyscrapers in the area—all other adjacent buildings had been demolished, leaving the church surrounded on three sides by a parking lot.
Before the September 11 attacks, the church had a dedicated congregation of about 70 families led by Father John Romas. On Wednesdays, the building was open to the public, often receiving visitors that were not Greek Orthodox; in addition to local residents and Greek immigrants, St. Nicholas attracted Greek shipping magnates passing through New York City.
September 11, 2001.
The building was completely destroyed when the South Tower of the original World Trade Center collapsed, after being struck by United Airlines Flight 175 during the September 11 attacks. No one was inside when the church was destroyed; the church sexton and an electrician were able to escape only minutes before.
A 50-year-old parishioner named Bill Tarazonas, who was in the church that morning before the South Tower collapsed, said:
Very little of the church's contents were recovered. Among the most valuable physical possessions lost were some relics of St Nicholas, St Catherine, and St Sava, which had been donated to the church by Nicholas II, the last tsar of Russia; they were removed from their safe on holy days for veneration. Archbishop Demetrios expressed that having the saints' relics intermingled with the remains of the attack's victims served to sanctify the site further. Among the items eventually found were the damaged icons of St. Dionysios of Zakynthos, the Life-giving Spring (), and a handful of miscellaneous religious items. These are to be displayed in an exhibit in the new church dedicated to its predecessor.
Rebuilding.
Congregation members and Father Romas temporarily relocated to Sts. Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Brooklyn.
On December 6, 2001, the Feast Day of St. Nicholas, Archbishop Demetrios of America, joined by Archbishop Iakovos and area clergy, celebrated a somber vespers and memorial service near the location where the church once stood.
Following its collapse, donations of almost $2 million were received, as well as additional pledges of construction materials and appointments for the complete rebuilding of the church. The city of Bari, Italy, where the relics of Saint Nicholas were originally bestowed, donated $500,000. The Government of Greece contributed $750,000 to these efforts, and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople gave $50,000.
Meanwhile, the plans for rebuilding the World Trade Center complex included building a new St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church quite close to the original location, on the elevated Liberty Park, diagonally from One World Trade Center.
2008–2011: plans and deal breakdown.
On July 23, 2008, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reached a deal with the leaders of the church for the Port Authority to acquire the lot that the church had occupied for $20 million; $10 million came from the Port Authority and $10 million from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Under the terms of the deal, the Port Authority would grant land and up to $20 million to help rebuild the church in a new location – in addition, the authority was willing to pay up to $40 million to construct a bomb-proof platform underneath it.
In March 2009, the Port Authority stated that it had stopped talking with the church and had canceled building St. Nicholas altogether. The Port Authority said that the church was asking for too much, and that they might delay the whole World Trade Center project. The Archdiocese, however, said that they just wanted the church back, and a third of the building would be a memorial for 9/11, a place where people of all faiths could pray and remember those who died in the attacks.
In July 2010, George Demos, a former SEC attorney and Republican Congressional candidate, first brought the failure to rebuild St. Nicholas Church into the national debate. Demos said that the executive director of the Port Authority, Chris Ward, had not made rebuilding St. Nicholas church a top priority. On August 16, 2010, Demos launched a petition on his website calling on the Port Authority to rebuild the church, calling the Port Authority "disingenuous and disrespectful". On August 23, 2010, former New York Governor George Pataki joined George Demos at a press conference to call on the Port Authority to reopen talk with officials from the Church.
During the vespers service held on December 5, 2010, Archbishop Demetrios said the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese would do anything to rebuild the church.
On February 14, 2011, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America filed a $20 million lawsuit against the Port Authority pursuant to Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 1983), requesting a grand jury trial for not rebuilding the church.
2011: agreement to rebuild.
As a result of settlement discussions mediated by the Governor of New York's office, the Port Authority and Archdiocese agreed to an independent engineering study to determine the feasibility of siting the Church at various locations in Liberty Park. The four-month study was led by construction expert Peter Lehrer, who worked on the project on a "pro bono" basis with Director of World Trade Center Construction Steven Plate and independent engineers Gorton &amp; Partners and McNamara/Salvia, Inc. The study concluded that structural issues could be resolved to site the Church at 130 Liberty Street at significantly lower cost than originally agreed, and with no delay to construction at the World Trade Center site.
On October 14, 2011, ten years after the church was destroyed, an agreement for the reconstruction of the church was signed that ended all legal action. Governor Andrew Cuomo, Archbishop Demetrios, and Christopher O. Ward, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, announced that the new church would be constructed at the intersection of Liberty and Greenwich Streets in Liberty Park, exactly where it had been envisioned three years before. However, the church would be located on a plot of 4,100 square feet, about two-thirds the size of the site in the earlier proposed plan of 2008. It would also include an adjacent nondenominational bereavement center.
The new site at 130 Liberty Street was less than 50 yards east of the church's original site at 155 Cedar Street, but more than three times larger. The new church would be rebuilt on Port Authority land, on a platform above the helical underground ramp of the Vehicular Security Center, which houses the loading and parking areas of the new World Trade Center. The Port Authority estimated that it would spend about $25 million to construct the platform on which St. Nicholas will sit and provide the necessary utility hookups, while the church would pay for anything built above ground. Archbishop Demetrios stated that "our pledge is to be a witness for all New Yorkers, that freedom of conscience and the fundamental human right of free religious expression will always shine forth in the resurrected St. Nicholas Church."
2014–2017: construction and further fundraising.
Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava was awarded the task of designing the new St. Nicholas; he has referred to the church as a "human-scaled presence in an ensemble of giants." The building takes the form of a circular domed church flanked by four towers, referencing the great Byzantine churches of Hagia Sophia and the Church of the Holy Savior in Chora, both in Istanbul. According to Calatrava, who consulted Archbishop Demetrios with regard to the liturgical and iconographical requirements of the interior, the church would be built of steel and concrete, but the exterior would be clad in stone using a double-wall construction method. The outer wall features thin slabs of Pentelic marble illuminated by LED lights on a nightly basis. While the layout of the interior follows a traditional Greek Orthodox pattern, St. Nicholas functions as an open, pluralistic communal gathering space accessible to the public on a regular basis, in addition to its role as a place of worship.
The ground blessing ceremony and symbolic laying of the cornerstone took place on October 18, 2014, attended by government and church leaders, with construction expected to be completed within two years. In September 2015 a live webcam showing the church's construction was made available.
In 2015, AHEPA chapters from across the country launched fundraising efforts hoping to raise at least $500,000 over the following two years toward the estimated $38 million project, combining contributions with private gifts and donations from the 525 parishes within the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. In the spring of 2016, it was announced that proceeds totaling $100,000 from the liquidation of the assets of St. Nicholas Church in Appleton, Wisconsin would be donated to the rebuilding of St. Nicholas Church and Shrine. The parish would be denoted as a benefactor, and a video history of their church would be present at the new St. Nicholas National Shrine. In September 2016, the Stavros Niarchos Foundation donated 5 million dollars for the rebuilding of Saint Nicholas at the WTC.
On November 29, 2016, the church structure was ceremoniously topped out with a temporary cross, to be replaced with a permanent cross upon completion of the church dome.
On August 21, 2017, the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church signed a formal lease and purchase agreement with the Port Authority for what is to be known as The Saint Nicholas National Shrine at the World Trade Center. The final deal was signed by Rick Cotton, the Port's new executive director, just days after he took on the role. The 198-year lease runs until July 31, 2215, and has an additional 99-year extension, as well as an option to buy the land from the Port Authority at any time during the term of the lease for a nominal [i.e., $1] purchase price.
2017–2021: cessation and resumption of work.
The church was expected to re-open in November 2018. However, in December 2017, Skanska , the construction company rebuilding the Santiago Calatrava-designed shrine, ceased work at the site in Liberty Park. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America had been unable to pay Skanska's bills, despite receiving $37 million in donations for the shrine. According to a December 2017 newsletter, $48,991,760 had been pledged to date, while of that amount $37,398,316 had been collected, leaving a pledge balance of just over $11 million. Following the cessation of work, the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan as well as the state Attorney General's Office opened probes into the project's finances and those of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.
On May 16, 2018, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America released the results of Phase I of a PricewaterhouseCoopers investigative report regarding the rebuilding of Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine (SNCNS). The report concluded that as of December 31, 2017, the Archdiocese owed the SNCNS an aggregate of $3,504,550, excluding interest. On May 2, 2018, the Archdiocese made a $1,000,000 payment to the SNCNS thereby reducing the balance due to $2,504,550.
In July 2018 the Archdiocese closed a deal with Alma Bank for a 10-year, $5.5-million mortgage to restore monies to the unfinished St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine at Liberty Park, however the fresh funding was not expected to be enough to complete the project, whose cost had ballooned to $80 million.
On October 16, 2018, the Special Investigative Committee (SIC) released Phase II of the PricewaterhouseCoopers investigative report to the Archdiocese, along with a summary communication based on the report. It concluded that there was no evidence that St. Nicholas funds were improperly paid to any individuals employed by or associated with the Archdiocese, and no evidence or allegation that fraud was committed in connection with the St. Nicholas project. Rather, the cost overruns appear to have been the result of change orders agreed to by Archdiocese decision-makers to address architectural concerns or enhance the design of SNCNS. In addition, the Special Investigative Committee recommended that the St. Nicholas rebuilding effort be spearheaded by a new legal entity, the "Friends of St. Nicholas," which could be affiliated with, but would be independent from the Archdiocese, with separate bank accounts and an appropriately qualified board to do the fund-raising and oversee the project.
In April 2019, reports from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's office said that he had assembled a team of seven millionaire and billionaire donors committed to putting up the money to complete the project. A keynote address of Archbishop Elpidophoros of America on October 17, 2019, stated that the building of the Church should re-commence immediately with the opening of the doors scheduled by September 11, 2021, the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, as a tribute to those who perished, as well as a lead off to the centenary year of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. New York officials and the Port Authority estimated that the rebuilt church would be the most visited church in the United States.
Fundraising and the resumption of the work was slated to start by January 2020. A nonprofit group formed in January 2020 raised $41.5 million for construction within eight months. However, this work was paused due to a general construction hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. On August 3, 2020, Governor Cuomo and Archbishop Elpidophoros attended a ceremony that was held to officially resume construction. The marble facade was installed in February 2021.
2022: opening.
The St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine was officially consecrated on July 4, 2022. The consecration was celebrated jointly by Archbishop Elpidophoros Lambriniadis, Metropolitan Nicholas Pissare of Detroit, and Metropolitan Savas Zembillas of Pittsburgh. The consecrated altar was signed by all of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese hierarchs who were present, as well as by the two living former Archbishops of America — Spyridon Papageorge and Demetrios Trakatellis, including Protopresbyter Alexander Karloutsos, together with Metropolitan Emmanuel Adamakis of Chalcedon and Metropolitan Prodromos Xenakes of Rethymnon, Crete, who were representing the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The church fully opened for regular services on December 6, 2022, the Feast of Saint Nicholas.
Architecture critic Justin Davidson wrote for "Curbed" that the new church was "a refined pocket project", especially as compared with the much larger World Trade Center Transportation Hub, also designed by Santiago Calatrava. Davidson said, "The dense white nugget of St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church presides over the memorial plaza from a raised platform at the southern end, and it suggests that maybe Calatrava was always a religious architect disguised as a transportation engineer."

Pongamia

Pongamia pinnata is a species of tree in the pea family, Fabaceae, native to eastern and tropical Asia, Australia, and the Pacific islands. It is the sole species in genus Pongamia. It is often known by the synonym "Millettia pinnata". Its common names include Indian beech, Karanja, and Pongame oiltree.
Description.
"Pongamia pinnata" is a legume tree that grows to about in height with a large canopy which spreads equally wide and creates dense shade. It may be deciduous for short periods. It has a straight or crooked trunk, in diameter, with grey-brown bark, which is smooth or vertically fissured. Its wood is white colored. Branches are glabrous with pale stipulate scars. The imparipinnate leaves of the tree alternate and are short-stalked, rounded, or cuneate at the base; ovate or oblong along the length; obtuse-acuminate at the apex; and not toothed on the edges. They are a soft, shiny burgundy when young and mature to a glossy, deep green as the season progresses, with prominent veins underneath.
Flowering generally starts after 3–4 years with small clusters of white, purple, and pink flowers blossoming throughout the year. The raceme-like inflorescences bear two to four flowers that are strongly fragrant and grow to be long. The calyx of the flowers is bell-shaped and truncated, while the corolla is a rounded ovate shape with basal auricles and often with a central blotch of green color.
Croppings of indehiscent pods can occur by 4–6 years. The brown seed pods appear immediately after flowering, and mature in 10 to 11 months. The pods are thick-walled, smooth, somewhat flattened, and elliptical, but slightly curved with a short, curved point. The pods contain within them one or two bean-like brownish-red seeds, but because they do not split open naturally, the pods need to decompose before the seeds can germinate. The seeds are about long with a brittle, oily coat, and are unpalatable in natural form to herbivores.
"Pongamia pinnata" is an outbreeding diploid legume tree, with a diploid chromosome number of 22. Root nodules are of the determinate type (as those on soybean and common bean) formed by the causative bacterium "Bradyrhizobium".
Taxonomy.
The species was first described as "Cytisus pinnatus" by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. In 1898, Jean Baptiste Louis Pierre reclassified it as "Pongamia pinnata". In 1984, Robert Geesink concluded that species of "Pongamia" and "Millettia" were easily confused, and consolidated the "Pongamia" species into "Millettia". Subsequent studies revealed that "Millettia pinnata" was paraphyletic within "Millettia", and the species was reclassified as "Pongamia pinnata", the sole species in the revived genus "Pongamia".
Distribution and habitat.
The species is naturally distributed in tropical and temperate Asia, from India to Japan to Thailand to Malesia to north and northeastern Australia to some Pacific islands; It has been propagated and distributed further around the world in humid and subtropical environments from sea level to 1,360 m (Chingola, Zambia), although in the Himalayan foothills, it is not found above 600 m. Withstanding temperatures slightly below and up to about and annual rainfall of , the tree grows wild on sandy and rocky soils, including oolitic limestone, and will grow in most soil types, even with its roots in salt water.
The tree is well suited to intense heat and sunlight, and its dense network of lateral roots and its thick, long taproot make it drought tolerant. The dense shade it provides slows the evaporation of surface water and its root nodules promote nitrogen fixation, a symbiotic process by which gaseous nitrogen (N2) from the air is converted into ammonium (NH4+, a form of nitrogen available to the plant). "M. pinnata "is also a freshwater flooded forest species, as it can survive total submergence in water for few months continuously. "M. pinnata" trees are common in Tonlesap lake swamp forests in Cambodia.
"P. pinnata" is now broadly distributed across India, Asia, Africa, northern Australia, and the Pacific and Caribbean Islands and it has been cultivated and transported since the nineteenth century or earlier. As a result, some literature declares "M. pinnata" naturalized in Africa and certain parts of the United States, while its status as naturalized or native is uncertain in other regions.
Uses.
"Pongamia pinnata" is well-adapted to arid zones, and has many traditional uses. It is often used for landscaping as a windbreak or for shade due to the large canopy and showy, fragrant flowers. The flowers are used by gardeners as compost for plants. The bark may be used to make twine or rope, and it also yields a black gum that has historically been used to treat wounds caused by poisonous fish. The wood is said to be beautifully grained, but splits easily when sawn, thus relegating it to firewood, posts, and tool handles. The tree's deep taproot and drought tolerance makes this tree ideal for controlling soil erosion and binding sand dunes.
"Pongamia pinnata" seeds generally contain oil (27-39%), protein (17-37%), starch (6-7%), crude fiber (5-7%), moisture (15-20%), and ash content (2-3%). Nearly half of the oil content of "P. pinnata" seeds is oleic acid. Oil made from the seeds, known as pongamia oil, has been used as lamp oil, in soapmaking, and as a lubricant. The oil has a high content of triglycerides. Its disagreeable taste and odor are due to bitter flavonoid constituents, including karanjin, pongamol, tannin, and karanjachromene. These compounds induce nausea and vomiting if ingested in its natural form. The fruits, sprouts and seeds are used in traditional medicine. Some studies have identified hiragonic acid in "Pongamia pinnata" seed oil.
It can be grown in rainwater harvesting ponds up to in water depth without losing its greenery and remaining useful for biodiesel production. Studies have shown seedlings with tolerance to salinity levels between 12 and 19 dS/m, with an ability to tolerate salinity stresses of 32.5 dS/m.
The seed oil has been found to be useful in diesel generators, and along with "Jatropha" and castor, it is being explored in hundreds of projects throughout India and the third world as feedstock for biodiesel. "P. pinnata" as a biofuel is commercially valuable to the rural populations of places such as India and Bangladesh, where the plant grows abundantly, because it can support the socioeconomic development of these areas.
Several unelectrified villages have used pongamia oil, simple processing techniques, and diesel generators to create their own grid systems to run water pumps and electric lighting.
Research indicates potential use of "P. pinnata" as a food source for cattle, sheep, and poultry, as its byproduct contains up to 30% protein. As adaptive uses are increasing, the tree is being planted in former citrus growing regions that have declined in Florida and California because of disease and climate change conditions.

The village of Kut Chum was established in 1912. A minor district ("king amphoe"), Kut Chum was established on 1 August 1961. It was composed of the four sub-districts: Non Pueai, Phai (in 1978 reassigned to Sai Mun District), Phon Ngan, and Kammaet, all split off from Mueang Yasothon district.
On 17 July 1963, it was elevated to the level of district ("amphoe"), then of Ubon Ratchathani province. When Yasothon was separated from Ubon, Kut Chum was one of the districts assigned to the new province.
Geography.
Neighboring districts are (from the northeast clockwise): Loeng Nok Tha, Thai Charoen, Pa Tio, Mueang Yasothon, and Sai Mun of Yasothon Province, and Selaphum and Nong Phok of Roi Et province.
Economy.
Kut Chum is known for its organic movement and organic foods, chiefly the organic farming of rice. Kut Chum is also known for issuing its own local scrip called "Bia Kut Chum". Bia, Thai for 'cowry shell', was once a unit of currency equal to of a Thai baht, and "bia" is used in metaphorical expressions, so the usage ran afoul of currency laws. To side-step implications that they intended a substitute local currency, they changed to "Boon Kut Chum", which are barter coupons with a fixed value in baht, that may be exchanged for goods and services in the community.
Administration.
The district is divided into nine sub-districts ("tambons") and 125 villages ("mubans").
Local administration.
Kut Chum Phatthana is a sub-district municipality ("thesaban tambon") which covers parts of sub-districts Kut Chum and Non Pueai. There are a further nine tambon administrative organizations (TAO), one for each sub-district covering the non-municipal areas.

Donald D. Chamberlin

Donald D. Chamberlin is an American computer scientist who is one of the principal designers of the original SQL language specification with Raymond Boyce. He also made significant contributions to the development of XQuery.
Chamberlin was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1997 for contributions to the SQL database query language.
Biography.
Donald D. Chamberlin was born in San Jose, California. After attending Campbell High School, he studied engineering at Harvey Mudd College from where he holds a BS. After graduating, he went to Stanford University on a National Science Foundation grant. At Stanford, he studied electrical engineering and minored in computer science. Chamberlin holds an MSc and a PhD degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University. After graduating, Chamberlin went to work for IBM Research at the Yorktown Heights research facility in New York, where he had previously had a summer internship.
Chamberlin is best known as co-inventor of SQL (Structured Query Language), the world's most widely used database language. Developed in the mid-1970s by Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce, SQL was the first commercially successful language for relational databases. Chamberlin also was one of the managers of IBM System R, which produced the first SQL implementation and developed much of IBM's relational database technology. System R, together with the Ingres project at U.C. Berkeley, received the ACM Software System Award in 1988.
Until his retirement in 2009, he was based at the Almaden Research Center. He was appointed an IBM Fellow in 2003.
In 2000, jointly with Jonathan Robie and Daniela Florescu, he drafted a proposal for an XML query language called Quilt. Many ideas from this proposal found their way into the XQuery language specification, which was developed by W3C with Chamberlin as an editor. XQuery became a W3C Recommendation in January 2007.
Chamberlin is also an ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. In 2005, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Zurich.
In 2009, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum "for his fundamental work on structured query language (SQL) and database architectures."

Queens of the Circulating Library

Queens of the Circulating Library is a 2000 album by the British experimental group Coil. It is unusual in the sense that it is perhaps the only release without participation from Peter Christopherson. On this album, Coil were: "Thighpaulsandra &amp; John Balance with Dorothy Lewis as the queen of the circulating library. Thanks to Simon Norris." The lyrics were written by John Balance and spoken by Dorothy Lewis, Thighpaulsandra's mother. The line "It's in the trees, it's coming" that appears in the lyrics is from the 1957 British horror film "Night of the Demon", and had previously appeared in sampled form in the song "Hounds of Love" by Kate Bush.
The album was initially released on the date of the Coil Presents Time Machines concert. The original packaging was clear, however a wider issue of the album used pink, c-shell CD cases. No album art was included for this release.
In 2022, Dais Records remastered and reissued the album on vinyl record (in six different colorways, with some having lenticular covers), CD and Bandcamp download. The remaster was done by Josh Bonati, while official cover art was created by Nathaniel Young.

Xiao Tong

Xiao Tong (, October 501 – 7 May 531), courtesy name Deshi (), formally Crown Prince Zhaoming (昭明太子, literally "Accomplished and Understanding Crown Prince"), was a crown prince of the Chinese Liang dynasty, posthumously honored as Emperor Zhaoming (). He was the oldest son and heir apparent of Emperor Wu of Liang, whom he predeceased. Xiao Tong's enduring legacy is the literary compendium "Wen Xuan" ("Selections of Refined Literature").
Birth and childhood.
Xiao Tong was born to Xiao Yan, then a Southern Qi general nearing final victory in a civil war against the cruel and violent emperor Xiao Baojuan, in winter 501. He was born at Xiao Yan's power base of Xiangyang, to Xiao Yan's concubine Ding Lingguang (). (Xiao Yan's wife Chi Hui () had died in 499, and from that point on he had only concubines and never made any of them his wife.) After Xiao Yan's victory later in 501, he forced Emperor He of Southern Qi, whom he had supported as a rival claimant to the Southern Qi throne, to yield the throne to him in 502, ending Southern Qi and starting Liang Dynasty (as its Emperor Wu). The officials requested that he make Xiao Tong, then an infant, the crown prince. While Emperor Wu initially declined on account that the empire had not been pacified, he did so on 24 December 502, when Xiao Tong was only one year old. After Xiao Tong was created crown prince, his mother Consort Ding, while not made empress, was given a special status co-equal with her son.
Xiao Tong was said to be intelligent, kind, and obedient to his parents from his childhood. As per customs of the time, in 506, he was housed in the Yongfu Mansion (), the residence for the crown prince, in his childhood, but he missed his parents, and so every few days or so Emperor Wu would spend several days at Yongfu Mansion. (Whether Consort Ding did the same is not recorded in history.) 
On 17 May 508, he was wedded to his main wife Lady Cai.
On 31 January 515, he went through his rite of passage and was declared an adult, and Emperor Wu bestowed him a crown.
As adult.
As Emperor Wu was an avid Buddhist, Xiao Tong also became one, and he studied sutras intently, often inviting Buddhist monks to his palace to preach and to discuss Buddhist doctrines. After his rite of passage, Emperor Wu also began to gradually have him handle more and more matters of state, becoming less involved in the day-to-day operations of the empire.
On 9 December 522, Xiao Tong's uncle Xiao Dan () the Prince of Shixing died. By custom, a crown prince would not hold a mourning period for an uncle, but Xiao Tong believed this custom to be unfilial, and therefore requested the officials to further discuss the matter. After the official Liu Xiaochuo () suggested that he hold a one-month mourning period, he agreed, and in fact made this a precedent for the Liang Dynasty.
During this period, Xiao Tong and others compiled a compendium of ancient poetry and texts, which he referred to as "Wenxuan" (文選, "Selections of Refined Literature"), which was later known after his death as the "Zhaoming Wenxuan" (, "Zhaoming" being his posthumous name). It is a work of historical importance, as it preserved many ancient texts which otherwise might have been lost.
In late 526, Consort Ding grew ill, and Xiao Tong spent his days attending to her without rest. She died on 3 January 527, and Xiao Tong was so saddened that he ate nothing. It was after Emperor Wu tried to console him by pointing out that he should not harm his body and that he still had his father that Xiao Tong began to take porridge, but he ate nothing further. He was described to be fairly obese until that point, but he lost a lot of weight during the mourning period for Consort Ding.
Death.
The death of Consort Ding brought about a disastrous effect in Xiao Tong's relationship with his father, however. Xiao Tong sought out an appropriate place to bury Consort Ding, but while he was doing so, a landowner bribed the eunuch Yu Sanfu () into convincing Emperor Wu that that piece of land would bring good fortune for the emperor, and so Emperor Wu bought the land and buried Consort Ding there. However, once Consort Ding was buried, a Taoist monk informed Xiao Tong that he believed that the land would bring ill fortune for Consort Ding's oldest son—Xiao Tong. Xiao Tong therefore allowed the monk to bury a few items intended to dissolve and defuse the ill fortune, such as wax geese, at the position reserved for the oldest son. Later on, when one of Xiao Tong's attendants, Bao Miaozhi (), was squeezed out of Xiao Tong's inner circles by another attendant, Wei Ya (), he, in resentment, reported to Emperor Wu that Wei had carried out sorcery on Xiao Tong's behalf. When Emperor Wu investigated, waxed geese were found, and Emperor Wu became surprised and angry, and wanted to investigate further. He only stopped the investigation when he was advised to do so by the prime minister Xu Mian, executing only the Taoist monk who had suggested the burial of wax gooses. Xiao Tong was humiliated in the affair, and was never able to clear himself completely in his father's eyes.
Xiao Tong died in May 531. Even when he was very ill, because he was afraid to make Emperor Wu be concerned about him, he still personally wrote submissions to his father. After his death, Emperor Wu personally attended his wake and buried him at a tomb appropriate for an emperor. He also summoned Xiao Tong's oldest son, Xiao Huan () the Duke of Huarong back to the capital Jiankang, preparing to create Xiao Huan crown prince to replace his father. However, still resentful over the wax geese affair, he hesitated for days without carrying out the creation, and finally did not do so. Instead, against popular opinion, he created Xiao Tong's younger brother, also by Consort Ding, Xiao Gang crown prince. In 551, when Xiao Gang, then emperor (as Emperor Jianwen) but under control and virtual house arrest by the revolting general Hou Jing, Hou, to try to show off his power, deposed Emperor Jianwen and made Xiao Tong's grandson Xiao Dong the Prince of Yuzhang emperor. It was then that Xiao Tong was posthumously honored an emperor.
Literary legacy.
Xiao Tong is survived by his great literary compendium, the "Wenxuan", an anthology of literature divided into 60 chapters. Chapter 29 preserves the "Nineteen Old Poems", a major source for early Classical Chinese poetry. Xiao appears to consider these to be anonymous works, a view supported by modern scholarship, despite the claims of Xu Ling in his "New Songs from the Jade Terrace".

James Wordie

 
Sir James Mann Wordie (26 April 1889 – 16 January 1962) was a Scottish polar explorer and geologist. Friends knew him as Jock Wordie.
He was President of the Royal Geographical Society from 1951 to 1954.
Early life and education.
Wordie was born at Partick, Glasgow, the son of Jane Catherine ( Mann) and John Wordie, owner of Wordie &amp; Co., a major carrier and carting contractor, with multiple premises throughout Glasgow. He had a sister, Helen. The family lived at 4 Buckingham Terrace in the Hillhead district. The house, which still stands, is a mid-terraced 19th-century three-storey and basement house facing Great Western Road.
Wordie attended Glasgow Academy. He went on to study Sciences at the University of Glasgow, graduating with a BSc in Geology in 1910. He then studied at St John's College, Cambridge, graduating with an MA in 1912, after which he undertook research. His occupation brought him in contact with Frank Debenham and Raymond Priestley, who were members of the second Antarctic expedition of Robert Falcon Scott.
Polar exploration.
In 1914, Wordie joined Sir Ernest Shackleton's expedition to the Antarctic, known as the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, where he acted as geologist and chief of scientific staff. Despite the overall failure of the expedition—including the beset ship "Endurance", caught up in the Weddell Sea until destroyed by ice in 1915—Wordie maintained the morale of the expedition, made scientific observations regarding oceanography and the ice pack, and acquired important geological specimens.
On his return to the UK, he was conscripted into the army and served during World War I with the Royal Artillery in France from 1917 to 1918. He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Back Award in 1920.
In 1921 he was among a team of climbers who successfully climbed the Beerenberg stratovolcano on Jan Mayen island for the first time.
Wordie sailed on nine polar expeditions, including Endurance. During the 1920s and 1930s, he made numerous voyages to the Arctic and helped nurture a new generation of young explorers, including Vivian Fuchs, Gino Watkins and Augustine Courtauld. Other scientific staff included the meteorologist Edmund Dymond on his 1937 research trip to Baffin Bay. He became the elder statesman of British polar exploration, and few expeditions left Britain without first consulting Wordie. The Wordie Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula was named in his honour.
In World War II he served with Naval Intelligence.
He was chairman of the Committee of Management of the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) and president of the Royal Geographical Society from 1951 to 1954. 
During his term at the Society he helped plan the first successful ascent of Mount Everest by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. While at SPRI, he assisted Fuchs in the first crossing of the Antarctic continent—the original aim of Shackleton's Endurance expedition. He also contributed to the British "Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series" that was published during World War II.
Final years.
Both the University of Glasgow and University of Hull awarded him honorary doctorates (LLD). In 1954, he was elected an honorary fellow of Trinity College Dublin.
He died at Grange Court, Grange Road in Cambridge on 16 January 1962. His ashes were scattered at his family memorial in the churchyard of the Church of the Holy Rude in Stirling, Scotland.
Marriage.
In 1923, he married Gertrude Henderson.
Recognition.
Wordie was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1922. His proposers were Frederick Orpen Bower, Andrew Gray, James Gordon Gray and James Currie.
He was awarded the first W. S. Bruce Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 1926, the Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1933 and the Scottish Geographical Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 1944. He was made Master of St John's College, Cambridge and in 1957 was knighted for his contributions to polar expeditions.
The Wordiekammen Limestone and Wordie Creek Formation were named in his honour. Places named after him include Mount Wordie, Wordie Point, Wordie Bay, Wordie Bay (Greenland), Wordie Seamount, Wordie Ice Shelf, Wordie Glacier, Wordie Nunatak and Point Wordie.
In popular culture.
Wordie was portrayed by Jamie Lee in the 2002 television miniseries "Shackleton".

ENTH domain

The epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain is a structural domain that is found in proteins involved in endocytosis and cytoskeletal machinery.
Structure.
This domain is approximately 150 amino acids in length and is always found located at the N-termini of proteins. The domain forms a compact globular structure, composed of nine alpha-helices connected by loops of
varying length. The general topology is determined by three helical hairpins that are stacked consecutively with a right hand twist. An N-terminal helix folds back, forming a deep basic groove that forms the binding pocket for the Ins(1,4,5)P3 ligand. The lipid ligand is coordinated by residues from surrounding alpha-helices and all three phosphates are multiply coordinated.
Interactions with the lipid bilayer.
Proteins containing this domain have been found to bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 and Ins(1,4,5)P3 suggesting that the domain is a membrane-interacting module. The main function of proteins containing this domain appears to be to act as accessory clathrin adaptors in endocytosis, epsin is able to recruit and promote clathrin polymerisation on a lipid monolayer, but may have additional roles in signalling and actin regulation. Epsin causes a strong degree of membrane curvature and tubulation, even fragmentation of membranes with a high PtdIns(4,5)P2 content. Epsin binding to membranes facilitates their deformation by insertion of the N-terminal helix into the inner leaflet of the bilayer, pushing the head groups apart. This would reduce the energy needed to curve the membrane into a vesicle, making it easier for the clathrin cage to fix and stabilise the curved membrane. This points to a pioneering role for epsin in vesicle budding, as it provides both a driving force and a link between membrane invagination and clathrin polymerisation.
In particular, epsin-1 shows specificity for the membrane glycophospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, however not all ENTH domains bind to this molecule. Binding causes tubulation of liposomes and "in vivo" this membrane-binding function is normally coordinated with clathrin polymerisation.
The N-terminal alpha-helix of this domain is hydrophobic and inserts into the membrane like a wedge and helps to drive membrane curvature.

Herräng Dance Camp

Herräng Dance Camp (commonly abbreviated HDC, officially Herräng Dance Camp Aktiebolag) is the largest annual dance camp that focuses on lindy hop, boogie woogie, tap dance, jazz dance, and balboa. It is held annually in July in Herräng, Sweden, and focuses both on instruction and dancing.
Swing era dancers that have presented at the camp include Al Minns, Frankie Manning, Norma Miller, Chazz Young, and Dawn Hampton.
While the camp is occurring, infrastructure is added to the village to accommodate the dancers. This includes several cafes; a full cafeteria serving buffet-style meals; a shop for dance supplies, accessories and daily essentials; bicycle rental; housing of various standards; and nightly entertainment.
History.
The first Herräng Dance Camp was held for one week, starting on 1 August 1982, and was organized by the Swedish Swing Society, a swing dance organization based in Stockholm, Sweden. It was attended by around 25 participants and was entirely taught by John Clancy from New York. Attendance increased to nearly 100 students in its second year. For the following five years, the camp grew in popularity in and around Sweden, and was only attended by Swedish dancers. It eventually gained an international following. Frankie Manning attended the camp for the first time in 1989.

Bernetta Adams Miller

Bernetta Adams Miller (January 11, 1884 – November 30, 1972) was a pioneering woman aviator who was the fifth licensed woman pilot in the United States. She led a colorful life including winning a Croix de Guerre in World War I and being one of the people standing between Albert Einstein and the public at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.
Early life.
Bernetta Miller was born in Canton, Ohio. Her family lived for a time in Nebraska, but soon moved to the Finger Lakes region of New York state where she briefly attended the State Normal School at Geneseo. She dropped out when her father's business failed, and they returned to Canton, where she attended Canton Actual Business College where she studied bookkeeping. She then moved to New York City.
Aviation.
In New York, she became interested in aviation and took flying lessons in 1912 from the Moisant aviation school in Mineola, Long Island. Miller's apprenticeship was on the Hempstead Plains aviation field. She received her license on September 16, 1912, becoming the fifth woman in the U.S. to hold a pilot's license (she held Aero Club of America license number 173). During her flight tests by moonlight, the New York Times reportedCritics here regard her license fly as remarkable. The trial called for an altitude of only 150 feet, and she rose to 600. In the landing test, she was expected to touch the ground within 164 feet of a designated object, and she made the spot within 20 feet.The Moisant company used her as a demonstration pilot for the Blériot monoplanes that they were building under license. She was the pilot chosen to demonstrate the Moisant-Blériot monoplane to the United States Army at College Park, Maryland on October 7, 1912. She wrote of it, much later
This was apparently the first demonstration of a monoplane to the U.S. government. In a special edition, the New York Times reported on Miller's insistence on flying despite the recent death of two military aviators, Lt. Rockwell and Cpl. Scott, at College Park. On September 29, 1912, the newspaper quoted her as sayingI am not here to do fancy flying, but simply to show the people of Washington that the monoplane is a better machine than the biplane. I will not fly until after the funeral of the two men who were killed. I think it would be disrespectful. My ambition is to become a great cross-country flier. I am not flying to achieve fame as a fancy flier or an exhibition flier, but to show women that the aeroplane is practical when it is asked to do only what it is physically possible to do.On January 20, 1913 at Garden City, New York she attempted a women's altitude record, but had to return to ground when an oil gauge broke and oil obscured her vision. With increasing disapproval of women flying after the death of Harriet Quimby, and suffering financial difficulties, she gave up aviation soon after.
World War I.
Bernetta went to the front in World War I as a volunteer for the YMCA. She delivered food to the troops of the 326th Infantry of the 82nd Division as a canteen worker, frequently under fire. She was wounded at least once, but remained at the front through the Argonne offensive and to the end of the war. In 1919 she was awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French government. Her commendation read
Assigned to Tours at the beginning of 1918 and then sent to the Toul sector in June 1918, she rendered the biggest services before and during the offensive of Saint-Mihiel, serving and helping the injured in the advanced aid stations. She was in the sector of the Argonne during this last offensive.
In a letter of commendation from the command of the 82nd Division on 13 January 1919 it was said that
While operating her canteen near the front line, at Noviant, France, on the night of August 4, 1918, Miss Miller was under heavy enemy fire, where she served hot chocolate and other supplies to the men, when it was impossible for these supplies to be obtained elsewhere. On October 17, 1918, during an attack near St. Juvin, France, under enemy fire, she visited the front lines, carrying a supply of cigarettes and other comforts to the men. By her devotion to duty, disregard of personal danger and untiring energy she did much to maintain a cheerful spirit among the soldiers during a critical time.
Turkey and after.
From 1926 to 1933 Bernetta was Bursar of the American College for Girls in Istanbul, Turkey. She resigned that job when a new head of school was appointed whom she disliked, and she returned to the United States. From 1933 to 1941 she was Bursar of St. Mary's Hall, a private school in Burlington, New Jersey.
The Institute for Advanced Study.
From 1941 to 1948 she worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. She was at first secretary to the director of the Institute and bookkeeper, but when her vision declined owing to cataracts she was made a greeter in the entrance of the Institute. As such, she was one of the people responsible for keeping visitors from disturbing Albert Einstein. After Robert Oppenheimer became head of the Institute, he fired Bernetta. She said of him "I think the man was a complete snake -- but I would "never" say that he was disloyal."
Her view of Einstein was entirely different. She referred to him as "the dear" and in a 1963 interview said of him:
Of all the men there he was one of the kindest. He loved everybody. He was the nicest, most out-going man. There was nothing petty about him. We all protected him and tried to screen his calls and visitors.
 When she was fired Einstein wrote a letter of reference for her.
Later years.
After Princeton, Bernetta worked as a housemother in colleges. She was admitted to membership in the Early Birds, an association of aviators who had flown before 1917. She retired to New Hope, Pennsylvania where she died, after breaking her hip in a fall, in November 1972. She is buried in West Lawn Cemetery in Canton, Ohio. Bernetta was a member of the Women's Overseas Service League.
Museum collections.
Her 1912 flying suit (actually one made for riding in open automobiles) is on display at the College Park Airport in Maryland. There is a picture of her in the Early Flight room of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.
Her pilot's license and Early Bird plaque are in the collection of the Stark County Historical Society, dba McKinley Presidential Library &amp; Museum, in her hometown of Canton, Ohio.

Walter Lloyd "Kit" Carson (November 15, 1912 – June 21, 1983) was a Major League Baseball right fielder who played for the Cleveland Indians in 1934 and 1935. As a 21-year-old rookie in 1934, he was the ninth-youngest player to appear in an American League game that season.
Carson, a native of Colton, California, made his major league debut on July 21, 1934 in a home game against the Boston Red Sox. His last appearance for the Indians was September 29, 1935 in a home game against the St. Louis Browns. He played in a total of 21 games, eight of which were in right field. At the plate he went 10-for-40 (.250) with two runs batted in, five runs scored, and a slugging percentage of .400. In the field he recorded nine putouts without making an error.
In later years, Carson was employed by the Long Beach (California) City College Athletic Department and also managed the Long Beach Rockets amateur baseball team.

Box pew

A box pew is a type of church pew that is encased in panelling and was prevalent in England and other Protestant countries from the 16th to early 19th centuries.
History in England.
Before the rise of Protestantism, seating was not customary in churches and only accorded to the lord of the manor, civic dignitaries and finally churchwardens. After 1569 stools and seating were installed in Protestant churches primarily because the congregation were expected to listen to sermons, and various types of seating were introduced including the box pew. There are records of box pews being installed in Ludlow parish church before 1577. Box pews provided privacy and allowed the family to sit together. In the 17th century they could include windows, curtains, tables and even fireplaces, and were treated as personal property that could be willed to legatees. Sometimes the panelling was so high it was difficult to see out, and the privacy was used as a cover for non-devotional activity. William Hogarth satirized the trend in his paintings and sketches. By the eighteenth century it became normal to install formal box pews instead of random personal constructions. This provided a more classic line to the church, although Sir Christopher Wren objected to pews in his churches. With the mid-19th century church reforms, box pews were generally swept away and replaced by bench pews. However a number of examples still remain in various churches throughout the United Kingdom.
New England.
In colonial New England, it was common for the colonial meeting house to have box pews. Families would typically sit together in a box pew, and it is theorized that the concept of the box pew resulted from the fact that the early meeting houses were not heated, and the walls of the box pews would minimize drafts, thus keeping the occupants relatively warmer in the winter. It was common for families to bring foot warmers (wooden boxes filled with hot stones gathered from the home or local tavern hearth) and crickets (foot stools) and blankets to meeting, huddling together with their feet held above the foot warmer on a cricket, using the blankets as a tent over their shoulders down to their feet. Another advantage to the box pew was that family elders would sit facing the pulpit while children sat facing the elders and with their backs towards the pulpit. Thus elders could keep an eye on the minister in the pulpit while also keeping an eye on their children.

Jones Intercable

Jones Intercable was a cable television company founded by Glenn R. Jones in 1970. Jones, already a cable television veteran, had bought his first cable system in Georgetown, Colorado after taking a $400 loan on his Volkswagen. The company expanded rapidly and by 1994 it had 1.4 million subscribers. In 1995, the company was 30 percent owned by Bell Canada International.
In 1999, Comcast took full control of Jones Intercable, acquiring 100 percent of the company in a deal valued around $3 billion.
History.
1970–1990.
The company was founded in cable television by Glenn R. Jones in 1970. Jones, already a cable television veteran, had bought his first cable system in Georgetown, Colorado after taking a $400 loan on his Volkswagen. In 1986, the ownership of Jones Intercable of Tampa, which had formerly been Tampa Cable, was transferred to a company called Cable TV Fund 12-BCD Venture. In 1988, Jones Intercable purchased Broward Cablevision for $95 million, which was providing service in Broward County, Florida. In 1989, the cable television operations TCI East and Adelphia Cable Communications were trying to buy Jones Intercable's business in New York. Jones Intercable was being sold because "the limited partnership that has owned it for more than five years is dissolving so investors may cash out."
1991–1997.
The company served "40,000 customers in nine communities, most of them in western Du Page County" in early 1992. In 1993, 30% of the company was purchased by BCI Telecom Holdings, which maintained partial ownership of the cable firm until May 1998, when Comcast announced it would be buying BCI's 37% portion of the cable giant. The company expanded rapidly and by 1994 it had 1.4 million subscribers. It was also broadcasting in Antelope Valley, California in 1993 and in Georgia in 1995, when it had around 77,500 or so subscribers overall, with 55 cable systems and 1.5 million "basic" subscribers. In 1995, the company was 30 percent owned by Bell Canada International.
Jones Intercable in September in 1995 launched a $35 million cable television system in Alexandria. The "Baltimore Sun" called it an "important milestone" as seen by video industry experts, as the new design had a "self-healing" function to eliminate cable outages, also expanding from 53 analog channels to 87. Between 1994 and 1996, Jones spent $40 million on equipment in Alexandria, and in 1996 was giving cable service to 39,000 out of 62,000 households and businesses in the city. Around two dozen residents in Alexandria were used to test a new service, described as "ultra-high-speed access to the Internet through cable TV wires" by "The Washington Post", in 1995 and 1996, expanding on the company's already existent cable TV franchise in Alexandria. The system removed the need to dial out, as the service was always on.
1998–1999.
A deal in May 1998 to purchase some stock gave Comcast "rights to acquire control of Jones Intercable's 1.4 million subscribers and prevents anyone else from getting them." The Comcast deal left Comcast with a 37 percent economic stake and a 47 percent voting stake.
Around September 1999, Comcast announced that it had started to buy up the company's stock. Comcast purchased almost a million Class-A shares of Jones Intercable from Jones International along with almost 3,000 from Glenn Jones himself. This led to Comcast taking full control of Jones Intercable, with Comcast acquiring 100 percent of the company in a deal valued at around $3 billion.

Florus of Lyon

Florus of Lyon (), a deacon in Lyon, was an ecclesiastical writer in the first half of the ninth century. A theologian, canonist, liturgist, and poet, he ran the scriptorium at Lyons. He was considered one of the foremost authorities on theological questions among the clergy of the Frankish kingdom. He died about 860. 
Life.
There is no information regarding the place of birth, the parents, or the youth of this distinguished theologian; but it is probable that he came from the neighbourhood of Lyons. He is mentioned in a letter by the Benedictine monk Walafrid Strabo, indicating that his writings were known beyond Lyons to southern Germany. From the fact that by about 827 he already enjoyed a reputation as a theologian, it may be concluded that he was born certainly before the end of the eighth century.
He was a deacon of the church of Lyons, which office he continued to hold throughout his life. He had some acquaintance with Greek, which was rare in his time, and a little Hebrew. He was head of the cathedral school at Lyon, on which account he is commonly called "Florus Magister".
Florus directed the Lyons scriptorium in which he produced editions of many texts. The transmission of some ancient texts is due to Florus: especially the Latin version (the only complete) of Irenæus' Adversus Hæreses and excerpts from the lost work "Contra Fabianum" of Fulgentius of Ruspe. As one of the most brilliant spirits of his time, Florus composed impressive compilations of the Church Fathers on defined subjects (Paul's epistles). He was considered one of the foremost authorities on theological questions among the clergy of the Frankish kingdom; and, in consequence, his opinion was often sought in important ecclesiastical matters.
Florus was also much involved in contemporary debates. He was a partisan of Archbishop Agobard of Lyon, who was deposed in 835 for his support of the rebellion against Emperor Louis the Pious, and replaced by Amalarius. In Agobard's defence, Florus wrote a short treatise on how bishops should be appointed; he also attacked Amalarius on theological grounds, accusing him of heretical interpretation of the liturgy. Amalarius was deposed and accused of heresy in 838. When he returned to Lyon, Agobard worked to roll back Amalarius' actions, with the support of Florus.
Florus also used his remarkable knowledge of Augustine to contribute to the Predestination debates of the mid ninth century, in which he defended Gottschalk of Orbais. In the course of these debates, Florus was able to show the inauthenticity of several Pseudo-Augustinian texts.
Almost forgotten for a thousand years, Florus was rediscovered thanks in part to the works of Célestin Charlier in the mid-twentieth century. Subsequent studies are beginning to provide the first critical editions of his works.

Hayes (surname)

Hayes is an English language surname. In the United States Census, 1990, Hayes was the 100th most common surname recorded. The oldest record of the surname dates to 1197 in the "Eynsham Cartulary of Oxfordshire", where it appears in the form "Heise". There are nineteen coats of arms assumed by or granted to individuals with this or a similar surname. Though primarily a surname, "Hayes" sometimes appears as a given name in census records.
Origin.
Derived from name of Irish god.
In Ireland, Hayes originated as a Gaelic polygenetic surname "O hAodha", meaning descendant of Aodh ("fire"), or of Aed, an Irish mythological god. Septs in most counties anglicised "O hAodha" to "Hayes". In County Cork, it became "O'Hea". In the province of Ulster, it became "Hughes", the patronymic of Hugh, an anglicized variant of the given name Aodh. Hayes is noted on a public record in County Wexford as early as 1182. In County Cork, under the Munster providence, Hayes falls under the banner of the McNamara clan in the Dalcassian Sept. Other Irish Hayeses have also been associated with Clan Cian, the ruling O'Carroll clan of southern Ireland.
Derived from place-name element.
England.
In England, "Hayes" arose as a locational surname, associated with one of the several places named or suffixed "-Hay, -Hays, -Hayes", etc., such as those in Kent, or Middlesex. Such place names had two origins, one based on the Old English "haes" (brushwood, underwood) and the other based on "horg" (enclosure) or "hege" (hedge). The distribution of "Hayes" in Great Britain in 1881 and 1998 is similar, and restricted to areas of England well separated from Scotland and showing some penetration into Wales. This surname has gained in popularity in the century between 1881 and 1998, but remains at a rank below 150 and a frequency lower than that in the United States and some other countries of the Commonwealth.
Scotland.
In Scotland, Hayes is a Scoto-Norman surname, a direct translation of the Normans' locational surname "de la Haye", meaning "of La Haye", La Haye ("the hedge") being the name of several towns on the Cotentin peninsula of Normandy, France. The first Norman namebearer to arrive in Scotland was William II de la Haye in the time of the Norman invasion. Clan Hay descends from him.
Other.
Hayes also can derive from the Yiddish name Khaye, meaning "life".
Notable people with the surname.
Listed here are people who share the "Hayes" surname, organized by birth year, to assist in assembling a view of the geographic distribution of this surname over time.
Distribution.
As a surname, Hayes is the 191st most common surname in Great Britain, with 42,475 bearers. It is most common in Kent, where it is the 73rd most common surname, with 4,828 bearers. Other concentrations include, Buckinghamshire, (34th,3,304), Caerphilly, (43rd,1,700), Carmarthenshire, (48th,1,696), Merseyside, (79th,3,252), Swansea, (86th,1,704), City of Leeds (165th,1,722), Lancashire, (177th,3,370), Greater London, (288th,3,358), Greater Manchester, (335th,1,724), Cheshire, (386th,1,678), Essex, (618th,1,666), and Scotland.

Rose City Park, Portland, Oregon

Rose City Park is a neighborhood (and a park of the same name) in Northeast Portland, Oregon. It borders Beaumont-Wilshire, Grant Park, and the Hollywood District on the west (at NE 47th Avenue), Cully on the north (at NE Fremont Street), Roseway and Madison South on the east (at NE 65th Avenue), and Center on the south (at the Banfield Expressway and MAX transit line).
The neighborhood was platted in 1907, the year of the first Portland Rose Festival. Trolley service from Downtown Portland was inaugurated that year by the Portland Railway, Light &amp; Power Co., and discontinued November 30, 1936.
In addition to its eponymous park (acquired 1920), other parks in the neighborhood include Normandale Park (1940), Frazer Park (1950, on the site of a former juvenile detention center), and the western part of Rose City Golf Course (1920), whose clubhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. A statue of George Washington was commissioned by Henry Waldo Coe and sculpted by Pompeo Coppini, and dedicated on July 4, 1927. It stood at 57th Avenue and Sandy Boulevard, in the center of the neighborhood, until it was toppled and burned by rioters on June 18, 2020, in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
Beginning in March 1946, NABISCO proposed building a large factory on in the Rose City Park neighborhood, choosing the location for proximity of workers and access to the rail line. The city council approved the zoning change on June 5, 1947, but by June 26, 1947, NABISCO abandoned the project, building a plant at the northern edge of the Piedmont neighborhood on Columbia Boulevard. The plant was completed in August 1950.
The NE 60th Ave station on the Blue Line and Red Line of the MAX light rail system is on the boundary (Interstate 84) with the Center neighborhood.
In July 2008, "Forbes" magazine named Rose City Park the ninth most overpriced neighborhood in the country. This was based on a price-to-earnings spread comparing rental costs with buying costs for similar properties, based on number of bedrooms, location and price per square foot. A neighborhood with a high price-to-earnings spread is considered overvalued because a buyer is getting a low return based on costs and paying a huge premium to live in area relative to how much it would cost to rent a similar property there.

Legislative districts of Antique

The legislative districts of Antique are the representations of the province of Antique in the various national legislatures of the Philippines. The province is currently represented in the lower house of the Congress of the Philippines through its lone congressional district.
It was part of the representation of Region VI from 1978 to 1984. The province has never been redistricted, and its boundaries have remained constant since then. It is among the original representative districts from 1907 which has never changed in territorial coverage.
Senatorial representation.
Between 1916 and 1935, Antique was represented in the Senate of the Philippines through the 8th senatorial district of the Philippine Islands. However, in 1935, all senatorial districts were abolished when a unicameral National Assembly was installed under a new constitution following the passage of the Tydings–McDuffie Act, which established the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Since the 1941 elections, when the Senate was restored after a constitutional plebiscite, all twenty-four members of the upper house have been elected countrywide at-large.
Congressional representation.
Antique has been represented in the lower house of various Philippine national legislatures since 1898, through its at-large congressional district.
Provincial board districts.
The municipalities of Antique are represented in the Antique Provincial Board, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial legislature) of the province, through Antique's first and second provincial board districts.

Moon's Milk (In Four Phases)

Moon's Milk (In Four Phases) is a release by Coil that compiles four of their EPs onto a double CD. The two-disc album compiles the CD versions of ', ', ' and ' (originally recorded throughout 1998, and released seasonally from March 1998 to January 1999). The album also has a live version of "Amethyst Deceivers" hidden at the end of the first disc, following several minutes of silence after "A Warning from the Sun (For Fritz)". This recording of "Amethyst Deceivers" was later released on "Live Two", although the "Moon's Milk" version is a slightly longer edit. The release was given the catalog number ESKATON 023 and features artwork by Steven Stapleton.
Release.
At the time of release, a mail order edition was offered for an additional $85, comprising the standard 2-CD set with the "Moon's Milk (In Four Phases) Bonus Disc", a CDr of extra material presented in sleeves that John Balance had individually hand-painted. The bonus disc was limited to 333 copies, 300 of which were offered for sale and 33 of which were supposedly withheld by Balance for his personal collection.
Reissues.
Proposed "Moon's Milk (In Six Phases)" set.
In 2006, Threshold House announced "Moon's Milk (In Six Phases)", a "deluxe gallery edition" 3CD/book set that was to compile their four "Equinox" and "Solstice EPs", the three tracks from the "Moon's Milk (In Four Phases) Bonus Disc" and "some new reinterpretations of those songs". The book was to feature photographs of the 333 hand-painted covers for the "Moon's Milk (In Four Phases) Bonus Disc" along with a listing of their titles and respective owners.
While the "Black Antlers" and "The Remote Viewer" re-releases were made available as announced, Peter Christopherson was never to issue "Moon's Milk (In Six Phases)" in his lifetime. His passing made it uncertain whether the package would ever eventuate as there had been no further Coil releases or reissues for years afterwards. Danny Hyde, who worked with Christopherson on the proposed reissue, eventually released the additional material that had been intended for the third disc of the set. Issued as "Moon's Milk in Final Phase", the three tracks were credited to Electric Sewer Age rather than Coil.
Dais Records reissue.
On November 29, 2023, Dais Records announced that they would reissue "Moon's Milk (In Four Phases)" on March 15, 2024 in digital and physical formats. The release includes the limited edition "Moon's Milk (In Four Phases) Bonus Disc" as bonus tracks.

Philip Jones Brass Ensemble

The Philip Jones Brass Ensemble, founded in 1951 by trumpeter Philip Jones, was one of the first modern classical brass ensembles to be formed. The group played either as a quintet or as a ten-piece, for larger halls. It toured and recorded extensively, and numerous arrangements were commissioned, many of which were bequeathed on Jones' death to the library of the Royal Northern College of Music.
The ensemble recorded Leonard Salzedo's signature fanfare for the Open University's television transmissions.
Following Philip Jones' retirement in 1986, a number of the members of the group continued to collaborate, yet changed their name to London Brass.

Golem (klezmer band)

Golem is a rock-klezmer band from New York City. They mix traditional Eastern European Jewish music with original material sung in Yiddish, English, Russian, as well as Ukrainian, French, Serbo-Croatian, and Romany. The group describes itself as "Where Eastern Europe Meets the Lower East Side" and uses avant-garde spectacle to both challenge and embrace the stylistic norms of klezmer music.
Music.
Golem's music is both traditional and irreverent. Annette Ezekiel Kogan formed Golem in 2000. Before even putting the band together she contacted David Krakauer, who was then curating the weekly "Klezmer Brunch" at the downtown venue Tonic, and asked him for a gig. Krakauer agreed, and Ezekiel Kogan put together the first lineup for Golem’s debut.
Golem recorded its first EP Golem in 2001, followed by the self-produced full-length albums "Libeshmertzn (Love Hurts)" (2002) and "Homesick Songs" (2004).
In June, 2005, Golem recreated a "mock wedding", based on an old Catskills’ tradition, at the Knitting Factory in New York. An entire Jewish wedding ceremony took place before 200 "guests", complete with rabbi, chuppah, wedding party, and bride and groom in drag. The event was featured on the front page of the "NY Times" Arts section.
In 2005, Golem signed with Jdub Records and remained with them until the label closed in 2011. Golem released two albums on Jdub: "Fresh Off Boat" (2006) and "Citizen Boris" (2009), both produced by Emery Dobyns (Patti Smith, Antony and the Johnsons).
Numerous guest artists participated in Golem’s recordings, including Amanda Palmer, Lenny Kaye, Mike Gordon and Brandon Seabrook.
In June, 2014, Golem released the album "Tanz", produced by Tony Maimone (Pere Ubu) on the Mexican world music label, Discos Corasón (Buena Vista Social Club).
Golem performed live on an episode of Season 4 of Louis CK’s acclaimed television comedy, "Louie", in June 2014. In 2017 Golem performed live on VICELAND show The Untitled Action Bronson Show. In 2020 Golem was a featured in S1E7 of Amazon's Hunters and S1E4 of Netflix' Dash &amp; Lily.

El Gato Negro

El Gato Negro ("The Black Cat") is the name of two fictional American comic book superheroes created by Richard Dominguez and featured in the Azteca Productions' Universe. Both characters made their first appearance in "El Gato Negro #1" (October 1993).
In the comic's continuity, Agustin Guerrero was the first to hold the title of El Gato Negro in the 1950s, creating the pseudonym in order to form a successful career in lucha libre. His motives soon changed however, as he decided to use his talents to fight the criminal element that plagued South Texas. Agustin later retired the alter ego in the late '60s, only for his grandson to adopt it three decades later. Agustin was first introduced as a major supporting character and there are plans to release a series featuring his own exploits as El Gato Negro.
Francisco Guerrero, the second and current incarnation of El Gato Negro, is Agustin's grandson. Francisco makes his living as a social worker in South Texas and devotes most of his free time volunteering for community service. Growing tired of the increasing crime rate in the Lower Rio Grande Valley and haunted by the murder of his friend Mario, Francisco continues the legacy of El Gato Negro, spending his nights fighting against crime. This version often receives comparison to Batman, which is in fact one of the character's many influences.
Publication history.
Early years.
The El Gato Negro characters were created by comic book artist and writer Richard Dominguez, both making their first published appearance in "El Gato Negro" #1 (October 1993) published under Dominguez's own Azteca Productions imprint. The original series followed the adventures of Francisco Guerrero, a social worker living in Edinburg, Texas and grandson to the original El Gato Negro, who adopted his grandfather's former nom de guerre in order to avenge the death of his best friend. The series also introduced Agustin Guerrero, the original El Gato Negro of the early '50s and late '60s, as a major supporting character. Although the character officially retired from his former vigilante-activities, Agustin did appear in costume at the climax of the first story-arc entitled, "Unknown passing, Unforgettable Return" ("El Gato Negro" #1-3).
Dominguez had originally intended to introduce El Gato Negro as member of a largely Latino superhero group dubbed "Team Tejas", but after placing considerably more emphasis on his character development, Dominguez ultimately decided to abandon the Team Tejas project for a later date. The character's secret identity, Francisco Guerrero, was devised to have direct ties to the Mexican Revolution. His given name was borrowed from Mexican revolutionary Francisco "Pancho" Villa, while the surname Guerrero was mainly chosen for its English-translation "warrior", although Dominguez has hinted at a more historical significance, one which has yet to be revealed. Meanwhile, the shared alter-ego of "El Gato Negro" originated from an abandoned settlement by the name of "El Gato", located south of Pharr, Texas.
The character's personality and visual design was greatly influenced by Dominguez's own favorite pulp and comic book superheroes (most noticeably "Batman") along with classic Mexican luchadors such as El Santo. Another strong influence was Lee Falk's "The Phantom", a crime-fighter believed to be immortal but is in fact descended from 20 previous generations of crime-fighters who all adopted the same persona. This, along with Dominguez's own appreciation of the Silver Age of Comics, inspired the creation of a predecessor to the modern-day El Gato Negro. This character is now known as Agustin Guerrero, a former luchador-turned-adventurer of the late '50s and '60s.
The Francisco Guerrero incarnation of El Gato Negro became a popular character soon after his introduction, the first printing of the series actually sold-out within two months. A notable 1997 issue revived Margarito C. Garza's "Relampago" character, his first published appearance in nearly fifteen years. The series was later placed on hiatus during the late '90s, although the character consistently made appearances in other media.
2000s.
In 2004, rather than return to the original series, Dominguez launched a brand new series continuing the adventures of El Gato Negro entitled, "". For this, Dominguez enlisted the aid of Michael S. Moore to serve as writer and co-plotter, having previously worked together on the first published issue of "Team Tejas". The series also featured the work of guest penciller Efren Molina, while Dominguez acted as letterer and inker. The combination of Moore's writing style and Molina's pencils gave the new series a few stylistic changes from its predecessor.
Plans to release a compilation series of the original "El Gato Negro" series are currently in the works. A brand new limited series entitled "Lucha Grande Comics" which will feature the early adventures of Agustin Guerrero is also in development.
Fictional character biographies.
Agustin "Gus" Guerrero.
Separated from the Texas Battalion while on a raid, Agustin became lost in the harsh jungles of Korea only to encounter an exiled Japanese warrior and assassin known as "The Black Cat". Forming an alliance, the Black Cat properly trained the lost Tejano in martial arts and stealth. After being rescued and discharged from the military, Agustin returned to South Texas to begin a career in Lucha Libre. Recognizing a recurring cat motif in his life, Agustin chose the identity of El Gato Negro, promising to bring bad luck to his opponents. However, it was his vigilante activities outside of the ring that made him a legend among the communities of South Texas. Agustin's incarnation of El Gato Negro had become so much a part of the local folklore that few even acknowledge his existence, referring to him as a "fairy tale". His motives soon changed, however, as he decided to use his talents to fight the criminal element that plagued South Texas. Agustin later retired the alter ego in the late 1960s, only for his grandson to adopt it three decades later.
Francisco "Pancho" Guerrero.
The second and current El Gato Negro, Francisco Guerrero is a social worker by day and a vigilante by night. The citizens of Southwest Texas believe Francisco to be the original El Gato Negro, returning once again to rid Texas of evil. Prior to becoming the new El Gato, Francisco was growing tired of the increasing crime rate in his hometown of Edinburg, Texas. The final straw being the death of his friend, Mario, a border patrol officer who was overpowered and murdered by several drug-runners. Deciding to take action, with the permission of his grandfather, Francisco adopted the moniker of El Gato Negro and operated as the Nocturnal Warrior for several months, successfully fighting against crime. Despite being popular with the citizens of his community, El Gato Negro is constantly being hunted by local law enforcement led by police Captain Miguel Bustamonte, Francisco's best friend and Mario's older brother.
Antonio Trujillo.
A former member of the EZLN in the Mexican state of Chiapas, Antonio emigrated to Edinburg, Texas, United States, along with his wife Rosarita, where they both struggled to adjust to their new lives. Fortunately, social worker Francisco Guerrero helped to get the couple settled in their new home and gain citizenship. Antonio later landed a job at a local mechanic shop, eventually becoming an owner of his own establishment Taller Trujillo. Francisco confided with his friend his identity as El Gato Negro, and in return for his help, Antonio is considered to be a "tech tool" and constructs much of the tools he needs to fight crime.
In other media.
Film adaptation.
As of January 2016, Richard Dominguez is currently working with writer-turned-director Michael S. Moore in directing and filming a live-action short-film adaptation titled "El Gato Negro: Prey".
Television adaptation.
In February 2019, "Deadline Hollywood" reported that MGM Television is developing an "El Gato Negro" television series, with Diego Boneta starring and executive producing the series through his production company Three Amigos, and with Joel Novoa co-executive producing. In September 2019, Robert Rodriguez joined the project to direct and executive produce, with the series originally set to be on Apple TV+.
In February 2024, Amazon Prime Video (which owns MGM) greenlit the series, now titled El Gato, for production in the spring of 2024.

<doc id="6911216" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6911216" title="Cinnamon sugar">
Cinnamon sugar

Cinnamon sugar is a mixture of ground cinnamon and granulated sugar used as a spice to flavor foods such as Belgian waffles, Snickerdoodle cookies, tortillas, coffee cake, French toast, and churros. It is also used to flavor apples, cereals, and other fruits. As McCormick describes cinnamon sugar, "it’s the comforting scent of Sunday morning cinnamon toast and mid-summer’s peach cobbler...the aroma of the holidays, with cinnamon cookies and spice cake."
History.
It is not known when the term "cinnamon sugar" first came about. Some books, like Bernard Fantus's "Candy Medication" in 1915, mention it. Fantus writes about "red cinnamon sugar" as one of the products created for medical purposes. But others, like an 1891 book of vegetarian cooking, do not. The latter book, in describing a recipe for apple custard, describes how "a little cinnamon sugar can be shaken over the top" is the appropriate topping. Apart from this, one of the earliest uses of the term "cinnamon sugar" is within the "book of cookery" used by Martha Washington and her descendants, purchased by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in 1892. In a recipe for stewing warden's pears, the spice mixture is directly mentioned: "Boyle them first in faire water, then pare &amp; stew them between 2 dishes of cinnamon sugar and rose water, or the same seasoning you may put them in a pie and bake them." 
In 1846, Charles Elme Francatelli, a British cook of Italian descent, published a cookbook in which he described shaking "some cinnamon sugar" on the surface of "cherry bread" (a British bread), German "Kouglauff," a German tourte of apricots, and on a brown-bread soufflé. 18 years later, in 1865, J.E. Tilton's cookbook talked about how the create the spice mixture, recommended that it be on eggs, and baked with as a possible replacement of "vanilla sticks." By 1881 J.E. Thompson Gill's cookbook still recommended how the mix could be made, but recommended it be applied on pound cakes instead. 17 years later, in 1898, a cooking encyclopedia would refer to the spice mixture when talking about cinnamon sticks and other desserts.&lt;ref name="TFG/cdacts"&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, "Hotel Monthly" published a cookbook that mentioned cinnamon sugar as a topping for French Baba, a type of cake. This was followed by the "National Baker" writing, in 1913, about the sprinkling of this mixture on "Parisian Cake."
During the 1920s and 1930s, the term "cinnamon sugar" was used in reference to cooking, primarily recommended as a garnish on desserts. While this spice mixture was mentioned in "The New Zealand Journal of Agriculture" in 1955, it would primarily appear in U.S.-publications, like the "Illinois Rural Electric News" in 1959, "American Home" in 1964, and the American Sugar Crystal Company's "Crystal-ized Facts" in 1967. In the 1970s and 1980s, the spice mixture was integrated into many cookbooks, and other publications, becoming a common topping for dessert dishes. By the early 1990s, cinnamon sugar within books about early childhood education and in a cookbook of the fraternity Beta Sigma Phi.
In the 21st century, the term has remained as staple of cookbooks, mostly when it comes to desserts, including vegan recipes.
Use.
This spice mixture has not only been used to flavor funnel cakes and other treats, but it has been mentioned in patents and as part of recipes. The latter is where many results of the term derive, as the term "cinnamon sugar" is often used in cookbooks. This spice mixture has also been used in scientific studies about bean flour, a natural remedy of cinnamon sugar to "treat" dermatitis, and others, while being part of the promotional materials of companies like King Arthur Flour. There is currently a propellant developed for astronauts which has the moniker of "cinnamon sugar." 
Poems have mentioned the spice mixture as well, like Nancy Gillespie Westerfield's 1976 work, which talks about how the main character toasted her bread with the spice mixture, reminding her of "sweet things" from her girlhood, or Mel Vavra's 2001 work, which poses the protagonist as "a Cinnamon-Sugar girl."
In the United States cinnamon and sugar are "often used to flavour cereals, bread-based dishes, and fruits, especially apples," while in the Middle East cinnamon is "often used in savory dishes of chicken and lamb" and in the preparation of chocolate in Mexico. In South Africa there is a famous dessert pastry called melktert which is "lightly flavoured with cinnamon sugar."

Legislative districts of Bacolod

The legislative districts of Bacolod are the representations of the highly urbanized city of Bacolod in the various national legislatures of the Philippines. The city is currently represented in the lower house of the Congress of the Philippines through its lone congressional district.
It was represented as part of the at-large district of Negros Occidental from 1898 to 1899, 1943 to 1944, and 1985 to 1986, the second district of Negros Occidental from 1907 to 1941 and 1945 to 1972, and of Region VI from 1978 to 1984.
Senatorial representation.
Between 1916 and 1935, the then-municipality of Bacolod, under the province of Negros Occidental, was represented in the Senate of the Philippines through the 8th senatorial district of the Philippine Islands. However, in 1935, all senatorial districts were abolished when a unicameral National Assembly was installed under a new constitution following the passage of the Tydings–McDuffie Act, which established the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Since the 1941 elections, when the Senate was restored after a constitutional plebiscite, all twenty-four members of the upper house have been elected countrywide at-large.
Congressional representation.
Bacolod has been represented in the lower house of various Philippine national legislatures since 1943, through its at-large congressional district.

Isaka is a small town and station on the narrow-gauge Mwanza railway line of Tanzania which connects to the seaport of Dar es Salaam.
Transport.
It is located in Kahama Rural District of Shinyanga Region. In the 1980s a dry port was established there to serve the landlocked countries of Burundi and Rwanda, since Isaka is on a highway, now paved, running 610 km from the Rwandan capital, Kigali. The dry port functions as a sub-port of Dar es Salaam. Road transport companies can collect containers coming from overseas at Isaka and clear customs there, and deliver containers going overseas to the same location. Isaka also handles containers for the north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In 2017, a new station on the standard gauge railway is proposed.
In 2006, China offered funds to carry out feasibility studies to extend the Tanzanian Railway system to serve Burundi and Rwanda directly. There is an alternate plan to connect these landlocked countries to the Cape Gauge southern African railway network via DR Congo, but the DR Congo network itself is still in poor condition. Burundi and Rwanda are also connected by paved highway to Kampala which has a rail link to the seaport of Mombasa.

Goodwin Wharton

Goodwin Wharton (8 March 1653 – 28 October 1704) was an English Whig politician and autobiographer, as well as an avid mystic, alchemist and treasure hunter. His unpublished manuscript autobiography, in the British Library, "ranks high in the annals of psychopathology" according to the historian Roy Porter.
Early life.
Goodwin Wharton was the third and youngest son out of the seven children of Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton and Jane Goodwin, daughter and heiress of Arthur Goodwin (died 1643), of Upper Winchendon, Buckinghamshire. He was privately educated in France and attended a Protestant academy in Caen in 1663–64. In public and family life he was overshadowed by his forceful older brother, Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton and Malmesbury.
Elected a member of Parliament for East Grinstead in 1680, he made a hot-headed speech in favour of excluding the Duke of York (later James II) from the throne and had to go into hiding for a time.
Fairies and visions.
Wharton sent two expeditions to Tobermory to try to raise a galleon from the Spanish Armada wrecked there. Some of his singularly unsuccessful treasure-hunting was done on the advice of a lover, the self-professed medium Mary Parish, who claimed to have placed him in contact with fairies. The soldier-politician John Wildman also became fascinated by Parish's predictions in 1684.
In the following year, Wharton began to receive messages that ostensibly came directly from God and several of his angels. Many of these concerned the prospect of seducing a number of women, including his stepmother, Anne Carr Popham. He claimed to have had an affair with his sister-in-law, the poet Anne Wharton, in the early 1680s. He never married, but he was persuaded by Parish that Hezekiah Knowles, the son of an associate of hers, was his illegitimate son.
Admiralty lord.
Wharton's mental instability seems to have gone unnoticed outside his family circle, but he was out of favour under James II for his pronounced Whiggery, despite making representations to his consort, Mary of Modena (and fantasizing about having an affair with her). With the Glorious Revolution he rose to some eminence and was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of cavalry.
Wharton inherited Buckinghamshire estates on his father's death in 1696. He had been elected to Parliament again in 1690, and sat successively for Westmoreland, Malmesbury, Cockermouth, and the shire of Buckinghamshire until his death. He was one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in 1697–99. He suffered a stroke in 1698, which ended his public career.

Juan Señor

Juan Antonio Señor Gómez (born 26 August 1958) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a central midfielder, currently a manager.
During his professional career he played mainly for Zaragoza, making nearly 375 official appearances in nine years. The scorer of one of Spain's most important goals, he earned 41 caps during the 1980s, representing the nation in one World Cup and one European Championship.
Club career.
Señor was born in Madrid. During his career, the Real Madrid youth graduate represented CD Ciempozuelos (Tercera División), Deportivo Alavés (Segunda División) and Real Zaragoza as a professional. He played 369 competitive games with the Aragonese club, scoring 70 goals.
In the 1986–87 season, which featured a second stage, Señor netted 11 times in 43 matches as Zaragoza finished fifth. He also helped the side to win the Copa del Rey in 1986, being voted by magazine "Don Balón" the league's best player in the 1982–83 campaign where he recorded 33 appearances and five goals.
Señor had to retire sooner than expected due to a heart disease, his last season being 1989–90. He subsequently moved into coaching, going on to work with CP Mérida, UD Salamanca, FC Cartagena and CD Logroñés, and also began running a football campus for children in the Aragonese Pyrenees.
On 27 February 2023, 20 years after he last managed, Señor was appointed at Primera Federación club Pontevedra CF. He was unable to prevent relegation, as second-bottom.
International career.
Señor made 41 appearances for Spain, his debut coming on 27 October 1982 in a UEFA Euro 1984 qualifier against Iceland, a 1–0 win in Málaga. Also during that stage, he scored the most important of his six international goals: on 23 December 1983, as the national team needed to win by 11 goals against Malta to qualify, he scored in the 85th in a final 12–1 result in Seville.
Señor was part of the nation's squads at Euro 1984 and the 1986 FIFA World Cup, where he scored another late goal, in a quarter-final penalty shootout loss to Belgium (1–1 after 120 minutes).

Man of the Year (1995 film)

Man of the Year is a 1995 mockumentary film written, directed by and starring Dirk Shafer. It is a fictionalized account of Shafer's reign as "Playgirl" magazine's 1992 "Man of the Year" and his struggle with reconciling his public persona as a sex symbol to women with his identity as a gay man. Shafer combines mock interviews (both with some of the actual people involved and with actors standing in for the actual people) with archive footage from Shafer's appearances on talk shows like "Donahue", "The Maury Povich Show" and "The Jerry Springer Show" (along with an early appearance on "Dance Fever") and recreations of events like his Playgirl photoshoots, his "fantasy date" with a "Playgirl" reader and the death of his friend Pledge Cartwright (played by actor Bill Brochtrup) of an AIDS-related illness to relate the story.
Critical response.
"Variety" gave "Man of the Year" a generally favorable review, calling the film "pleasant to watch and intermittently clever." However, it notes that Shafer's writing is "uneven" and that the film's "structure is a bit repetitive." "The New Yorker" largely concurred, noting that Shafer "keep[s] condescension at bay with some nice comic spins" but finding the use of the death of Shafer's friend as Shafer's catalyst for coming out to be self-serving. The "San Francisco Chronicle" was far harsher, deriding the film as a "vanity" production and complaining "There's no shape to "Man of the Year", no forward movement. "Man of the Year" doesn't even have the benefit of being hip." "The New York Times", however, found the film "gently satirical" with the use of real clips from Shafer's various talk show appearances creating a "tone of vertiginous loopiness." The "Times" also saw the metaphor in Shafer's experience to the pressure that society put on gay people to pretend to be straight.
DVD release.
"Man of the Year" was released on Region 1 DVD on February 23, 1999.

Pondok Indah

Pondok Indah is an upscale residential area in South Jakarta, Indonesia. It is one of the most prestigious suburb areas in Jakarta, and even in Indonesia. Pondok Indah is a much sought-after suburb by expatriates, conglomerates, celebrities, and government officials.
Houses in this suburb can cost upwards of millions of U.S. dollars in price. In 2021, the price range of houses in the suburb was equal to Beverly Hills, California.
Landmarks in the suburb include Pondok Indah Mall (one of the top five shopping malls in Indonesia according to Forbes) and Pondok Indah Hospital.
History.
Background.
Pondok Indah area was previously a vast expanse of dry fields, rice fields, and also a rubber and secondary crops plantations. At one point, the area was visited by a famous architect and urban developer, Ciputra, which according to him, the plantation area is very strategic, since it is bordered by Jalan Ciputat Raya (which was previously part of the National Road from Jakarta to Bogor that passed through Palmerah, Ciputat, and Parung) to the west and Lebak Bulus to the south. The plantation is located near Kebayoran Baru (the first modern satellite city in Indonesia) and is not a flood-prone area, and the soil does not contain salt like in the northern region of Jakarta. The area was also still a stretch of mild forest and a source of clean water.
Ciputra felt that Jakarta would reach its population boom in the 1970s. He predicted that a large number of vertical housings would occupy Jakarta in the future. That became the reason for him to redevelop the plantation area into a new satellite city. 
Realization.
On developing Pondok Indah, Ciputra partners with Sudono Salim which at the time Salim wanted to develop Sunter area, Jakarta. Pitching that the plantation has better soil and air quality compared to Sunter, Salim agreed to work together and finance the development of Pondok Indah. He later said:
Early development.
Ciputra and his colleagues started the development in the 70s. He only built few houses, since Ciputra felt that the behavioral of the elites which want to design and build their own houses.
Ciputra was worried because the budget to acquire land and build road infrastructure and waterways were enormous. Therefore, they build small houses in the north of Pondok Indah area to grab quick funds, which were sold out quickly. Most interested people were whom have been rich for a long time, and new rich people who have emerged as a result of business activity.

Van Diemen's Land Company

The Van Diemen's Land Company (also known as Van Dieman Land Company) is a farming corporation in the Australian state of Tasmania. It was founded in 1825 and received a royal charter the same year, and was granted 250,000 acres (1,000 km2) in northwest Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) in 1826. The company's initial investors were a group of London merchants who planned a wool growing venture to supply the needs of the British textile industry. 
History.
Establishment.
In the early 1820s, the colonial authorities of the British Empire under Lord Bathurst, favoured large private corporations and wealthy individuals to develop and commercialise the significant land assets located in the Australian colonies. This policy was implemented to ensure a cheap supply of quality wool for the growing textile factories in Britain, and also to concentrate the profits obtained from this development to remain within the established privileged social classes.
In 1824, two corporations were subsequently formed: the Australian Agricultural Company, organised by the powerful capitalist John Macarthur; and the Van Diemen's Land Company, which was under the directorship of James Bischoff with the colonists William Sorell and Edward Curr enlisted as managers. 
While the Australian Agricultural Company focused on property assets in New South Wales, the directors of the Van Diemen's Land Company sought a 500,000-acre land grant in the uncolonised north-west region of Van Diemen's Land between Port Sorell and Cape Grim. In November 1825, a royal charter was issued for the company, but the associated (6 Geo. 4. c. 39) only authorised a land grant for half the requested size. However, by 1828 this was increased to 350,000 acres spread across several immense blocks, with the company effectively monopolising the whole north-west region.
The Van Diemen's Land Company established its headquarters at Circular Head under the management of Edward Curr who arrived in Van Diemen's Land in 1826. Much of the initial cargo, stock and farm labourers arrived in Van Diemen's Land aboard . Company surveyors, such as Henry Hellyer, explored and mapped out the most desirable areas of land, with the company eventually staking large claims at places which became known as Woolnorth, Circular Head, Robbins Island, Middlesex Plains, Hampshire Hills, Surrey Hills and Emu Bay. 
The land taken up by the company was occupied by the Peerapper people of Aboriginal Tasmanians, who had maintained their hunting ground grasslands for centuries through firestick farming methods. These lands were now to be forcefully appropriated by the company for sheep farming and other agricultural pursuits. Edward Curr implemented an intensely violent policy against the Peerapper, openly stating that successful occupation of the land would only be achieved by the extermination or expulsion of the Indigenous population.
Several large massacres of the Peerapper were conducted by the employees of the Van Diemen's Land Company under Curr's reign, including the Cape Grim massacre. By 1835, the Peerapper had been completely erased from the entire region, either by being killed or being removed to the Wybalenna Aboriginal Establishment on Flinders Island.
For many years the costs of farming were only just recovered. By the 1880s the company was making more money from timber felling and timber exports than from farming.
The Van Diemen's Land Company introduced bounties on the thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) from as early as 1830, which was a partial cause of their extinction. The company's presence also led to the decimation of local populations of the Tasmanian Emu, which also became extinct.
The company was the constructor of the early stages of the Emu Bay Railway between 1875 and 1884.
Recent divestiture and change in ownership.
The company managed to retain some of its original land grant during the 20th century, but by the 1970s it only owned the Woolnorth part, which amounted to just one seventh of its original selection.
In July 2014 it was announced the owner of the Van Diemen's Land Company, New Plymouth District Council (through Taranaki Investment Management Limited) in New Zealand, was attempting to sell the company. 
On 6 November 2015, Australian company OnCard announced its entrance into an agreement to buy the Van Diemen's Land Company. The agreement, worth $250 million followed OnCard's acquisition of another dairy food products business, Meander Valley Dairy. 
In 2016, Moon Lake Investments, controlled by Lu Xianfeng, purchased it for A$280 million. Moon Lake Investments has since changed its name to Van Dairy Limited. In 2021, 12 farms comprising 2,200 hectares were sold to Prime Value, an asset manager based in Melbourne, for A$62.5 million. Later in 2021, 6,000 hectares in the Woolnorth area were sold to TRT Pastoral Group for over A$120 million. In February 2024, Van Dairy lost a major milk contract with Fonterra, resulting in the reduction of its herd of cows by at least 700, and possibly thousands. In March 2024, another 700 hectares of land was sold to Prime Value for A$15 million.

Camp Bonifas

Camp Bonifas is a United Nations Command military post located south of the southern boundary of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). It is south of the Military Demarcation Line, which forms the border between South Korea (the Republic of Korea) and North Korea (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea). It was returned to the Republic of Korea in 2006.
Overview.
Camp Bonifas is home to the United Nations Command Security Battalion-Joint Security Area (JSA), whose primary mission is to monitor and enforce the Korean Armistice Agreement of 1953 between North and South Korea. Republic of Korea and United States Forces Korea soldiers (known as "security escorts") conduct the United Nations Command DMZ Orientation Program tours of the JSA and surrounding areas. The camp has a gift shop which sells DMZ- and JSA-related souvenirs.
The camp, formerly known as Camp Kitty Hawk, was renamed on August 18, 1986, in honor of U.S. Army Captain Arthur G. Bonifas (posthumously promoted to major), who along with First Lieutenant Mark T. Barrett (posthumously promoted to captain), were killed by North Korean soldiers in the "Korean axe murder incident".
Access to the Neutral Nations Monitors (Sweden and Switzerland), on Camp Swiss-Swede, was through Camp Bonifas.
There is a par 3 one-hole "golf course" at the camp which includes an AstroTurf green and is surrounded on three sides by minefields. "Sports Illustrated" called it "the most dangerous hole in golf" and there are reports that at least one shot detonated a land mine.
Kevin Sullivan of "The Washington Post" reported in 1998 that Camp Bonifas was a "small collection of buildings surrounded by triple coils of razor wire just 440 yards south of the DMZ" that, were it not for the minefields and soldiers, would "look like a big Boy Scout camp".

Alpana Singh

Alpana Singh (born November 1976) is an American Master Sommelier, restaurateur and local television personality in Chicago, Illinois.
Early life.
Singh was born and raised in Monterey, California to Indo-Fijian parents who emigrated from Fiji to California. The family owned and ran an ethnic grocery store. Her father was a chef for 30 years.
Career.
Singh's first job in the restaurant business outside the family business was as a waitress at Bakers Square. After an aborted attempt to join the US Air Force (due to a failed medical exam), she applied for a job at a fine dining restaurant but needed better background on wines. She self-educated and re-applied for the job, impressing the interviewer, who hired her and encouraged her to continue her studies. She became a sales clerk at Nielsen Bros. Market in Carmel, California which further exposed her to the wine business.
Singh passed the Court of Master Sommeliers' advanced certification test at age 21. In 2003, she passed the final exam to become the youngest woman ever to achieve the rank of Master Sommelier. (The master sommelier exam has an approximately 3% pass rate.)
Beginning at age 23, she served as sommelier at Chicago restaurant, Everest. She later became Director of Wine and Spirits for Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, a large Chicago-based chain of restaurants.
Singh became especially well known for hosting the local Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) public television station WTTW's restaurant review show "Check, Please!" and her regular appearances on "Chicago Tonight" for the "Ask Alpana" segment on Thursday evenings. She replaced the original host of "Check, Please!", Amanda Puck, in October 2003 and remained in that role until 2013, when she was replaced by Catherine De Orio. In 2018, however, Singh was reported to be returning to the show, signing a two-year contract.
Singh authored the 2006 book "Alpana Pours: About Being a Woman, Loving Wine, and Having Great Relationships" () and writes a column on wine for "RedEye".
In December 2012, Singh opened The Boarding House, a wine-driven concept in the River North neighborhood. The four-story restaurant received national attention from "Forbes Travel Guide" (Top 40 Tastemakers), "Food &amp; Wine" (Sommeliers of the Year), "Market Watch", "Sommelier Journal", "Restaurant Hospitality", "Midwest Living" and others. Additional accolades include "100 Best Wine Restaurants" ("Wine Enthusiast"), "Pastry Chefs to Watch" ("Time Out Chicago"), "2013 Best New Restaurants" ("Chicago Magazine"), and nominations for best restaurant design from the Eater Awards and Jean Banchet Awards. Singh closed out the restaurant’s first successful year with an all-female culinary and beverage team, and the honor of Sommelier of the Year 2013 Wine Star award from "Wine Enthusiast".
In 2014 and 2015, Singh appeared as a judge on the Food Network television show "Food Truck Face Off". The television show premiered just prior to Singh running her first marathon and opening her second restaurant, Seven Lions, an American concept, located on Chicago's Michigan Avenue.
Singh sold her ownership in Seven Lions in October 2017 while preparing to run for public office (Cook County commissioner for the Third District), which she later decided against pursuing. According to "Eater", Singh stated in July 2018 she sold ownership of both her restaurants The Boarding House and Seven Lions in October 2017. The Boarding House closed in July 2018. Singh still owns a third restaurant, Terra &amp; Vine, in nearby Evanston, Illinois.
In late 2020, after "The New York Times" reported on a culture of sexual harassment within the Court that had persisted for years, Singh renounced her Master Sommelier title as a show of support for the women who had come forward.
Personal life.
In 2006, Singh married fiction writer Charles Blackstone; the couple divorced in 2014.

Legislative districts of Baguio

The legislative districts of Baguio are the representations of the highly urbanized city of Baguio in the various national legislatures of the Philippines. The city is currently represented in the lower house of the Congress of the Philippines through its lone congressional district.
History.
In 1917, the city of Baguio, along with the undivided Mountain Province, was provided representation in the Philippine Legislature. Pursuant to the Revised Administrative Code (Act No. 2711) enacted on March 10, 1917, the non-Christian-majority areas of the Philippines, which then included the Mountain Province and Baguio, were to be collectively represented in the legislature's upper house by two senators from the 12th senatorial district, both appointed by the Governor-General. Three assembly members, also appointed by the Governor-General, were to represent the Mountain Province and the chartered city of Baguio in the lower house as a single at-large district.
The residents of Baguio and the Mountain Province only began electing representatives through popular vote in 1935 by virtue of Act No. 4203; the law provided the territorial coverage for each lower house representative district, while also abolishing the senatorial district system. The city was then represented as part of the Mountain Province's second district, which also included the sub-province of Benguet.
Areas now under the jurisdiction of Baguio were first represented separately during the Second World War. As a chartered city, two delegates represented Baguio in the National Assembly of the Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic: one was the city mayor (an "ex officio" member), while the other was elected through an assembly of KALIBAPI members within the city during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. Upon the restoration of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1945, the city reverted to its pre-war representation with the sub-province of Benguet as part of the undivided Mountain Province's second district.
The enactment of Republic Act No. 4695 on June 18, 1966 made the sub-province of Benguet into a full-fledged province. Per Section 10 of R.A. 4695 Baguio was to be part of the newly independent province's representative district. The new province of Benguet, along with Baguio, together elected one representative starting in the next general election.
Baguio was represented in the Interim Batasang Pambansa as part of Region I from 1978 to 1984. Having been classified as a highly urbanized city on 22 December 1979 through Batas Pambansa Blg. 51, Baguio was granted separate representation in the Regular Batasang Pambansa, returning one representative, elected at-large in 1984.
The city was once more grouped with Benguet under the new Constitution which was proclaimed on 11 February 1987. Baguio, despite being an independent city since 1909, comprised what was legally known between 1987 and 1995 as the first district of Benguet, while the territory of the actual province of Benguet itself comprised the second district. Both elected members to the restored House of Representatives starting that same year.
Starting in 1992, the first district of Benguet was re-designated as the "Legislative district of Baguio" thereby permitting the city to once again elect a representative under its own name.

Eloy Olaya

Eloy José Olaya Prendes (born 10 July 1964), known simply as Eloy, is a Spanish retired professional footballer who played as a forward.
Club career.
Eloy was born in Gijón, Asturias. During his career, he played for Sporting de Gijón (being part of a strong 80's team that achieved two fourth places in La Liga, in 1985 and 1987, with the player scoring 11 goals from 43 appearances in the latter season), Valencia CF (with roughly the same individual records, helping the "Che" to a runner-up spot in the 1989–90 campaign) and CD Badajoz (retiring after an unassuming Segunda División spell). On 28 November 1979, aged only 15, he made his professional debut, appearing for the side in a Copa del Rey match against CD Turón as the Royal Spanish Football Federation did not allow clubs to field players from the reserves, which were able to also compete in the tournament in that period.
After retiring in 1998 at the age of 34, with top-tier totals of 430 games and 77 goals, Eloy served as director of football for his main club Sporting, from 2001 to 2006.
International career.
Eloy earned 15 caps and scored four goals for the Spain national team in five years. He was a participant in the 1986 FIFA World Cup where he netted against Algeria in a 3–0 win, also missing in a penalty shootout quarter-final loss to Belgium, and UEFA Euro 1988 (no appearances).
Eloy's debut came on 20 November 1985 in a 0–0 friendly with Austria, played in Zaragoza.

Herron Island

Herron Island is an island and census-designated place in central Case Inlet in the southern part of Puget Sound in the U.S. state of Washington. The Pierce County island has a land area of 1.2326 km2 (304.57 acres) and a population of 151 persons as of the 2010 census.
Herron Island is one of the few privately owned islands in Puget Sound. All access to the island is by boat, mostly aboard the HMC ferry, the "Charlie Wells", and a guest pass signed by an HMC member is necessary to board the ferry. The island is long, and 1/2 mile (800 m) across.
Corporate properties include the North Beach Park and small boat docks, the South Beach (undeveloped), roads and rights of way, Goodpastor Park and adjacent wetlands, Community Building and Fire Station, water system, ferry and ferry docks, as well as numerous greenbelt lots throughout the island. All other land is privately owned. Ownership of waterfront lots includes the tidelands down to the mean sea level.
History.
Herron Island was named by Charles Wilkes during the Wilkes Expedition of 1838–1842, to honor Lewis Herron, the expedition's cooper.
Herron Island is a completely private island. It was incorporated on April 30, 1958, as Herron Maintenance Co. (HMC), a non-profit, non-stock Washington corporation consisting of the owners and purchasers of property on Herron Island. HMC is governed by its bylaws and administered by an unsalaried Board of Trustees elected annually from the membership. The Board is responsible for overseeing the operations and maintenance of the corporation's properties, and establishing a balanced budget to fund these operations. Herron Island is funded solely by annual and special assessments paid by the members and by the ferry fee.
1792.
Lieutenant Peter Puget, under the command of Captain George Vancouver, explored what is now known as Case Inlet in Puget Sound, in May 1792. On the 23rd of May, the sailors didn't get underway until 8:00 AM, much later than usual, due to the very heavy fog in the area. Because a new group of Indians was encountered at the mouth of the Nisqually river, and Lt. Puget didn't know whether they were friendly or not, the ship delayed landing until 2:00 PM that afternoon. Just after the landing, another squall, with heavy rains and wind gusts, prevented them from proceeding any further that day.
The tiny island they landed upon was dubbed "Wednesday Island". It was actually Tuesday here, but the Vancouver expedition used "England time" throughout their explorations.
The ship's botanist, Archibald Menzies, whose job it was to explore every place they landed, refused to venture from the landing site to collect soil and botanical specimens, due to the heavy rain and wind.
1841.
In 1841, Lieutenant Charles Wilkes of the United States Navy, re-explored, re-charted (and frequently renamed) the islands of Puget Sound.
Large and important islands were renamed for his most important sailors. Smaller islands were renamed for his lesser sailors. Lt. Wilkes renamed Wednesday Island for Seaman Herron.

Dizu Plaatjies

Dizu Plaatjies (born 5 February 1959, Lusikisiki, Pondoland, South Africa) is a Xhosa musician best known for being the founder and former leader of the South African group, Amampondo. He is a graduate of the South African College of Music, University of Cape Town where he lectures in African Music.
Plaatjies started the percussion group Amampondo during the late 1970s. The group began with making music on the streets, but achieved international fame in the 1980s. The climax for the group was performing at the Wembley Stadium during the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute. The stage was set for Amamondo to conquer the world, and they had already been booked for a world tour, but the anti-apartheid campaign in exile from South Africa banned their performances for the next four years. During these difficult years, he received support from the Scandinavian countries.
Since leaving Amampondo Plaatjies has started a new ensemble called Ibuyambo. Dizu and the new group have presented numerous shows in a number of European countries, and perform regularly in South Africa.
Plaatjies is the son of an African traditional healer and late lady teacher Ntombiza, has himself been initiated in the Xhosa/Pondo tribal tradition. His interest in African percussion music has taken him to numerous countries on the continent with the result that he now owns a substantial collection of handmade musical instruments from sub-Saharan Africa. His latest recordings, made for the label Mountain Records, are titled "Ibuyambo" (2005), "African Kings" (2008) and "Ubuntu — The Common String" (2015), and illustrate this knowledge and interest. The last two releases won him SAMA Awards.
He was married to his partner Vuyo Mbewu on 27 September 2008. The couple have two children Ukwanda and Azile. Plaatjies has 4 children.

Jerry Bails

Jerry Gwin Bails (June 26, 1933 – November 23, 2006) was an American popular culturist. Known as the "Father of Comic Book Fandom," he was one of the first to approach the comic book field as a subject worthy of academic study, and was a primary force in establishing 1960s comics fandom.
Biography.
Early life.
Jerry G. Bails was born on June 26, 1933, in Kansas City, Missouri. A fan of comic books from a very early age, Bails was a particularly avid fan of "All-Star Comics", and its premiere superteam (the Justice Society of America) of whom he was "a fan since the first Justice Society adventure appeared in "All-Star Comics" #3 (Winter 1941)." He wrote in 1960 that by 1945, he "began my campaign to collect all the back issues of this magazine ["All-Star Comics"]," and six years later when the JSA was dropped, started to work towards their revival. In the letters column of "Fantastic Four" #22 (cover-dated Jan. 1964) the editor refers to him as "one of fandom's most articulate critics."
Education.
As a young man, he "sent samples of his art to EC ("and Al Feldstein was nice enough to respond with advice.")," before attending the University of Kansas City, from which he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Physics, and then his Master's degree in Math. A student teacher by 1953, he gained his Ph.D. in Natural science , and in 1960 moved to Detroit with his wife Sondra "to become Assistant Professor of Natural Science at Wayne State University."
Comics fandom.
Roots.
In 1953, Bails wrote to DC (c/o Julius Schwartz) to inquire about issues of "All-Star Comics". His letter was forwarded to former "Justice Society" writer Gardner Fox, and from Fox's reply of July 9, 1953, the two corresponded regularly. Bails was working steadily toward re-building his personal collection of the early issues of "All Star Comics", and was finally able to convince Fox in early 1959 to sell him Fox's personal bound copies of "All-Star Comics" #1-24. 
Bails said that he fell into comics fandom in large part due to his circumstances:

Austronesian peoples

The Austronesian people, sometimes referred to as Austronesian-speaking peoples, are a large group of peoples who have settled in Taiwan, maritime Southeast Asia, parts of mainland Southeast Asia, Micronesia, coastal New Guinea, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar that speak Austronesian languages. They also include indigenous ethnic minorities in Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Hainan, the Comoros, and the Torres Strait Islands. The nations and territories predominantly populated by Austronesian-speaking peoples are sometimes known collectively as Austronesia.
The group originated from a prehistoric seaborne migration, known as the Austronesian expansion, from Taiwan, circa 3000 to 1500 BCE. Austronesians reached the Batanes Islands in the northernmost Philippines by around 2200 BCE. They used sails some time before 2000 BCE. In conjunction with their use of other maritime technologies (notably catamarans, outrigger boats, lashed-lug boats, and the crab claw sail), this enabled phases of rapid dispersal into the islands of the Indo-Pacific, culminating in the settlement of New Zealand . During the initial part of the migrations, they encountered and assimilated (or were assimilated by) the Paleolithic populations that had migrated earlier into Maritime Southeast Asia and New Guinea. They reached as far as Easter Island to the east, Madagascar to the west, and New Zealand to the south. At the furthest extent, they might have also reached the Americas.
Aside from language, Austronesian peoples widely share cultural characteristics, including such traditions and traditional technologies as tattooing, stilt houses, jade carving, wetland agriculture, and various rock art motifs. They also share domesticated plants and animals that were carried along with the migrations, including rice, bananas, coconuts, breadfruit, "Dioscorea" yams, taro, paper mulberry, chickens, pigs, and dogs.
History of research.
The linguistic connections between Madagascar, Polynesia, and Southeast Asia, particularly the similarities between Malagasy, Malay, and Polynesian numerals, were recognized early in the colonial era by European authors. The first formal publication on these relationships was in 1708 by Dutch Orientalist Adriaan Reland, who recognized a "common language" from Madagascar to western Polynesia, although Dutch explorer Cornelis de Houtman observed linguistic links between Madagascar and the Malay Archipelago a century earlier, in 1603. German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster, who traveled with James Cook on his second voyage, also recognized the similarities of Polynesian languages to those of Island Southeast Asia. In his book "Observations Made during a Voyage round the World" (1778), he posited that the ultimate origins of the Polynesians might have been the lowland regions of the Philippines and proposed that they arrived to the islands via long-distance voyaging.
The Spanish philologist Lorenzo Hervás later devoted a large part of his "Idea dell'universo" (1778–1787) to the establishment of a language family linking the Malay Peninsula, the Maldives, Madagascar, Indonesia (Sunda Islands and Moluccas), the Philippines, and the Pacific Islands eastward to Easter Island. Multiple other authors corroborated this classification (except for the erroneous inclusion of Maldivian), and the language family came to be known as "Malayo-Polynesian", first coined by the German linguist Franz Bopp in 1841 (German: "malayisch-polynesisch"). The connections between Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and the Pacific Islands were also noted by other European explorers, including the Orientalist William Marsden and the naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster.
Johann Friedrich Blumenbach added Austronesians as the fifth category to his "varieties" of humans in the second edition of "De Generis Humani Varietate Nativa" (1781). He initially grouped them by geography and thus called Austronesians the "people from the southern world". In the third edition, published in 1795, he named Austronesians the "Malay race", or the "brown race", after correspondence with Joseph Banks, who was part of the first voyage of James Cook. Blumenbach used the term "Malay" due to his belief that most Austronesians spoke the "Malay idiom" (i.e., the Austronesian languages), though he inadvertently caused the later confusion of his racial category with the Malay ethnic group. The other varieties Blumenbach identified were the "Caucasians" (white), "Mongolians" (yellow), "Ethiopians" (black), and "Americans" (red). Blumenbach's definition of the "Malay" race is largely identical to the modern distribution of the Austronesian peoples, including not only Islander Southeast Asians but also the people of Madagascar and the Pacific Islands. Although Blumenbach's work was later used in scientific racism, Blumenbach was a monogenist and did not believe the human "varieties" were inherently inferior to each other. Rather, he believed that the Malay race was a combination of the "Ethiopian" and "Caucasian" varieties.
By the 19th century, however, a classification of Austronesians as being a subset of the "Mongolian" race was favored, as was polygenism. The Australo-Melanesian populations of Southeast Asia and Melanesia (whom Blumenbach initially classified as a "subrace" of the "Malay" race) were also now being treated as a separate "Ethiopian" race by authors like Georges Cuvier, Conrad Malte-Brun (who first coined the term "Oceania" as "Océanique"), Julien-Joseph Virey, and René Lesson.
The British naturalist James Cowles Prichard originally followed Blumenbach by treating Papuans and Indigenous Australians as being descendants of the same stock as Austronesians. But by his third edition of "Researches into the Physical History of Man" (1836–1847), his work had become more racialized due to the influence of polygenism. He classified the peoples of Austronesia into two groups: the "Malayo-Polynesians" (roughly equivalent to the Austronesian peoples) and the "Kelænonesians" (roughly equivalent to the Australo-Melanesians). He further subdivided the latter into the "Alfourous" (also "Haraforas" or "Alfoërs", the Native Australians), and the "Pelagian or Oceanic Negroes" (the Melanesians and western Polynesians). Despite this, he acknowledges that "Malayo-Polynesians" and "Pelagian Negroes" had "remarkable characters in common", particularly in terms of language and craniometry.
In linguistics, the Malayo-Polynesian language family also initially excluded Melanesia and Micronesia, due to the perceived physical differences between the inhabitants of these regions from Malayo-Polynesian speakers. However, there was growing evidence of their linguistic relationship to Malayo-Polynesian languages, notably from studies on the Melanesian languages by Georg von der Gabelentz, Robert Henry Codrington, and Sidney Herbert Ray. Codrington coined and used the term "Ocean" language family rather than "Malayo-Polynesian" in 1891, in opposition to the exclusion of Melanesian and Micronesian languages. This was adopted by Ray, who defined the "Oceanic" language family as encompassing the languages of Southeast Asia and Madagascar, Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia.
In 1899, the Austrian linguist and ethnologist Wilhelm Schmidt coined the term "Austronesian" (German: "austronesisch", from Latin "auster", "south wind"; and Greek "νῆσος", "island") to refer to the language family. Schmidt had the same motivations as Codrington: he proposed the term as a replacement to "Malayo-Polynesian", because he also opposed the implied exclusion of the languages of Melanesia and Micronesia in the latter name. It became the accepted name for the language family, with Oceanic and Malayo-Polynesian languages being retained as names for subgroups.
The term "Austronesian", or more accurately "Austronesian-speaking peoples", came to refer to people who speak the languages of the Austronesian language family. Some authors, however, object to the use of the term to refer to people, as they question whether there really is any biological or cultural shared ancestry between all Austronesian-speaking groups. This is especially true for authors who reject the prevailing "Out of Taiwan" hypothesis and instead offer scenarios where the Austronesian languages spread among preexisting static populations through borrowing or convergence, with little or no population movements.
Despite these objections, the general consensus is that the archeological, cultural, genetic, and especially linguistic evidence all separately indicate varying degrees of shared ancestry among Austronesian-speaking peoples that justifies their treatment as a "phylogenetic unit". This has led to the use of the term "Austronesian" in academic literature to refer not only to the Austronesian languages but also the Austronesian-speaking peoples, their societies, and the geographic area of Austronesia.
Some Austronesian-speaking groups are not direct descendants of Austronesians and acquired their languages through language shift, but this is believed to have happened only in a few instances, since the Austronesian expansion was too rapid for language shifts to have occurred fast enough. In parts of Island Melanesia, migrations and paternal admixture from Papuan groups after the Austronesian expansion (estimated to have started at around 500 BCE) also resulted in gradual population turnover. These secondary migrations were incremental and happened gradually enough that the culture and language of these groups remained Austronesian, even though in modern times, they are genetically more Papuan. In the vast majority of cases, the language and material culture of Austronesian-speaking groups descend directly through generational continuity, especially in islands that were previously uninhabited.
Serious research into the Austronesian languages and its speakers has been ongoing since the 19th century. Modern scholarship on Austronesian dispersion models is generally credited to two influential papers in the late 20th century: "The Colonization of the Pacific: A Genetic Trail" (Hill &amp; Serjeantson, eds., 1989) and "The Austronesian Dispersal and the Origin of Languages" (Bellwood, 1991). The topic is particularly interesting to scientists for the remarkably unique characteristics of the Austronesian speakers: their extent, diversity, and rapid dispersal.
Regardless, certain disagreements still exist among researchers with regards to chronology, origin, dispersal, adaptations to the island environments, interactions with preexisting populations in areas they settled, and cultural developments over time. The mainstream accepted hypothesis is the "Out of Taiwan" model first proposed by Peter Bellwood. But there are multiple rival models that create a sort of "pseudo-competition" among their supporters due to narrow focus on data from limited geographic areas or disciplines. The most notable of which is the "Out of Sundaland" (or "Out of Island Southeast Asia") model.
Geographic distribution.
Austronesians were the first humans with seafaring vessels that could cross large distances on the open ocean; this technology allowed them to colonize a large part of the Indo-Pacific region. Prior to the 16th-century colonial era, the Austronesian language family was the most widespread in the world, spanning half the planet from Easter Island in the eastern Pacific Ocean to Madagascar in the western Indian Ocean.
Languages of the Austronesian family are today spoken by about 386 million people (4.9% of the global population), making it the fifth-largest language family by number of speakers. Major Austronesian languages include Malay (around 250–270 million in Indonesia alone in its own literary standard, named Indonesian), Javanese, and Filipino (Tagalog). The family contains 1,257 languages, the second-largest number of any language family.
The geographic region that encompasses native Austronesian-speaking populations is sometimes referred to as "Austronesia". Other geographic names for various subregions include Malay Peninsula, Greater Sunda Islands, Lesser Sunda Islands, Island Melanesia, Island Southeast Asia, Malay Archipelago, Maritime Southeast Asia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Near Oceania, Oceania, Pacific Islands, Remote Oceania, Polynesia, and Wallacea. In Indonesia, the nationalistic term Nusantara, from Old Javanese, is also popularly used for the Indonesian islands.
Austronesian regions are almost exclusively islands in the Pacific and Indian oceans, with predominantly tropical or subtropical climates with considerable seasonal rainfall.
Inhabitants of these regions include Taiwanese indigenous peoples, most ethnic groups in Brunei, East Timor, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Micronesia, the Philippines, and Polynesia. Also included are the Malays of Singapore; the Polynesians of New Zealand, Hawaii, and Chile; the Torres Strait Islanders of Australia; the non-Papuan peoples of Melanesia and coastal New Guinea; the Shibushi speakers of the Comoros, and the Malagasy and Shibushi speakers of Réunion. Austronesians are also found in the regions of Southern Thailand; the Cham areas in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Hainan; and the Mergui Archipelago of Myanmar.
Additionally, modern-era migration has brought Austronesian-speaking people to the United States, Canada, Australia, the UK, mainland Europe, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Hong Kong, Macau, and West Asian countries.
Some authors also propose further settlements and contacts in the past in areas that are not inhabited by Austronesian speakers today. These range from likely hypotheses to very controversial claims with minimal evidence. In 2009, Roger Blench compiled an expanded map of Austronesia that encompassed these claims based on a variety of evidence, such as historical accounts, loanwords, introduced plants and animals, genetics, archeological sites, and material culture. They include areas like the Pacific coast of the Americas, Japan, the Yaeyama Islands, the Australian coast, Sri Lanka and coastal South Asia, the Persian Gulf, some Indian Ocean islands, East Africa, South Africa, and West Africa.
List of Austronesian peoples.
Austronesian peoples include the following groupings by name and geographic location (incomplete):
History.
Prehistory.
The broad consensus on Austronesian origins is the "two-layer model", where an original Paleolithic indigenous population in Island Southeast Asia were assimilated to varying degrees by incoming migrations of Neolithic Austronesian-speaking peoples from Taiwan and Fujian, in southern China, from around 4,000 BP. Austronesians also mixed with other preexisting populations as well as later migrant populations among the islands they settled, resulting in further genetic input. The most notable are the Austroasiatic-speaking peoples in western Island Southeast Asia (peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, and Java); the Bantu peoples in Madagascar and the Comoros; as well as Japanese, Persian, Indian, Arab, and Han Chinese traders and migrants in more recent centuries.
Paleolithic.
Island Southeast Asia was settled by modern humans in the Paleolithic following coastal migration routes, presumably starting before 70,000 BP from Africa, long before the development of Austronesian cultures. These populations are typified by having dark skin, curly hair, and short statures, leading Europeans to believe, in the 19th century, that they were related to African Pygmies. However, despite these physical similarities, genetic studies have shown that they are more closely related to other Eurasian populations than to Africans.
The lowered sea levels of the Pleistocene made some of the modern-day islands of Sundaland accessible via land bridges. However, the spread of humans across the Wallace line and into Sahul necessitated crossing bodies of water. Remains of stone tools and marine shells in Liang Sarru, Salibabu Island, North Sulawesi, dated to 32,000–35,000 years ago, is possible evidence for the longest sea voyage by Paleolithic humans ever recorded. The island was previously uninhabited by humans or hominins and can only be reached from either Mindanao or the Sangihe Islands by crossing an expanse of water at least wide, even during the low sea levels of the Pleistocene. Other evidence of early maritime transport are the appearance of obsidian tools with the same source on neighboring islands. These include the Philippine obsidian network (Mindoro and Palawan, ca.33,000-28,000 BP), and the Wallacea obsidian network (Timor, Atauro, Kisar, Alor, ca.22,000 BP). However, the method of crossing remains unknown and could have ranged from simple rafts to dugout canoes by the terminal Pleistocene.
These early settlers are generally historically referred to as "Australo-Melanesians", though the terminology is problematic, as they are genetically diverse, and most groups within Austronesia have significant Austronesian admixture and culture. The unmixed descendants of these groups today include the interior Papuans and Indigenous Australians.
In modern literature, descendants of these groups, located in Island Southeast Asia west of Halmahera, are usually collectively referred to as "Negritos", while descendants of these groups east of Halmahera (excluding Indigenous Australians) are referred to as "Papuans". They can also be divided into two broad groups based on Denisovan admixture. Philippine Negritos, Papuans, Melanesians, and Indigenous Australians display Denisovan admixture, while Malaysian and western Indonesian Negritos (Orang Asli) and Andamanese islanders do not.
Mahdi (2017) also uses the term "Qata" (from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *qata) to distinguish the indigenous populations of Southeast Asia, versus "Tau" (from Proto-Austronesian *Cau) for the later settlers from Taiwan and mainland China. Both are based on proto-forms for the word "person" in Malayo-Polynesian languages that referred to darker-skinned and lighter-skinned groups, respectively. Jinam "et al." (2017) also proposed the term "First Sundaland People" in place of "Negrito", as a more accurate name for the original population of Southeast Asia.
These populations are genetically distinct from later Austronesians, but through fairly extensive population admixture, most modern Austronesians have varying levels of ancestry from these groups. The same is true for some populations historically considered "non-Austronesians", due to physical differences—like Philippine Negritos, Orang Asli, and Austronesian-speaking Melanesians, all of whom have Austronesian admixture. In Polynesians in Remote Oceania, for example, the admixture is around 20 to 30% Papuan and 70 to 80% Austronesian. The Melanesians in Near Oceania are roughly around 20% Austronesian and 80% Papuan, while in the natives of the Lesser Sunda Islands, the admixture is around 50% Austronesian and 50% Papuan. Similarly, in the Philippines, the groups traditionally considered to be "Negrito" vary between 30 and 50% Austronesian.
The high degree of assimilation among Austronesian, Negrito, and Papuan groups indicates that the Austronesian expansion was largely peaceful. Rather than violent displacement, the settlers and the indigenous groups absorbed each other. It is believed that in some cases, like in the Toalean culture of Sulawesi (c. 8,000–1,500 BP), it is even more accurate to say that the densely populated indigenous hunter-gatherer groups absorbed the incoming Austronesian farmers, rather than the other way around. Mahdi (2016) further asserts that Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *tau-mata ("person") is derived from a composite protoform *Cau ma-qata, combining "Tau" and "Qata" and indicative of the mixing of the two ancestral population types in these regions.
Neolithic China.
The broad consensus on the Urheimat (homeland) of Austronesian languages as well as the Neolithic early Austronesian peoples is accepted to be Taiwan, as well as the Penghu Islands. They are believed to have descended from ancestral populations in coastal mainland southern China, which are generally referred to as the "preAustronesians". Through these pre-Austronesians, Austronesians may also share a common ancestry with neighboring groups in Neolithic southern China.
These Neolithic pre-Austronesians from the coast of southeastern China are believed to have migrated to Taiwan between approximately 10,000 and 6000 BCE. Other research has suggested that, according to radiocarbon dates, Austronesians may have migrated from mainland China to Taiwan as late as 4000 BCE (Dapenkeng culture). They continued to maintain regular contact with the mainland until 1500 BCE.
The identity of the Neolithic pre-Austronesian cultures in China is contentious. Tracing Austronesian prehistory in Fujian and Taiwan has been difficult due to the southward expansion of the Han dynasty (2nd century BCE) and the recent Qing dynasty annexation of Taiwan (1683 CE). Today, the only Austronesian language in southern China is Tsat, spoken in Hainan. The politicization of archaeology is also problematic, particularly erroneous reconstructions among some Chinese archaeologists of non-Sinitic sites as Han. Some authors, favoring the "Out of Sundaland" model, like William Meacham, reject the southern Chinese mainland origin of pre-Austronesians entirely.
Nevertheless, based on linguistic, archaeological, and genetic evidence, Austronesians are most strongly associated with the early farming cultures of the Yangtze River basin that domesticated rice from around 13,500 to 8,200 BP. They display typical Austronesian technological hallmarks, including tooth removal, teeth blackening, jade carving, tattooing, stilt houses, advanced boatbuilding, aquaculture, wetland agriculture, and the domestication of dogs, pigs, and chickens. These include the Kuahuqiao, Hemudu, Majiabang, Songze, Liangzhu, and Dapenkeng cultures that occupied the coastal regions between the Yangtze River delta and the Min River delta.
Relations with other groups.
Based on linguistic evidence, there have been proposals linking Austronesians with other linguistic families into linguistic macrofamilies that are relevant to the identity of the pre-Austronesian populations. The most notable are the connections of Austronesians to the neighboring Austroasiatic, Kra-Dai, and Sinitic peoples (as Austric, Austro-Tai, and Sino-Austronesian, respectively). These are still not widely accepted, as evidence of these relationships are still tenuous, and the methods used are highly contentious.
In support of both the Austric and Austro-Tai hypothesis, Robert Blust connects the lower Yangtze Neolithic Austro-Tai entity with the rice-cultivating Austroasiatic cultures, assuming the center of East Asian rice domestication, and putative Austric homeland, to be located in the Yunnan/Burma border area, instead of the Yangtze River basin, as is currently accepted. Under that view, there was an east–west genetic alignment, resulting from a rice-based population expansion, in the southern part of East Asia: Austroasiatic-Kra-Dai-Austronesian, with unrelated Sino-Tibetan occupying a more northerly tier. Depending on the author, other hypotheses have also included other language families like Hmong–Mien and even Japanese-Ryukyuan into the larger Austric hypothesis.
While the Austric hypothesis remains contentious, there is genetic evidence that at least in western Island Southeast Asia, there had been earlier Neolithic overland migrations (pre-4,000 BP) by Austroasiatic-speaking peoples into what is now the Greater Sunda Islands when the sea levels were lower, in the early Holocene. These peoples were assimilated linguistically and culturally by incoming Austronesian peoples in what is now modern-day Indonesia and Malaysia.
Several authors have also proposed that Kra-Dai speakers may actually be an ancient daughter subgroup of Austronesians that migrated back to the Pearl River Delta from Taiwan and/or Luzon, shortly after the Austronesian expansion, later migrating further westwards to Hainan, Mainland Southeast Asia, and Northeast India. They propose that the distinctiveness of Kra-Dai (it is tonal and monosyllabic) was the result of linguistic restructuring due to contact with Hmong–Mien and Sinitic cultures. Aside from linguistic evidence, Roger Blench has also noted cultural similarities between the two groups, like facial tattooing, tooth removal or ablation, teeth blackening, snake (or dragon) cults, and the multiple-tongued jaw harps shared by the indigenous Taiwanese and Kra-Dai-speakers. However, archaeological evidence for this is still sparse. This is believed to be similar to what happened to the Cham people, who were originally Austronesian settlers (likely from Borneo) to southern Vietnam around 2100–1900 BP and had languages similar to Malay. Their languages underwent several restructuring events to syntax and phonology due to contact with the nearby tonal languages of Mainland Southeast Asia and Hainan. Although the populations of the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, Java, and neighboring islands are Austronesian-speaking, they have significantly high admixture from Mainland Southeast Asian populations. These areas were already populated (most probably by speakers of Austroasiatic languages) before they were reached by the Austronesian expansion, roughly 3,000 years ago. Currently, only the indigenous Aslians still speak Austroasiatic languages. However, some of the languages in the region show signs of underlying Austroasiatic substrates.
According to Juha Janhunen and Ann Kumar, Austronesians may have also settled parts of southern Japan, especially on the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku, and influenced or created the Japanese hierarchical society. It is suggested that Japanese tribes like the Hayato people, the Kumaso, and the Azumi were of Austronesian origin. Until today, local traditions and festivals show similarities to Malayo-Polynesian culture.
The Sino-Austronesian hypothesis, on the other hand, is a relatively new hypothesis by Laurent Sagart, first proposed in 1990. It argues for a north–south linguistic genetic relationship between Chinese and Austronesian. This is based on sound correspondences in basic vocabulary and morphological parallels. Sagart places special significance in shared vocabulary on cereal crops, citing them as evidence of shared linguistic origin. However, this has largely been rejected by other linguists. The sound correspondences between Old Chinese and Proto-Austronesian can also be explained as a result of the Longshan interaction sphere, when pre-Austronesians from the Yangtze region came into regular contact with Proto-Sinitic speakers in the Shandong Peninsula, around the 4th to 3rd millennia BCE. This corresponded with the widespread introduction of rice cultivation to Proto-Sinitic speakers and conversely, millet cultivation to Pre-Austronesians. An Austronesian substratum in formerly Austronesian territories that have been Sinicized after the Iron Age Han expansion is also another explanation for the correspondences that do not require a genetic relationship.
In relation to Sino-Austronesian models and the Longshan interaction sphere, Roger Blench (2014) suggests that the single migration model for the spread of the Neolithic into Taiwan is problematic, pointing out the genetic and linguistic inconsistencies between different Taiwanese Austronesian groups. The surviving Austronesian populations in Taiwan should rather be considered as the result of various Neolithic migration waves from the mainland and back-migration from the Philippines. These incoming migrants almost certainly spoke languages related to Austronesian or pre-Austronesian, although their phonology and grammar would have been quite diverse.
Blench considers the Austronesians in Taiwan to have been a melting pot of immigrants from various parts of the coast of East China that had been migrating to Taiwan by 4000 BP. These immigrants included people from the foxtail millet-cultivating Longshan culture of Shandong (with Longshan-type cultures found in southern Taiwan), the fishing-based Dapenkeng culture of coastal Fujian, and the Yuanshan culture of northernmost Taiwan, which Blench suggests may have originated from the coast of Guangdong. Based on geography and cultural vocabulary, Blench believes that the Yuanshan people may have spoken Northeast Formosan languages. Thus, Blench believes that there is in fact no "apical" ancestor of Austronesian in the sense that there was no true single Proto-Austronesian language that gave rise to present-day Austronesian languages. Instead, multiple migrations of various pre-Austronesian peoples and languages from the Chinese mainland that were related but distinct came together to form what we now know as Austronesian in Taiwan. Hence, Blench considers the single-migration model into Taiwan by pre-Austronesians to be inconsistent with both the archaeological and linguistic (lexical) evidence.
Migration from Taiwan.
The Austronesian expansion (also called the "Out of Taiwan" model) is a large-scale migration of Austronesians from Taiwan, occurring around 3000 to 1500 BCE. Population growth primarily fueled this migration. These first settlers settled in northern Luzon, in the archipelago of the Philippines, intermingling with the earlier Australo-Melanesian population who had inhabited the islands since about 23,000 years earlier. Over the next thousand years, Austronesian peoples migrated southeast to the rest of the Philippines, and into the islands of the Celebes Sea and Borneo. From southwestern Borneo, Austronesians spread further west in a single migration event to both Sumatra and the coastal regions of southern Vietnam, becoming the ancestors of the speakers of the Malayic and Chamic branches of the Austronesian language family. A 2021 study, however, suggests an earlier divergence date between Cordilleran-related groups and populations from mainland East Asia and Taiwan at ~8,000 B.P., coinciding with the Cordilleran settlement of the Philippines.
Soon after reaching the Philippines, Austronesians colonized the Northern Mariana Islands by 1500 BCE or even earlier, becoming the first humans to reach Remote Oceania. The Chamorro migration was also unique in that it was the only Austronesian migration to the Pacific Islands to successfully retain rice cultivation. Palau and Yap were settled by separate voyages by 1000 BCE.
Another important migration branch was by the Lapita culture, which rapidly spread into the islands off the coast of northern New Guinea and into the Solomon Islands and other parts of coastal New Guinea and Island Melanesia by 1200 BCE. They reached the islands of Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga by around 900 to 800 BCE. This remained the furthest extent of the Austronesian expansion into Polynesia until around 700 CE, when there was another surge of island colonization. It reached the Cook Islands, Tahiti, and the Marquesas by 700 CE; Hawaii by 900 CE; Rapa Nui by 1000 CE; and New Zealand by 1200 CE. For a few centuries, the Polynesian islands were connected by bidirectional long-distance sailing, with the exception of Rapa Nui, which had limited further contact due to its isolated geographical location. Island groups like the Pitcairns, the Kermadec Islands, and the Norfolk Islands were also formerly settled by Austronesians but later abandoned. There is also putative evidence, based in the spread of the sweet potato, that Austronesians may have reached South America from Polynesia, where they might have traded with the Indigenous peoples of the Americas.
In the Indian Ocean, Austronesians in Maritime Southeast Asia established trade links with South Asia. They also established early long-distance contacts with Africa, possibly as early as before 500 BCE, based on archaeological evidence like banana phytoliths in Cameroon and Uganda and remains of Neolithic chicken bones in Zanzibar. By the end of the first millennium BCE, Austronesians were already sailing maritime trade routes linking the Han dynasty of China with the western Indian Ocean trade in India, the Roman Empire, and Africa. An Austronesian group, originally from the Makassar Strait region around Kalimantan and Sulawesi, eventually Madagascar, either directly from Southeast Asia or from preexisting mixed Austronesian-Bantu populations from East Africa. Estimates for when this occurred vary, from the 5th to 7th centuries CE. It is likely that the Austronesians that settled Madagascar followed a coastal route through South Asia and East Africa, rather than directly across the Indian Ocean. Genetic evidence suggests that some individuals of Austronesian descent reached Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.
Alternative views.
A competing hypothesis to the "Out of Taiwan" model is the "Out of Sundaland" hypothesis, favored by a minority of authors. Notable proponents include William Meacham, Stephen Oppenheimer, and Wilhelm Solheim. For various reasons, they have proposed that the homelands of Austronesians were within Island Southeast Asia (ISEA), particularly in the Sundaland landmass drowned during the end of the Last Glacial Period by rising sea levels. Proponents of these hypotheses point to the ancient origins of mtDNA in Southeast Asian populations, pre-dating the Austronesian expansion, as proof that Austronesians originated from within Island Southeast Asia.
However, these have been repudiated by studies using whole genome sequencing, which have found that all ISEA populations had genes originating from aboriginal Taiwanese. Contrary to the claim of a south-to-north migration in the "Out of Sundaland" hypothesis, the new whole genome analysis strongly confirms the north-to-south dispersal of the Austronesian peoples in the prevailing "Out of Taiwan" hypothesis. Researchers have further pointed out that while humans have been living in Sundaland for at least 40,000 years, the Austronesian people were recent arrivals. The results of the previous studies failed to take into account admixture with the more ancient but unrelated Negrito and Papuan populations.
Historical period.
By the beginning of the first millennium CE, most of the Austronesian inhabitants in Maritime Southeast Asia began trading with India and China. The adoption of the Hindu statecraft model allowed the creation of Indianized kingdoms, such as Tarumanagara, Champa, Butuan, Langkasuka, Melayu, Srivijaya, Mataram, Majapahit, and Bali. Between the 5th and the 15th century, Hinduism and Buddhism were established as the main religion in the region. Muslim traders from the Arabian Peninsula were thought to have brought Islam by the 10th century. This was established as the dominant religion in the Malay archipelago by the 16th century. The Austronesian inhabitants of Near Oceania and Remote Oceania were unaffected by this cultural trade and retained their indigenous culture in the Pacific region.
The Kingdom of Larantuka in Flores, East Nusa Tenggara, was the only Christian (Roman Catholic) indigenous kingdom in Indonesia and in Southeast Asia, with its first king named Lorenzo.
Western Europeans in search of spices and gold later colonized most of the Austronesian-speaking countries of the Asia-Pacific region, beginning in the 16th century, with the Portuguese and Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Palau, Guam, the Mariana Islands, and some parts of Indonesia (present-day East Timor); the Dutch colonization of the Indonesian archipelago; the British colonization of Malaysia and Oceania; the French colonization of French Polynesia; and later, the American governance of the Pacific.
Meanwhile, the British, Germans, French, Americans, and Japanese began establishing spheres of influence within the Pacific islands during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Japanese later invaded most of Southeast Asia and some parts of the Pacific during World War II. The latter half of the 20th century initiated independence of modern-day Indonesia, Malaysia, East Timor, and many of the Pacific island nations, as well as the re-independence of the Philippines.
Culture.
The native culture of Austronesia varies from region to region. The early Austronesian peoples considered the sea as the basic feature of their life. Following their diaspora to Southeast Asia and Oceania, they migrated by boat to other islands. Boats of different sizes and shapes have been found in every Austronesian culture, from Madagascar, Maritime Southeast Asia, to Polynesia, and have different names. In Southeast Asia, head-hunting was restricted to the highlands as a result of warfare. Mummification is only found among the highland Austronesian Filipinos and in some Indonesian groups in Celebes and Borneo.
Ships and sailing.
Seagoing catamaran and outrigger ship technologies were the most important innovations of the Austronesian peoples. They were the first humans with vessels capable of crossing vast distances of water. The crossing from the Philippines to the Mariana Islands at around 1500 BCE, a distance of more than , is likely the world's first and longest ocean crossing of that time. These maritime technologies enabled them to colonize the Indo-Pacific in prehistoric times. Austronesian groups continue to be the primary users of outrigger canoes today.
Early researchers like Heine-Geldern (1932) and Hornell (1943) once believed that catamarans evolved from outrigger canoes, but modern authors specializing in Austronesian cultures, like Doran (1981) and Mahdi (1988), now believe it to be the opposite.
Two canoes bound together developed directly from minimal raft technologies of two logs tied together. Over time, the double-hulled canoe form developed into the asymmetric double canoe, where one hull is smaller than the other. Eventually the smaller hull became the prototype outrigger, giving way to the single outrigger canoe, then to the reversible single outrigger canoe. Finally, the single outrigger types developed into the double outrigger canoe (or trimarans).
This would also explain why older Austronesian populations in Island Southeast Asia tend to favor double outrigger canoes, as it keeps the boats stable when tacking. However, there are small regions where catamarans and single-outrigger canoes are still used. In contrast, more distant outlying descendant populations in Micronesia, Polynesia, Madagascar, and the Comoros retained the double-hull and the single-outrigger canoe types, but the technology for double outriggers never reached them (although it exists in western Melanesia). To deal with the problem of the boat's instability when the outrigger faces leeward when tacking, they instead developed the shunting technique in sailing, in conjunction with reversible single-outriggers.
The simplest form of all ancestral Austronesian boats had five parts. The bottom consisted of a single piece of hollowed-out log. At the sides were two planks, and two horseshoe-shaped wood pieces formed the prow and stern. These were fitted tightly together edge-to-edge, with dowels inserted into holes in between, and then lashed to each other with ropes (made from rattan or fiber) wrapped around protruding lugs on the planks. This characteristic and ancient Austronesian boatbuilding practice is known as the "lashed-lug" technique. They were commonly caulked with pastes made from various plants as well as tapa bark and fibers that would expand when wet, further tightening joints and making the hull watertight. They formed the shell of the boat, which was then reinforced by horizontal ribs. Shipwrecks of Austronesian ships can be identified from this construction as well as the absence of metal nails. Austronesian ships traditionally had no central rudders but were instead steered using an oar on one side.
The ancestral rig was the mastless triangular crab claw sail, which had two booms that could be tilted to the wind. These were built in the double-canoe configuration or had a single outrigger on the windward side. In Island Southeast Asia, these developed into double outriggers on each side, which provided greater stability. The triangular crab claw sails also later developed into square or rectangular tanja sails, which, like crab claw sails, had distinctive booms spanning the upper and lower edges. Fixed masts also developed later in both Southeast Asia (usually as bipod or tripod masts) and Oceania. Austronesians traditionally made their sails from woven mats of the resilient and salt-resistant pandanus leaves. These sails allowed them to embark on long-distance voyaging. In some cases, however, they were one-way voyages. the motives of early Rapa Nui natives &amp; Maōri to established their settlement (New Zealand &amp; Easter Island) is believed to have isolated their settlements from the rest of Polynesia.
The ancient Champa of Vietnam also uniquely developed basket-hulled boats whose hulls were composed of woven and resin-caulked bamboo, either entirely or in conjunction with plank strakes. They ranged from small coracles ("o thúng") to large oceangoing trading ships like the "ghe mành".
The acquisition of catamaran and outrigger technology by non-Austronesian peoples in Sri Lanka and southern India is due to the result of very early Austronesian contact with the region, including the Maldives and the Laccadive Islands, estimated to have occurred around 1000 to 600 BCE and onwards. This may have possibly included limited colonization by people who have since been assimilated. This is still evident in Sri Lankan and South Indian languages. For example, Tamil "paṭavu", Telugu "paḍava", and Kannada "paḍahu", all meaning "ship", are all derived from Proto-Hesperonesian *padaw, "sailboat", with Austronesian cognates like Sundanese "parahu", Javanese "perahu", Kadazan "padau", Maranao "padaw", Cebuano "paráw", Samoan "folau", Hawaiian "halau", and Māori "wharau".
Architecture.
Austronesian architecture is diverse but often shares certain characteristics that indicate a common origin. The reconstructed Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian forms of various terms for "house", "building", or "granary" among the different linguistic subgroups of Austronesians include *rumaq ("house"); *balay ("public building", "community house", or "guest house"); *lepaw ("hut", "field hut", or "granary"); *kamaliR ("bachelor's house", or "men's house"); and *banua ("inhabited land", or "community territory").
Austronesian structures commonly have raised floors. The structures are raised on piles, usually with space underneath also utilized for storage or domestic animals. The raised design has multiple advantages, including mitigating damage during flooding and (in very tall examples) acting as defensive structures during conflicts. The house posts are also distinctively capped with larger-diameter discs at the top, to prevent vermin and pests from entering the structures by climbing them. Austronesian houses and other structures are usually built in wetlands and alongside bodies of water but can also be constructed in the highlands or even directly on shallow water.
Building structures on pilings is believed to be derived from the design of raised granaries and storehouses, which are highly important status symbols among the ancestrally rice-cultivating Austronesians. The rice granary shrine was also the archetypal religious building among Austronesian cultures and was used to store carvings of ancestor spirits and local deities.
Another common feature are pitched roofs with ornamented gables. The most notable of these are saddlebacked roofs, a design common for longhouses used for village meetings or ceremonies. The overall effect of this is reminiscent of a boat, underlining the strong maritime connections of Austronesian cultures. The boat motif is common throughout, particularly in Eastern Indonesia. In some ethnic groups, the houses are built on platforms that resemble catamarans. Among the Nage people, a woven representation of a boat is added to the ridge of the roof; among the Manggarai people, the roofs of houses are shaped like an upside-down boat; while among the people of Tanimbar and eastern Flores, the ridge itself is carved into a representation of a boat. Furthermore, elements of Austronesian structures (as well as society in general) are often referred to in terminologies used for boats and sailing. These include calling elements of structures "masts", "sails", or "rudders", or calling the village leaders "captains" or "steersmen". In the case of the Philippines, the villages themselves are referred to as "barangay", from an alternate form of "balangay", a type of sailboat used for trading and colonization.
Austronesian buildings have spiritual significance, often containing what has been coined by anthropologist James J. Fox as a "ritual attractor". These are specific posts, beams, platforms, altars, and so on that embody the house as a whole, usually consecrated at the time of building.
The Austronesian house itself also often symbolizes various aspects of indigenous Austronesian cosmology and animism. In the majority of cases, the loft of the house (usually placed above the hearth), is considered to be the domain of deities and spirits. It is essentially a raised granary built into the structure of the house itself and functioning as a second floor. It is commonly used to store sacred objects (like effigies of granary idols or deceased ancestors), heirlooms, and other important objects. These areas are usually not part of the regular living space and may only be accessible to certain members of the family or after performing a specific ritual. Other parts of the house may also be associated with certain deities, and thus certain activities like receiving guests or conducting marriage ceremonies can only be performed in specific areas.
While rice cultivation wasn't among the technologies carried into Remote Oceania, raised storehouses still survived. The "pātaka" of the Māori people is an example. The largest "pātaka" are elaborately adorned with carvings and are often the tallest buildings in the Māori "pā". These were used to store implements, weapons, ships, and other valuables; while smaller "pātaka" were used to store provisions. A special type of "pātaka", supported by a single tall post, also had ritual importance and was used to isolate high-born children during their training for leadership.
The majority of Austronesian structures are not permanent. They are made from perishable materials like wood, bamboo, plant fiber, and leaves. Similar to traditional Austronesian boats, they do not use nails but are traditionally constructed solely by joints, weaving, ties, and dowels. Elements of the structures are repaired and replaced regularly or as they get damaged. Because of this, archaeological records of prehistoric Austronesian structures are usually limited to traces of house posts, with no way of determining the original building plans.
Indirect evidence of traditional Austronesian architecture, however, can be gleaned from their contemporary representations in art, such as friezes on the walls of later Hindu-Buddhist stone temples (like in reliefs at Borobudur and Prambanan). But these are limited to the recent centuries. They can also be reconstructed linguistically from shared terms for architectural elements, like ridge poles, thatch, rafters, house posts, hearths, notched log ladders, storage racks, public buildings, and so on. Linguistic evidence also makes it clear that stilt houses were already present among Austronesian groups since at least the Late Neolithic.
In modern Indonesia, varying styles are collectively known as "rumah adat".
Arbi "et al." (2013) have also noted the striking similarities between Austronesian architecture and Japanese traditional raised architecture ("shinmei-zukuri"). Particularly the buildings of the Ise Grand Shrine, which contrast with the pit-houses typical of the Neolithic Yayoi period. They propose significant Neolithic contact between the people of southern Japan and Austronesians or pre-Austronesians that occurred prior to the spread of Han Chinese cultural influence to the islands. Rice cultivation is also believed to have been introduced to Japan from a para-Austronesian group from coastal eastern China. Waterson (2009) has also argued that the architectural tradition of stilt houses is originally Austronesian and that similar building traditions in Japan and mainland Asia (notably among Kra-Dai and Austroasiatic-speaking groups) correspond to contacts with a prehistoric Austronesian network.
Pottery.
Outside of Taiwan, assemblages of red-slipped pottery, plainware, and incised and stamped pottery associated with Austronesian migrations are first documented from around 2000 to 1800 BCE in the northern Philippines, from sites in the Batanes Islands and the Cagayan Valley of Northern Luzon. From there, pottery technology rapidly spread to the east, south, and southwest.
This type of pottery dispersed south and southwest to the rest of Island Southeast Asia. The eastward and southward branches of the migrations converged in Island Melanesia, resulting in what is now known as the Lapita culture, centered around the Bismarck Archipelago.
The oldest known pottery assemblages in Oceania are circle- and punctate/dentate-stamped pottery in the Marianas Islands, securely dated to 1500 BCE–1300 BCE from multiple archaeological sites. It predates the earliest Lapita culture pottery assemblages (c. 1350 –1300 BCE) and bears closest resemblance to a subset of the more diverse Nagsabaran pottery of the northern Philippines. It is currently disputed whether this is indicative of a direct ancient voyage from the northern Philippines to the Marianas. Hung "et al." (2011) proposed a direct deliberate voyage from eastern Luzon, which would make it the longest sea crossing undertaken by that time in human history. This has also been proposed by earlier authors like Blust (2000) and Reid (2002), based on linguistics.
Winter "et al." (2012), on the other hand, dismissed the similarities as being generic rather than specific to the region. This is from both analysis of the microscopic structure of the shards (indicating manufacturing techniques) and the impossibility of drift voyaging from Luzon, due to the prevailing wind and currents. Instead of a voyage directly from Luzon, they instead proposed an origin either from a direct single voyage from Mindanao (southern Philippines) or Morotai (Maluku Islands) to Guam; or two voyages, with way stations in Palau or Yap.
Hung "et al." (2012) pointed out in response that no pottery assemblages older than 2,000 years old have been found in Morotai, which also has a Papuan-speaking population. They also mentioned that present-day data on wind and currents is not a reliable way of ascertaining migration routes, and that the voyages settling Remote Oceania would have been deliberate, not uncontrolled drifting. Similar presumptions by Thor Heyerdahl led to his erroneous conclusion that Polynesia was settled from the Americas. Pottery manufacturing techniques are also diverse, even within a single community. Thus, analysis of manufacturing methods is less significant than comparison of decorative systems. Nevertheless, Hung "et al." (2012) emphasized that they also did not discount other sources (yet undiscovered) from the southern Philippines. They also proposed the Eastern Visayas as a likely point of origin. Sources south of the Philippines remain unlikely without further archaeological findings due to their related pottery assemblages being younger than 1500 BCE.
The dentate-stamped pottery of the Lapita culture (c. 1350–1300 BCE) retained elements also found in the Nagsabaran pottery in the Philippines, including stamped circles as well as the cross-in-circle motif. They carried pottery technology as far as Tonga in Polynesia. Pottery technology in Tonga, however, became reduced to undecorated plainware within only two centuries before abruptly disappearing completely by around 400 BCE. The reasons for this are still unknown. Pottery was absent in subsequent migrations to the rest of Remote Oceania, being replaced instead with carved wooden or bamboo containers, bottle gourds, and baskets. However, the geometric designs and stylized figures used in the pottery are still present in other surviving art forms, such as tattooing, weaving, and barkcloth patterns.
A common practice among Austronesians in a large area of Island Southeast Asia is the use of burial jars, which emerged during the Late Neolithic and flourished in the first millennium CE. They are characteristic of a region bordered by the Philippines to the north, southern Sumatra in the southwest, and Sumba and the Maluku Islands in the southeast. However, these didn't comprise a single tradition but can be grouped into at least fourteen different traditions scattered across the islands. In most cases, the earliest burial jars used were large indigenous earthenware jars, followed by indigenous or imported stoneware jars ("martaban"), and finally imported porcelain jars acquired from the burgeoning maritime trade with China and Mainland Southeast Asia around the 14th century CE.
Music and dance.
Slit drums are indigenous Austronesian musical instruments invented and used by Southeast Asian-Austronesian and Oceanic-Austronesian ethnic groups.
Gong ensembles are also a common musical heritage of Island Southeast Asia. The casting of gong instruments is believed to have originated from the Bronze Age cultures of Mainland Southeast Asia. It spread to the Austronesian islands initially through trade as prestige goods. However, mainland Asian gongs were never used in ensembles; the innovation of using gong sets is uniquely Austronesian. Gong ensembles are found in western Malayo-Polynesian groups, though they never penetrated much further east. There are roughly two gong ensemble traditions among Austronesians, which also produced gongs in ancient times.
In western Island Southeast Asia, these traditions are collectively known as "gamelan", being centred on the island of Java in Indonesia. They include the "celempung" of the Malay Peninsula, "talempung" of northern Sumatra, "caklempung" of central Sumatra, "chalempung" of southern Sumatra, "bonang" of Java, "kromong" of western Kalimantan, "engkromong" of Sarawak, and "trompong" of western Nusa Tenggara.
In eastern Island Southeast Asia, these traditions are known as "kulintang" and are centred in Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago of the southern Philippines. They include the "kulintangan" of Sabah and Palawan, "kolintang" of northern Sulawesi, "kulintang" of Halmahera and Timor, and "totobuang" of the southern Maluku Islands.
Jade carving.
The ancestral pre-Austronesian Liangzhu culture (3400–2250 BCE) of the Yangtze River delta was one of the ancient centers of Neolithic jade carving. Jade was spread to Taiwan by around 3,000 BCE, then further into the Philippines at 2,000 BCE and Vietnam at 1,800–1,500 BCE. All of them began to produce various tools and ornaments in indigenous jade workshops, including adzes, bracelets, beads, and rings.
The most notable jade products of these regions were the vast amounts of penannular (in the form of an incomplete circle) and double-headed earrings and pendants known as "lingling-o", primarily produced in the Philippines and the Sa Huỳnh culture of Vietnam, mostly with raw jade material sourced from eastern Taiwan. These typically depicted two-headed animals or were ring-shaped with side projections. They were indicative of a very active ancient maritime trading region, known as the Sa Huynh-Kalanay Interaction Sphere, that imported and exported raw jade and finished jade ornaments. They were produced during a period from 500 BCE to as late as 1000 CE, although later examples were replaced with metal, wood, bone, clay, green mica, black nephrite, or shell materials, rather than green jade.
Polished and ground stone adzes, gouges, and other implements, some of which are made from jade-like stone, have also been recorded in areas of Island Melanesia and eastern New Guinea associated with the Lapita culture. These were considered valuable currency and were primarily used to trade for goods. In 2012, a Lapita jadeite gouge used for wood carving was found on Emirau Island in the Bismarck Archipelago. It was dated to around 3,300 BCE, but the origin of the jade material is unknown. Similar stone tools have also been found in New Caledonia.
Jade was absent in most of Remote Oceania, due to the lack of deposits. However, there is putative evidence that Polynesians may have remained familiar with jade and may acquired it through prehistoric trade contacts with New Caledonia, Island Melanesia, and/or New Zealand.
Jade-carving traditions reappeared among the Māori people of New Zealand. These were produced from locally sourced (greenstone) and were used to produce (treasure). They include various tools and weapons like adzes, scrapers, fishing hooks, and , as well as ornaments like the and . Certain ornaments like the (double-headed animal pendant) and the (bird leg ring) bear remarkably strong resemblances to the double-headed and ring-type "linglingo". Bellwood "et al." (2011) has suggested that the reappearance of these motifs might be evidence of a preserved tradition of Southeast Asian jade motifs (perhaps carved in perishable wood, bone, or shell by Polynesians prior to the reacquisition of a jade source), or they might even be the result of later Iron Age contact between eastern Polynesia and the Philippines.
Rock art.
There are approximately six to seven hundred rock art sites discovered in Southeast Asia and Island Melanesia, as well as over eight hundred megalithic sites. The sites specifically associated with the Austronesian expansion contain examples of indigenous pictograms and petroglyphs. Within Southeast Asia, the sites associated with Austronesians can be divided into three general rock art traditions: the Megalithic Culture of Borneo, Sulawesi, and the Greater Sunda Islands; the Austronesian Painting Tradition (APT) of the Lesser Sunda Islands, coastal New Guinea, and Island Melanesia; and the Austronesian Engraving Style (AES) of Papua New Guinea and Island Melanesia. Despite proximity, these traditions can be distinguished readily from the Australo-Melanesian rock art traditions of Australia (except the Torres Strait Islands) as well as the interior highlands of New Guinea, indicating the borders of the extent of the Austronesian expansion.
Dating rock art is difficult, but some of the sites subjected to direct dating pre-date Austronesian arrival, like the Lene Hara paintings of East Timor, which have an age range of 6,300 to 26,000 BP. Conversely, others are more recent and can be dated indirectly by their subjects. The depictions of pottery, ships, and metal objects, for example, put certain rock art sites at a range of 2,000 to 4,000 BP. Some hunter-gatherer groups have also continued to produce rock art well into the present period, as evidenced by their modern subjects.
The Megalithic Culture is mostly limited to western Island Southeast Asia, with the greatest concentration being western Indonesia. While most sites are not dated, the age ranges of dating sites are between the 2nd and 16th centuries CE. They are divided into two phases: The first is an older megalithic tradition associated with the Neolithic Austronesian rectangular axe culture (2,500 to 1,500 BCE), while the second is the 3rd- or 4th-century BCE megalithic tradition associated with the (non-Austronesian) Dong Son culture of Vietnam. Prasetyo (2006) suggests that the megalithic traditions are not originally Austronesian but rather innovations acquired through trade with India and China, but this has little to no evidence in the intervening regions in Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.
The Austronesian Painting Traditions are the most common types of rock art in Island Southeast Asia. They consist of scenes and pictograms typically found in rock shelters and caves near coastal areas. They are characteristically rendered in red ocher pigments for the earlier forms, later sometimes superseded by paintings done in black charcoal pigments. Their sites are mostly clustered in Eastern Indonesia and Island Melanesia, although a few examples can be found in the rest of Island Southeast Asia. Their occurrence has a high correlation to Austronesian-speaking areas, further evidenced by the appearance of bronze artifacts in the paintings. They are mostly found near the coastlines. Their common motifs include hand stencils, "sun-ray" designs, boats, and active human figures with headdresses or weapons and other paraphernalia. They also feature geometric motifs similar to those of the Austronesian Engraving Style. Some paintings are also associated with traces of human burials and funerary rites, including ship burials. The representations of boats themselves are believed to be connected to the widespread "ship of the dead" Austronesian funerary practices.
The earliest APT site dated is from Vanuatu and was found to be around 3,000 BP, corresponding to the initial migration wave of the Austronesians. These early sites are largely characterized by face motifs and hand stencils. Later sites, from 1,500 BP onwards, however, begin to show regional divergence in their art styles. APT can be readily distinguished from older Pleistocene-era Australo-Melanesian cave paintings by their motifs, color, and composition, though they can often be found in the same locality. The most recognizable motifs of APT (like boats) do not occur in cave paintings (or engravings) that definitely pre-date the Austronesian arrival—the sole exception being the stenciled hand motif. Some APT examples are also characteristically found in relatively inaccessible locations, including very high up in cliffsides overlooking the sea. No traces of APT have been found in Taiwan or the Philippines, though there is continuity in the motifs of spirals and concentric circles found in ancestral petroglyphs.
AES, which consists of petroglyphs carved into rock surfaces, is far less common than APT. The majority of these sites are in coastal New Guinea and Island Melanesia. AES sites, which can be tentatively traced back to the similar Wanshan petroglyphs of Taiwan, are believed to be largely correlated to the prehistoric extent of the Lapita culture. The common motif of this tradition is curvilinear geometric engravings like spirals, concentric circles, and face-like forms. These resemble the geometric motifs in APT, though they are considered to be two separate artistic traditions. AES is particularly dominant in the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia, where engravings are far more abundant than painted sites.
O'Connor "et al." (2015) proposes that APT developed during the initial rapid southward Austronesian expansion, and not before, possibly as a response to the communication challenges brought about by the new maritime mode of living. Along with AES, these material symbols and associated rituals and technologies may have been manifestations of "powerful ideologies" spread by Austronesian settlers that were central to the "Neolithization" and rapid assimilation of the various non-Austronesian indigenous populations of ISEA and Melanesia.
The easternmost islands of Island Melanesia (Vanuatu, Fiji, and New Caledonia) are considered part of Remote Oceania, as they are beyond the inter-island visibility threshold. These island groups begin to show divergence from the APT and AES traditions of Near Oceania. While their art traditions show a clear continuation of the APT and AES traditions, they also feature innovations unique to each island group, like the increasing use of black charcoal, rectilinear motifs, and being more commonly found inside sacred caves rather than on open cliffsides.
In Micronesia, the rock art traditions can be divided into three general regions: western, central, and eastern. The divisions reflect the various major migration waves from the Philippines into the Mariana Islands and Palau in 3,500 BP; a Lapita culture back-migration from Island Melanesia into central and eastern Micronesia around 2,200 BP; and finally, a back-migration from western Polynesia into eastern Micronesia around 1,000 BP.
In western Micronesia (Palau, Yap, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands), rock art primarily consists of paintings on high cave ceilings and sea-facing cliffs. It is very similar to APT in terms of its motifs as well as its placement in relatively inaccessible locations. Common motifs include hand stencils, faces, turtles and fish, concentric circles, and characteristic four-pointed stars. Petroglyphs are rare and mainly consist of human forms with triangular bodies without heads or arms. This is believed to be connected to the funerary rite of removing the heads from the bodies of deceased relatives. A notable megalithic tradition in western Micronesia are the "haligi" stone pillars of the Chamorro people. These are capped stone pillars that are believed to have served as supports for raised buildings. They are associated with the Latte period (900 to 1700 CE), when a new wave of migrants from Southeast Asia reintroduced rice cultivation to the islands. Another megalithic tradition is that of the rai stones, massive doughnut-shaped discs of rock that were used as currency on Yap.
Rock art in central Micronesia (Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae), in contrast, is dominated by rock engravings with motifs tying it to the rock art traditions of Island Melanesia. They include curvilinear shapes like spirals and concentric circles, tree-like shapes, and the distinctive "enveloped cross" motif. The Pohnpaid petroglyphs are the largest assemblage of rock engravings in the region, with motifs dominated by footprints, enveloped crosses, and outlined "sword-paddles". Central Micronesia also hosts the ruins of the stone cities of Nan Madol (1,180–1,200 CE) and Leluh (1,200–1,800 CE), on the islands of Pohnpei and Kosrae, respectively.
In the low-lying atolls of eastern Micronesia, rock art is rare-to-nonexistent, due to the absence of suitable rock surfaces for painting or engraving.
In Polynesia, rock art is dominated by petroglyphs, rather than paintings, and they show less variation than the rock art of Near Oceania and ISEA. In the western Polynesian islands nearest to Island Melanesia, rock art is rare (like in Tonga and Samoa) or absent entirely (like in the Cook Islands). However, petroglyphs are abundant on the islands in the further reaches of the Polynesian triangle, particularly on Hawaii, the Marquesas, and Rapa Nui. Rapa Nui has the densest concentration of engravings in Polynesia as a whole, while the Puuloa petroglyphs site on Hawaii has the largest number of petroglyphs in a single site, at over 21,000 engravings. Polynesia also features megalithic sacred ceremonial centers generally known as "marae".
On Tonga and Samoa, the existing rock art sites consist mostly of engravings with motifs including curvilinear shapes, human figures, "jellyfish", turtles, birds, and footprints. These are typically carved in natural rock formations or "marae" sites.
In the central-eastern Polynesian islands, which include the Marquesas and the Society Islands, petroglyphs are more numerous. They show the archetypal Polynesian motifs of turtles, faces, cup-like depressions (cupules), stick-like human figures, boats, fish, curvilinear shapes, and concentric circles. Like in western Polynesia, they are typically carved into "marae" sites or in rocks beside streams. The existing rock paintings also display the same motifs but are rendered in different styles.
On the Hawaiian islands, the abundant petroglyphs are remarkably all similar in execution. Their common subjects include stick-like human figures, dogs, boats, sails, paddles, footprints, and ceremonial headdresses. Depictions of marine life, however, are rare, unlike in the rest of Polynesia. They are typically carved into boulders, lava rock formations, and cliffsides. Red paintings of dogs on cliffsides and caves can also be found on Kauai and Maui. The megalithic traditions of Hawaii can be exemplified by the "heiau" sacred sites, which can range from simple earth terraces to standing stones.
On Rapa Nui, the engravings are distinctive but still show similarities to the techniques and motifs of the Marquesas. Their motifs commonly include disembodied parts of the human body (vulvae in particular), animals, plants, ceremonial objects, and boats. A prominent motif is also that of the "birdman" figure, which is associated with the "tangata manu" cult of Makemake. The best-known rock art assemblage of Rapa Nui, however, are the "moai" megaliths. A few paintings, mostly of birds and boats, have also been discovered, which are associated with the engravings, rather than being separate artforms.
The rock art in New Zealand can be divided into two regions. North Island features more engravings than paintings, while South Island is unique in that it is the only Polynesian island where there are more paintings than engravings. New Zealand rock paintings are done in red and black pigments and can sometimes be found at inaccessible heights. They typically depict human figures (particularly a front-facing human figure with flexed arms), birds, lizards, dogs, fish, and what has been identified as "birdmen". Engravings in open spaces like cliffsides are generally of spirals and curvilinear shapes, while engravings in enclosed caves and shelters depict faces and boats. The same motifs can also be seen in dendroglyphs on living trees.
Body art.
Body art among Austronesian peoples is common, especially elaborate tattooing, which is one of the most well-known pan-Austronesian traditions.
Tattooing.
In modern times, tattoos are usually associated with Polynesian culture, due to the highly influential accounts of James Cook in his explorations of the Pacific in the 18th century. Cook introduced the word "tattoo" (archaic: "tattaow", "tattow") into the English vocabulary from Tahitian and Samoan "tātau" ("to tap"). However, tattoos existed prominently in various other Austronesian groups prior to contact with other cultures.
Tattoos had various functions among Austronesian societies. Among men, they were strongly linked to the widespread practice of head-hunting raids. In head-hunting societies, tattoos were records of how many heads the warrior had taken in battle, and they were part of the initiation rites into adulthood. The number and location of tattoos, therefore, were indicative of a warrior's status and prowess.
Among the Indigenous Taiwanese, tattoos were present for both men and women. Among the Atayal, facial tattoos were dominant. They indicated maturity and skill in weaving and farming for women and skill in hunting and battle for men. As in most of Austronesia, tattooing traditions in Taiwan have largely disappeared due to the Sinicization of native peoples after the Chinese colonization of the island in the 17th century, as well as conversion to Christianity. Most of the remaining tattoos are only found among elders.
One of the earliest descriptions of Austronesian tattoos by Europeans was during the 16th-century Spanish expeditions to the Philippines, beginning with the first voyage of circumnavigation by Ferdinand Magellan. The Spanish encountered the heavily tattooed Visayan people in the Visayas Islands, whom they named the "Pintados" (Spanish for "the painted ones"). However, Philippine tattooing traditions ("batok") have mostly been lost as the natives of the islands converted to Christianity and Islam, though they are still practiced in isolated groups in the highlands of Luzon and Mindanao. Philippine tattoos were usually geometric patterns or stylized depictions of animals, plants, and human figures. Some of the few remaining traditional tattoos in the Philippines are among elders of the Igorot peoples. Most of these were records of war exploits against the Japanese during World War II.
Among the Māori of New Zealand, tattoos ("moko") were originally carved into the skin using bone chisels ("uhi") rather than through puncturing, as in usual practice. In addition to being pigmented, the skin was also left raised into ridges of swirling patterns.
Dental modification.
Teeth blackening was the custom of dyeing one's teeth black with various tannin-rich plant dyes. It was practiced throughout almost the entire range of Austronesia, including Island Southeast Asia, Madagascar, Micronesia, and Island Melanesia, reaching as far east as Malaita. However, it was absent in Polynesia. It also existed in non-Austronesian populations in Mainland Southeast Asia and Japan. The practice was primarily preventative, as it reduced the chances of developing tooth decay, similar to modern dental sealants. It also had cultural significance and was seen as beautiful. A common sentiment was that blackened teeth separated humans from animals.
Teeth blackening was often done in conjunction with other modifications to the teeth associated with beauty standards, including dental evulsion and filing.
Religion.
The religious traditions of the Austronesian people focus mostly on ancestral spirits, nature spirits, and gods, making it a complex animistic religion. Mythologies vary by culture and geographical location but share common basic aspects, such as ancestor worship, animism, shamanism, and the belief in a spirit world and powerful deities. There is also a great amount of shared mythology and a common belief in Mana.
Many of these beliefs have gradually been replaced. Examples of native religions include: Indigenous Philippine folk religions (including beliefs in Anito), Sunda Wiwitan, Kejawen, Kaharingan, and Māori religion. Many Austronesian religious beliefs have been incorporated into foreign religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam, which Austronesian peoples were introduced to later.
Writing.
With the possible exception of rongorongo on Rapa Nui, Austronesians did not have an indigenous writing system but rather adopted or developed writing systems after contact with various non-Austronesian cultures. There existed various forms of symbolic communication using pictograms and petroglyphs, but these did not encode language.
Rongorongo, said to have originally been called "kohau motu mo rongorongo" ("lines of inscriptions for chanting out"), is the only pre-contact indigenous Austronesian system of glyphs that appear to be true writing or at least proto-writing. They consist of around 120 glyphs, ranging from representations of plants to animals, celestial objects, and geometric shapes. They were inscribed into wooden tablets about long using shark teeth and obsidian flakes. The wood allegedly came from toromiro and makoi trees, which is notable given that Rapa Nui was completely deforested at the time of European contact. Of the surviving two dozen tablets, a few were made from trees introduced after European contact, as well as wood originating from European ships and driftwood. Rapa Nui also has a rich assemblage of petroglyphs largely associated with the "tangata manu" ("birdman") cult of Makemake. Although some rongorongo glyphs may have been derived from these petroglyphs, rongorongo does not appear in any of the abundant rock carvings in Rapa Nui and seems to be restricted to the wooden tablets.
The tablets were first described by an outsider in 1864 by the Catholic missionary Eugène Eyraud, who said they were found "in all the houses". However, he paid them little attention, and they remained unnoticed by the outside world. It wasn't until 1869 that one of the tablets came into the possession of Florentin-Étienne Jaussen, the Bishop of Tahiti. He brought the tablets to the world's attention and instructed the Rapa Nui mission to gather more information about them. But by then, most of the tablets were allegedly already destroyed, presumed to have been used as fuel by the natives on the deforested island.
At the time of discovery of the tablets, Rapa Nui had undergone severe depopulation. This was largely due to the loss of the island's last trees and the Peruvian and Chilean slave raids in the early 1860s. The literate ruling classes of the Rapa Nui people (including the royal family and the religious caste) and the majority of the island's population were kidnapped or killed in the slave raids. Most of those taken died after only one or two years in captivity from harsh working conditions and European diseases. Succeeding epidemics of smallpox and tuberculosis further decimated the island's population to the point that there were not enough people to bury the dead. The last remnants of the Rapa Nui people were assimilated by the Tahitians who were later brought to the island in an effort to repopulate it, further resulting in the loss of most of the Old Rapa Nui language.
Oral tradition holds that the ruling classes were the only ones who could read the tablets, and the ability to decipher the tablets was lost along with them. Numerous attempts have been made to read the tablets, starting from a few years after their discovery. But to this day, none have proven successful. Some authors have proposed that rongorongo may have been an attempt to imitate European script after the idea of writing was introduced during the "signing" of the 1770 Spanish Treaty of Annexation or through knowledge of European writing acquired elsewhere. They cite various reasons, including the lack of attestation of rongorongo prior to the 1860s, the clearly more recent provenance of some of the tablets, the lack of antecedents, and the lack of additional archaeological evidence since its discovery. Others argue that it was merely a mnemonic list of symbols meant to guide incantations. Whether rongorongo is merely an example of trans-cultural diffusion or a true indigenous Austronesian writing system (and one of the few independent inventions of writing in human history) remains unknown.
In Southeast Asia, the first true writing systems of pre-modern Austronesian cultures were all derived from the Grantha and Pallava Brahmic scripts, all of which are abugidas from South India. Various forms of abugidas spread throughout Austronesian cultures in Southeast Asia as kingdoms became Indianized through early maritime trading. The oldest use of abugida scripts in Austronesian cultures are 4th-century stone inscriptions written in Cham, from Vietnam. There are numerous other Brahmic-derived writing systems among Southeast Asian Austronesians, usually specific to a certain ethnic group. Notable examples include Balinese, Batak, Baybayin, Buhid, Hanunó'o, Javanese, Kulitan, Lontara, Old Kawi, Rejang, Rencong, Sundanese, and Tagbanwa. They vary from having letters with rounded shapes to characters with sharp cuneiform-like angles, as a result of the difference in writing mediums, with the former being ideal for writing on soft leaves and the latter on bamboo panels. The use of the scripts ranged from mundane records to encoding esoteric knowledge on magico-religious rituals and folk medicine.
In regions that converted to Islam, abjads derived from the Arabic script started replacing the earlier abugidas at around the 13th century in Southeast Asia. Madagascar adopted the Arabic script in the 14th century. Abjads, however, have an even greater inherent problem with encoding Austronesian languages than abugidas, because Austronesian languages have more varied and salient vowels that the Arabic script usually cannot encode. As a result, the Austronesian adaptations such as the Jawi and the Pegon scripts have been modified with a system of diacritics that encode sounds, both vowels and consonants, native to Austronesian languages but absent in Semitic ones. With the advent of the Colonial Era, almost all of these writing systems have been replaced with alphabets adapted from the Latin, as in the Hawaiian, Filipino, and Malay alphabet. However, several Formosan languages had been written in zhuyin, and Cia-Cia off Sulawesi has experimented with hangul.
On Woleai and surrounding islands, a script was developed for the Woleaian language in the early 20th century. Approximately 20% of the script's letterforms were borrowed from Latin letters; the remaining characters seem to have been derived from indigenous iconography. Despite this heavy Latin influence, the script was a syllabary.
Vanuatu has a unique tradition of sand drawing, in which images are created by a single continuous line drawn in the sand. It is believed to have functioned as a means of symbolic communication in pre-contact Island Melanesia, especially between travelers and ethnic groups that do not speak the same language. The sand drawings consist of around 300 different designs and seem to be shared across language groups. In the 1990s, elements of the drawings were adapted into a modern constructed script called Avoiuli by the Turaga indigenous movement on Pentecost Island.
Genetic studies.
Genetic studies have been conducted on Austronesian peoples. Haplogroup O1a, marked by the M119 SNP, is frequently detected in native Taiwanese and northern Filipinos, as well as some people in Indonesia, Malaysia, and non-Austronesian populations in southern China.
A 2007 analysis of the DNA recovered from human remains in archaeological sites of prehistoric peoples along the Yangtze River in China also shows high frequencies of Haplogroup O1 in the Neolithic Liangzhu culture, linking them to Austronesian and Tai-Kadai peoples. The Liangzhu culture existed in coastal areas around the mouth of the Yangtze. Haplogroup O1 was absent in other archaeological sites inland. The authors of the study suggest that this may be evidence of two different human migration routes during the peopling of Eastern Asia; one coastal and the other inland, with little gene flow between them.
The 'core Austronesian' population derives more ancestry from Late Neolithic Fujian-related sources (66.9%–74.3%), similar to present Kra-Dai groups and southeastern Han Chinese. Strong affinities also exist between present Austronesians and Qihe3 from Early Neolithic Fujian. Qihe3 clusters with Boshan from Early Neolithic Shandong and is genetically indistinguishable from Liangdao-2. However, Qihe3 could be modeled as a mixture of coastal Neolithic East Asian ancestries (e.g. Boshan, Liangdao) and deeply diverging East Asian ancestry (e.g. Longlin, IndusPeriphery) although this 2-way model is not a better fit than the 1-way model. They could also be modeled as a mixture of Longlin/Dushan-related and Tianyuan-related ancestries and in some cases, a mixture of Longlin and Dushan-related ancestries. In contrast, Late Neolithic Fujianese populations, like Xitoucun and Tanshishan, have higher affinities with Dushan-related populations. The Taiwan Hanben population is also closely related to Dushan-related populations, who in turn are related to the Taiwan Gongguan population, Longli Bouyei and Qiandongnan Dong, who are representatives of the ancestral Kra-Dai population, Kinh Vietnamese etc. Another study states affirms the southeastern Chinese origins of the 'proto-Austronesian' population although there's evidence that they mixed with contemporary populations from Shandong. 
An important breakthrough in studies in Austronesian genetics was the identification of the "Polynesian motif" (haplogroup B4a1a1) in 1989, a specific nine-base-pair deletion mutation in mitochondrial DNA. Several studies have shown that it is shared by Polynesians and Island Southeast Asians, with a sub-branch also identified in Madagascar, indicating shared maternal ancestry among Austronesians. Austronesian-speaking regions also have high-to-moderate frequencies of haplogroup O1 of the Y-DNA (including Madagascar), indicating shared paternal ancestry, with the exception of Polynesia where the Papuan-derived haplogroup C2a1 predominates (although lower frequencies of Austronesian haplogroup O-M122 also exist). This indicates that the Lapita people, the direct ancestors of Polynesians, were likely matrilocal, assimilating Papuan men from outside the community by marriage in Near Oceania, prior to the Polynesian expansion into Remote Oceania.
Moodley "et al." (2009) identified two distinct populations of the gut bacteria "Helicobacter pylori" that accompanied human migrations into Island Southeast Asia and Oceania, called hpSahul and hspMāori. The study sampled Native Australians, Native Taiwanese, highlanders in New Guinea, and Melanesians and Polynesians in New Caledonia, which were then compared with other "H. pylori" haplotypes from Europeans, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and others. They found that hpSahul diverged from mainland Asian "H. pylori" populations approximately 31,000 to 37,000 years ago and have remained isolated for 23,000 to 32,000 years, confirming the Australo-Melanesian substratum in Island Southeast Asia and New Guinea. hspMāori, on the other hand, is a subpopulation of hpEastAsia, previously isolated from Polynesians (Māori, Tongans, Samoans) in New Zealand, and three individuals from the Philippines and Japan. The study found hspMāori from Native Taiwanese, Melanesians, Polynesians, and two inhabitants from the Torres Strait Islands, all of which are Austronesian sources. As expected, hspMāori showed greatest genetic diversity in Taiwan, while all non-Taiwanese hspMāori populations belonged to a single lineage they called the "Pacific clade". They also calculated the isolation-with-migration model (IMa), which showed that the divergence of the Pacific clade of hspMāori was unidirectional from Taiwan to the Pacific. This is consistent with the Out-of-Taiwan model of Austronesian expansion.
A 2014 study states that Austronesian populations from Island Southeast Asia and Oceania, such as Fiji and Polynesia, have 30-90% Taiwan-related ancestry. Populations from western Island Southeast Asia have ~10–60% H’tin-related ancestry, with the rest being Taiwan-related and Negrito-related. In contrast, there is no Taiwan-related ancestry in admixed Mainland Southeast Asian populations that don't traditionally speak Austronesian languages.
On 16 January 2020, the personal genomics company 23andMe added the category "Filipino &amp; Austronesian" after customers with no known Filipino ancestors were getting false positives for 5% or more "Filipino" ancestry in their ancestry composition report (the proportion was as high as 75% in Samoa, 71% in Tonga, 68% in Guam, 18% in Hawaii, and 34% in Madagascar). The company's scientists surmised that this was due to the shared Austronesian genetic heritage being incorrectly identified as Filipino ancestry.
According to a 2021 study, Cordillerans are the least admixed Austronesian group among the Austronesians of East Asia, especially Kankanaey, Bontoc, Balangao, Tuwali, Ayangan, Kalanguya, and Ibaloi groups. Compared to Austronesians like Ami and Atayal, they do not exhibit admixture with Austroasiatic-related and Northeast Asian-related groups. All Filipino subgroups likewise show closer affinities to Cordillerans than Ami and Atayal. Nonetheless, Ami, Atayal and Cordillerans all share strong affinities with Malaysians, Indonesians, Oceanians and even ancient individuals from peninsular Malaysia and Oceanian Lapita. Cordillerans are also closely related to the ~7,000 to 8,000-y-old Liangdao-2 individual and did not receive the northern East Asian ancestry that was introduced in this individual. Compared to other Filipino subgroups, Central Cordillerans show no admixture with indigenous Negritos despite extensive interaction with their neighbors. However, there's evidence of northern East Asian ancestry being introduced to the Batanes Islands and coastal regions of Luzon after the initial Cordilleran settlement of the Philippines from Taiwan. Likewise, there's evidence of low-lying European ancestry in individuals from Bolinao, Cebuano, Ibaloi, Itabayaten, Ilocano, Ivatan, Kapampangan, Pangasinan, and Yogad groups, along with some urbanized lowlanders, Bicolanos and Spanish Creole-speaking Chavacanos, dating back to the Spanish colonial period.
A 2023 study, however, states that present Kankanaey groups have about ∼33% northern East Asian ancestry, similar to what's found in Taiwan Highland/Taiwan Orchid Island groups, who have ∼28–37% northern East Asian ancestry. These findings suggest considerable northern East Asian influence in Taiwan prior to the Out-of-Taiwan expansions. For example, other early Out-of-Taiwan (i.e. Lapita) groups have more northern East Asian ancestry than Into-Taiwan groups (∼21–29% vs. ∼0–8%). 
Austronesian-related populations also partially contributed to the genomes of Jōmon peoples and Koreans. However, the affinities between Austronesians and Jōmon more likely reflect shared descent from a population that expanded from south to north in East Asia during its initial settlement. Inland and coastal routes were taken although genetic components of the former were erased by extensive back-migrations.
Evidence from agriculture.
The Austronesian migrations were accompanied by a set of domesticated, semi-domesticated, and commensal plants and animals transported via outrigger ships and catamarans that enabled early Austronesians to thrive in their mostly island environments. These include crops and animals believed to have originated from the Hemudu and Majiabang cultures in the hypothetical pre-Austronesian homelands in mainland China, as well as other plants and animals believed to have been first domesticated from within Taiwan, Maritime Southeast Asia, and New Guinea. Some of these plants are sometimes also known as "canoe plants", especially in the context of Polynesian migrations. They provide another source of evidence for Austronesian population movements.
Notable examples of these crops include coconuts, bananas, rice, sugarcane, paper mulberry (tapa tree), breadfruit, taro, ube, areca nut (including the practice of betel chewing), ginger, turmeric, candlenut, pandan, and citruses. The cultivation of sweet potatoes in Polynesia may also be evidence of prehistoric Austronesian contact with the Americas, though this remains disputed. The domesticated animals carried in Austronesian voyages include dogs, pigs, and chickens.
Austronesians also introduced these crops and domesticated animals westward via trade links. Island Southeast Asians established spice trade links with the Dravidian-speaking regions in Sri Lanka and Southern India by around 1500 to 600 BCE. These early contacts resulted in the introduction of Austronesian crops and material culture to South Asia, including betel nut chewing, coconuts, sandalwood, domesticated bananas, sugarcane, cloves, and nutmeg. South Asian crops like the mung bean and horsegram were also present in Southeast Asia by 400–100 BCE, indicating the exchange was reciprocal.
There is also indirect evidence of very early Austronesian contacts with Africa, based on the presence and spread of Austronesian domesticates like bananas, taro, chickens, and purple yam in Africa in the first millennium BCE.
Pre-Columbian contact with the Americas.
A genomic analysis in 2020 showed Austronesian contact with South America around 1150–1200 CE, the earliest one being between Fatu Hiva and Colombia.

Zoo Friends

Zoo Friends provides assistance to Sydney's Taronga Zoo and Dubbo's Western Plains Zoo as a not-for-profit organisation. Over two million dollars were raised in 2005 in support of the Zoos and conservation and education strategies. In 2009, the total membership of the Association of Zoo Friends was over 62,000.
Started in 1983 with the goal to provide financial and volunteer help to both Taronga and Western Plains Zoos, Zoo Friends has a governing body with elected and appointed members. Elections are held annually, and all adult financial members are eligible to vote and to run for office.
Funds are raised by membership subscriptions and educational activities. Zoo Friends membership subscriptions contribute to zoological conservation and education projects. Fifty per cent of membership subscription fees goes automatically to Taronga and Western Plains Zoo. This amounted to $1.3 million in 2008. In addition to this fifty percent, $10.00 of every subscription also goes directly to the Taronga Foundation in support of the Zoological Parks Board's master plan.
The remainder of subscription monies, after operating expenses are met, is returned to the zoos in the form of grants for the Zoos' conservation and educational projects. They can vary from funding for new animal enclosures, animal enrichment equipment and projects to Zoo Friends' fellowships. Zoo Friends have donated over $13 million.
Zoo Friends has over 460 volunteers at both Taronga and Western Plains Zoos. They give over 60,000 hours of dedicated service each year. This represents an estimated yearly contribution of $1.8 million based on average employment costs. Volunteers help the zoos in a wide variety of areas, including service providers and educational facilitators.

Grevillea triloba

Grevillea triloba is species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae and is endemic to near Geraldton in Western Australia. It is a diffuse or spreading shrub, usually with divided leaves with 3 spreading, linear lobes, and clusters of white flowers.
Description.
"Grevillea triloba"is a diffuse or spreading shrub that typically grows to a height of , its branchlets woolly- to shaggy-hairy. The leaves are usually divided, long, usually with 3 spreading lobes long, wide. Sometimes the leaves are broadly linear and wide. The edges of the leaves are turned down to rolled under without concealing the woolly-hairy lower surface. The flowers are arranged in conical to more or less cylindrical clusters on a woolly-hairy rachis, the flowers nearer the base of the rachis flowering first. The flowers are white or pinkish, the pistil long. Flowering mainly occurs from July to October, and the fruit is an oblong to elliptic follicle long with a wrinkled surface.
Taxonomy.
"Grevillea triloba" was first formally described by the botanist Carl Meissner in 1855 in William Jackson Hooker's "Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany" from specimens collected by James Drummond.
The specific epithet ("triloba") means "three-lobed", referring to the leaves.
Distribution.
This grevillea grows in heath and shrubby woodland in sandy loam or lateritic soils in near-coastal areas from Geraldton to near Northampton in the Geraldton Sandplains bioregion of Western Australia.
Conservation status.
"Grevillea triloba" is listed as "Priority Three" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.
Use in horticulture.
Commonly cultivated, "G. triloba" is a vigorous plant that is suited to most soils and aspects. The prickly leaves make it suitable as a screening plant.

Legislative district of Malabon–Navotas

The Legislative district of Malabon–Navotas was the combined representation of the Metropolitan Manila municipalities (now highly urbanized cities) of Malabon and Navotas in the lower house of the Congress of the Philippines from 1987 to 2010.
Since 2010, each has been represented separately through the lone congressional districts of Malabon and Navotas.
History.
Prior to gaining joint representation, areas now under the respective jurisdictions of Malabon and Navotas were represented under Rizal (1907–1972), Region IV (1978–1984), and the parliamentary district of Malabon–Navotas–Valenzuela (1984–1986).
Under the new Constitution which was proclaimed on 11 February 1987, the independent Metro Manila municipalities of Malabon and Navotas constituted a single congressional district, and elected its member to the restored House of Representatives starting that same year.
The enactment of Republic Act No. 9387 on 10 March 2007 and its subsequent approval by plebiscite on 24 June 2007 converted Navotas into a highly urbanized city. Per Section 58 of R.A. 9387 Navotas was constituted into its own congressional district, which effectively created separate representation for Malabon as well. Both cities elected their separate representatives in the 2010 elections.

Wet Moor () is a 491.0-hectare (1214.0 acre) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest east of Muchelney in Somerset, notified in 1985.
Wet Moor is part of the extensive grazing marsh grasslands and ditch systems of the Somerset Levels and Moors.
Wet Moor is low-lying, low-relief land typical in character of the Somerset Moors and Levels. The landscape is dominated by two major arterial watercourses, the Rivers Parrett and Yeo. These are large embanked channels which act as upland water carriers conveying water from the upstream catchments through the low moor lands. In storm conditions the rivers can surcharge their banks and overspill into the adjacent low-lying moorland. Here, flood waters are retained until river levels recede below bankfull conditions. The rivers running through the moor make home for many wildlife, including wintering whooper swans.

C4 (conference)

C4 was a Macintosh software developers conference held in Chicago, Illinois. The conference ran from 2006 through 2009. It was created by Jonathan Rentzsch after the demise of MacHack. In May 2010 Rentzsch announced that he would no longer operate the conference due to a dissatisfaction with Apple's policies toward iPhone OS development and the lack of a strong negative reaction from the Apple developer community.
Etymology.
The name C4 stands for Code Culture Conspiracy Conference
C4[0].
The first C4 conference was a two-day event held at the University Center in downtown Chicago. It was held on October 20 and October 21, 2006, with an optional trip to Adler Planetarium's TimeSpace show for attendees on October 22. Due to that year's Chicago Marathon, attendees unable to stay downtown were provided free passes to the Chicago 'L' railway system for the weekend (an arrangement referred to as "Plan 'L'").

<doc id="6911611" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6911611" title="Grevillea aquifolium">
Grevillea aquifolium

Grevillea aquifolium is a shrubby or scrambling plant endemic to South Australia and Victoria. Common names include holly grevillea, prickly grevillea or variable prickly grevillea. It occurs naturally in woodland, open forest and heathland.
Description.
The species displays a high level of plasticity in its leaves, habit, and habitat preferences across its natural range. The height of the shrubby forms usually ranges between 1 and 2 metres but can reach 4 metres in some populations, while prostrate forms are also observed in their natural distribution, sometimes growing among shrubby forms. The flowers occur in terminal one-sided racemes, typical of what are commonly referred to as "toothbrush" grevilleas. They are red or occasionally yellowish-green. Flowering in South Australia is recorded as being between November and March, while in the Grampians in Victoria it extends from September to April. The foliage is usually lobed with sharp points on the lobes but some populations have leaves with nearly entire leaf margins.
Taxonomy.
The species was formally described in 1838 by English botanist John Lindley in "Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia" based on plant material collected from Mount William in the Grampians by Thomas Mitchell. Mitchell commented that the species was "a remarkable kind with leaves like those of a European holly, but downy". The specific epithet ("aquifolium") is a reference to the common European holly, "Ilex aquifolium". 
Distribution and habitat.
"Grevillea aquifolium" occurs in the south-east of South Australia and western Victoria.
In South Australia, small populations are found at locations such as Carpenter Rocks, Bucks Lake Game Reserve and West Dairy Range. In Victoria the species is found in the Grampians region and northwards to the Little Desert as well as near the south coast at Kentbruck Heath near Portland. Associated tree species in Victoria include "Eucalyptus baxteri", "Eucalyptus obliqua", "Eucalyptus willisii" subsp. "falciformis" and "Callitris rhomboidea".
Possible hybrids between this species and "Grevillea microstegia" and "Grevillea montis-cole" occur near Mount Cassel and Mount William respectively.
Ecology.
Birds are thought to be the primary pollinators of the species, though bees and ants may also have a role.
Conservation status.
"Grevillea aquifolium" is listed as "Least Concern" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This species has a wide distribution where it is locally common, and its population is presumed to be large and stable. Overall, there are no known major threats to this species, however, it is considered to be moderately susceptible to infection by the pathogen "Phytophthora cinnamomi."
Use in horticulture.
A number of naturally occurring forms have been brought into cultivation from locations including Carpenter Rocks, Cooack, Halls Gap, Kenbruck Heath, Lake Wartook, Little Desert, Mount William and Serra Road.
'Copper Crest', a hybrid cross of "G. aquifolium" and "G.acanthifolia", is a commercially released cultivar that was selected in Montrose in Victoria in 1975.
"Grevillea aquifolium" prefers a well-drained position with full exposure to the sun or in partial shade. Mature plants are drought tolerant and have some frost tolerance, but dislike humidity. Plants may be propagated from cuttings taken from semi-mature growth.

Eternal leaders of North Korea

The eternal leaders of North Korea (officially the eternal leaders of "Juche" Korea) are titles accorded to deceased leaders of North Korea. The phrase was used in a line of the preamble to the Constitution, as amended on 30 June 2016, and in subsequent revisions.
It reads (in the original version):
History of the title.
Presidency of North Korea before 1994.
The post of "President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" was established in the Constitution of North Korea in 1972. Until then, Kim Il Sung held the posts of premier and general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea.
In 1972, the presidency was established, and Kim Il Sung was elected to the position by the Supreme People's Assembly, the North Korean legislature, on 28 December 1972. Kim served as president until 1994 when he died, and the position was left vacant and his son and successor Kim Jong Il was not given the title.
"Eternal President".
The preamble of the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as amended on 5 September 1998 reads:
The president was the "de jure" head of state of North Korea, but whose powers were exercised by the "sacred leader" of the nation's state ideology called "Juche". According to Ashley J. Tellis and Michael Wills, this amendment to the preamble was an indication of the unique North Korean characteristic of being a theocratic state based on the personality cult surrounding Kim Il Sung. In addition, North Korea adopted a Juche calendar dating from 1912, the year of Kim Il Sung's birth.
The 2012 constitution once again referred to Kim Il Sung as the "Eternal President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea".
"Eternal General Secretary" / "Eternal Chairman".
After the death of Kim Jong Il, the constitution was amended in 2012, declaring him Eternal General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission.
In 2016, the title "eternal leaders of Juche Korea" was introduced by amending the preamble of the constitution, and it was given to Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.
Head of state role in North Korea after the deaths of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.
The functions and powers previously belonging to the president were divided between numerous officials: the premier of North Korea; the chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly; and the head of the military, the chairman of the National Defence Commission (replaced by State Affairs Commission of North Korea in 2016) and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army. These positions are currently held by Pak Thae-song, Choe Ryong-hae, and Kim Jong Un respectively.

<doc id="6911644" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6911644" title="Namdaemun Market">
Namdaemun Market

Namdaemun Market () is a large traditional market in Seoul, South Korea. It is located next to Namdaemun, the main southern gate to the old city. The market is among the oldest extant markets in Korea, having opened during the Joseon period in 1414.
The market's character, location, and size have all changed over time. Amidst Joseon's isolationism in the 16th and 17th centuries, the market was limited to mostly Korean customers and merchants. This persisted until the Empire of Japan forcefully opened Korea in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876. Afterwards, nearly half of the merchants became either ethnic Chinese or Japanese merchants. During the 1910–1945 Japanese colonial period, the market survived a number of attempts by the Japanese colonial government to shut it down. The market was destroyed a number of times over time by accidental fires, including one during the 1950–1953 Korean War. Each time it was destroyed, it was rebuilt to roughly the same size and status it had previously operated under.
Today the market has been modernized, although it retains much of its bustling character. It is largely jointly owned by a collective of the merchants who operate within it. According to the Seoul Institute, it contained 5,200 stores, had 9,090 workers, and had an area of .
History.
Creation of the market.
In 1394, shortly after the establishment of the Joseon dynasty, King Taejo made Seoul the capital city. The government set about redesigning the city according to principles set out in the Chinese bureaucratic text "Rites of Zhou". They managed to place buildings like the royal palace Gyeongbokgung and the altar Sajikdan according to the book. However, the book dictated that markets should be placed north of the royal palace. As there was not much space between the royal palace and the mountain just north of the palace, Bugaksan, they decided to place markets elsewhere.
A market roughly in the same area as the current Namdaemun Market finished construction in September 1414, during the reign of King Taejong. It was one of four market construction projects that occurred in the city between 1412 and 1414. A government-licensed shop that specialized in importing silks () was the first to open in the market. Soon afterwards followed a large number of government-licensed shops () that sold a variety of items, but mostly clothing, food, and household items.
Development.
During the 1592–1598 Japanese invasions, 1627 Later Jin invasion, and the 1636 Qing invasion, activity in the market slowed. In the aftermath of these invasions, activity rapidly picked back up, as farmers fled from the countryside and sought opportunities in the capital. Around this time, the market became one of the three largest markets in the city. It mostly operated early in the mornings, so people could buy needed supplies for the day.
Joseon operated under a policy of isolationism after these invasions, and foreigners were relatively uncommon in the markets. However, after Japan forced Joseon to open its ports in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, the number of international traders and shops rapidly increased. Chinese traders went from 99 in 1883 to 1,254 in 1893, Chinese-run shops went from 19 to 142, and 71 Japanese merchants in 1885 rose to 625 by 1890. Local merchants protested against this foreign competition, but nothing could be done.
Beginning in 1896, the Korean Empire (the successor to Joseon) government began efforts to rapidly modernize the country and Seoul. Due to numerous construction projects, a number of shops in the area were displaced, and by January 1897, a number of them moved into a building formerly used for distributing grain to the public () and began selling there. This market is considered a clear predecessor to Namdaemun Market. In contrast to other previous markets, it operated throughout the day.
The markets inside the former granary did not pay taxes until 1899. Taxes were first collected by the Ministry of Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry, and then by the Office of Crown Property in 1901. By 1907, around 250 to 300 merchants operated inside the building. Roughly 50% were Korean, 30% Japanese, and 20% Chinese. According to 1909 research conducted by the Ministry of Finance, daily transactions amounted to 934,035 won.
Japanese colonial period.
From 1910 to 1945, Korea was a colony of the Empire of Japan. In 1911, a significant fire destroyed much of the market. Despite this, the market was the largest in the city around this time, with a total sales volume of 2,181,600 Korean yen in 1916. This was around half of the total sales volume of all markets in the city.
In September 1914, the colonial government proclaimed General Ordinance No. 136, which set out policies for closing and regulating markets. Namdaemun Market was classified as a "Category 1" market, a traditional market that either needed to be developed into a "Category 2" or "Category 3" market or closed altogether. The colonial government attempted to establish a public wholesale market in Namdaemun Market's place, but failed to do so. The Joseon Agriculture Corporation, led by the pro-Japanese collaborator Song Byeong-jun, leased the land of the market for 15 years and invested 50,000 yen to build warehouses and buildings. He charged a 6 yen fee to merchants who wished to use the facilities: a price more expensive than the Korean Empire-era prices. As a result, the number of merchants dropped, but eventually recovered to 126 in 1921. However, a significant fire broke out in fall 1921, which destroyed all shops. Unable to recover from the loss, the Joseon Agriculture Corporation transferred its management of the market to the Jung-ang Trading Corporation, which was established on April 12, 1922, specifically to run the market.
By 1930, sales volume dropped, although the number of merchants in the market was stable at around 200. The drop in sales has been attributed to the economy's shift towards corporate capitalism. Sales of general merchandise also decreased, as modern Japanese-owned department stores opened in the area. In 1931, the colonial government sold ownership of the property to Jung-ang Trading Corporation altogether at a tenth of its market value. Shortly afterwards, Jung-ang raised fees for merchants by around 40%. Korean merchants organized into an association on December 26, 1933, to protest this.
In 1936, the market's name was changed to "Central Product Market" ().
On March 24, 1938, the market's license expired, and the colonial government moved to replace it and Dongdaemun Market with a Gyeongseong Central Wholesale Market. Merchants again protested and organized, this time into the Gyeongseong Food Company. The colonial government implicitly allowed merchants to operate while the Gyeongseong Market was being constructed. After it opened on April 1, 1939, its impact was smaller than expected, so Namdaemun Market continued to thrive.
Liberation of Korea.
After liberation in 1945, more than 200 merchants formed the Namdaemun Market Merchant Association and took over management. Initially, the United States Army Military Government in Korea, which governed the southern half of the peninsula at the time, classified the Association as "enemy property" (Japanese-owned). This was protested by the Association, which argued that 80% of shares were held by Koreans. The immediate outcome of this protest is not known, but by 1952, the Association managed the market.
In 1950, the Korean War began, and most of the 250 shops in the market were destroyed. When vendors returned to the market in June 1951, they found that the area had been cordoned off by barbed wire. Activities restarted with around 100 stalls and makeshift stores in the Bukchang-dong area. By 1953, 150 shops and 500 street stalls were in the market. In 1952, the market restarted the Namdaemun Market Merchant Association. Its president Um Bok-man, who was involved in organized crime, siphoned off funds from the market. He was removed from his position by the Seoul government in 1957, and replaced with Kim Woo-taek. At the time, it sold a large amount of contraband and military supplies from the U.S. military bases. Consequently, it was nicknamed "Dokkaebi Market", after a mischievous goblin-like creature from Korean folklore. "Kkulkkuri-juk", an improvized dish that preceded the modern "budae-jjigae", was sold in the market. The market also began to host numerous North Korean refugees; thus the nickname "Abai Market" () emerged, where "abai" refers to an old person in a North Korean dialect. The market suffered a significant fire in 1954. After which, many merchants relocated to Dongdaemun Market. By 1959, Namdaemun Market had lower business activity than Dongdaemun Market. In 1962, the market's license was revoked due to it not meeting the standards of the city. The license was reinstated in 1967, and it has remained in place until the present.
Redevelopment efforts.
In 1968, mayor of Seoul Kim Hyeon-ok proposed converting the market into an 18-story shopping complex. Shortly afterwards, a significant fire broke out in the market on November 25, 1968. Kim's plans were scaled down to just three floors. More buildings were then constructed over time, with three buildings opening in 1969, two in 1970, and one in 1971. Beginning in 1977, efforts were made to move the wholesale agricultural and marine products vendors to different markets. In the 1980s, efforts were made to make the market's goods more specialized. For example, one of its buildings began selling primarily textiles, clothes, and handicrafts. Specialization in those areas have since persisted.
However, redevelopment on the main building of the market stagnated, due to plans needing 80% approval from the building's occupants. In the mid-1990s, a proposal was forwarded to have the market transformed into 15-story buildings. Construction workers were hired, but in the end no changes were made. Redevelopment continued to stall, even by 2016.
Recent history.
In the 1990s, the market began shifting from wholesales to retail. However, overall market sales significantly dropped. This was due to a number of factors, including the 1997 Asian financial crisis, competition from Dongdaemun Market, and liberalization on import restricts (and thus more competition). Dongdaemun Market became more associated with younger shoppers, whereas Namdaemun Market appealed to older. Furthermore, the ownership structure of the market is reportedly complex, with stores sometimes belonging to five owners. Disagreements between these owners and across stores has reportedly hampered development.
The number of vendors increased from 4,205 in 1982 to 11,886 in 2013. The proportion of goods sold also changed; clothing went from 60% of the market's sales to 36.8%, and accessories went from 5% to 29.5%. Produce and fish sellers went from 5% to being virtually absent from the market during that time. Vendors also shifted from mainly manufacturing their own products to outsourcing production on contract.
The rise of the internet and online shopping has reportedly negatively impacted Namdaemun Market. Whereas Dongdaemun Market and its younger audience reportedly smoothly managed the transition to the internet, Namdaemun Market's older audience preferred to do their shopping in person.
The city of Seoul announced plans to renovate the market in 2007, with renovations continuing into 2010.
Characteristics.
In June 2013, the market had 11,886 shops. 3,501 sold accessories like earrings and hairpins, 3,475 sold clothing, and 909 sold children's clothes. Fashion shops accounted for 66.3% of the total. 973 stores (8.2%) sold kitchen products, handicrafts and local products. 913 were restaurants and health food shops, and 580 sold glasses, watches, and camera. Many of its stores are operated by a single person or family. Goods are typically transported within the market by motorcycle or handcart.
There are also numerous street stalls, with some operating by day and others by night.
Buildings A and B (which are actually each composed of smaller buildings) are together known as the Main Building of the market, and are the oldest buildings in the market. They are in the location of the original granary building used for the market in the Joseon period.
How each building is managed reportedly differs. Generally, the exterior of the buildings, utilities, and exterior security are maintained by the building's "jijuhoe" (). The "jijuhoe" collects upkeep fees from the various merchants. Their funds and activities are managed by a management office. The management office manages security inside the buildings and cleaning the interior.
The market is popular with tourists. It has signs in other languages in order to appeal to them, translators, and multilingual employees are reportedly valued. Health foods like ginseng are reportedly popular with Chinese tourists.
There are a number of alleyways that specialize in certain dishes in the market. One alleyway, in building A, is for "galchi-jorim", spicy braised cutlassfish. Another is for "kal-guksu", a noodle dish. And a third is for "hotteok", stuffed pancakes, including vegetables, nuts, and sweet condiments.
Within the borders of the market is a historic now called Ilchul Apartment (). Its Japanese name was Hinode (). It was primarily used as a short-term residence for people working nearby. After the Korean War, it came to be occupied by war refugees, who continued to live there afterwards. In recent years, few people live in the building; it has mostly come to be used by merchants in Namdaemun Market as office or storage space.

Phil Koperberg

Philip Christian Koperberg (born 28 April 1943), is the Chairman of the New South Wales Emergency Management Committee, responsible for advising the New South Wales government on emergency response strategies, since 2011.
Koperberg is a former Australian politician, was the New South Wales Minister for Climate Change, Environment and Water between 2007 and 2008; and was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, representing the electorate of the Blue Mountains for the Labor Party between 2007–2011. Prior to his political career, Koperberg was the Commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) in Australia between 1997–2007.
In September 1997, Koperberg was appointed the RFS Commissioner when the Service was formed under the Rural Fires Act. Before this he had been Director-General of the New South Wales Bush Fire Service from May 1990. In March 2007 he was elected to State parliament and appointed to the Ministry. However, in December he was forced to stand aside due to a police investigation regarding domestic violence allegations from 1987. The NSW Director of Public Prosecutions declined to press charges and Koperberg was reinstated to the Ministry. He resigned from the Ministry on 22 February 2008. Koperberg did not recontest the 2011 state election.
Background.
Dutch-born Koperberg arrived in Australia in 1953 from Indonesia. Prior to his involvement in emergency management, he worked in various fields including the finance industry.
Koperberg fought his first bushfire as a teenager on the South Coast in 1959. He joined the North Springwood Bush Fire Brigade (now Winmalee Rural Fire Brigade) as a volunteer in 1967, working his way up to become captain of that brigade in 1969 and fire control officer for the Blue Mountains Fire Control Officer between 1970 and 1982. He held positions as the inaugural chair of the Fire Control Officer's Association, chairman of the Bush Fire Council of New South Wales and executive officer of the then Bush Fires Branch of the Office of the Minister for Police and Emergency Services.
Commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.
In 1985 Koperberg was appointed Chairman of the Bush Fire Council of New South Wales and Executive Officer of the Bushfires Branch of the Office of the Minister for Police and Emergency Services. In 1993 he became of Commissioner of Bush Fire Services. On 1 September 1997, following the proclamation of the Rural Fires Act 1997, Phil Koperberg was appointed to the position of Commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.
In April 1999 when severe hail storms battered eastern Sydney causing damage to more than 30,000 properties Koperberg was appointed to operationally coordinate the emergency control / initial recovery effort. He continues to chair the Rural Fire Service Advisory Council, the Bush Fire Co-ordinating Committee and the State Rescue Board. He is a member and director of the Australasian Fire Authorities Council and a member of the Institute of Emergency Services.
Koperberg was Commissioner during the following major environmental events, most of which involved his professional skills:
Legal actions.
In 2007 it was revealed on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's "Four Corners" TV program that legal action was launched by residents in the Blue Mountains against the NSW Rural Fire Service, the local fire brigade, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sydney Catchment Authority, as a result of damage caused by the 2001 Black Christmas/Warragamba bushfires. In separate action, a negligence claim was lodged in the ACT Supreme Court for damages against the NSW and Australian Capital Territory governments resulting from the 2003 Canberra bushfires. Koperberg was listed as a defendant in the Canberra bushfires legal proceedings in which the appellant claimed that he called the NSW Rural Fire Service Fire Control Centre 24 times over ten days, but was ignored. In hearings before the ACT Supreme Court, Koperberg admitted that at a meeting held in Queanbeyan he had understated the threat of the bushfires to Canberra's western suburbs.
Political career.
On 2 November 2006 Koperberg announced his intention to seek Labor Party preselection for the state seat of Blue Mountains in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly at the 2007 state election after Attorney-General and Environment Minister Bob Debus announced he would not recontest his safe Labor seat.
"The move comes despite denials as late as this week by Mr Koperberg that he had no plans to seek preselection in the seat which Labor holds by a 14.8 per cent margin. Mr Koperberg's years of high profile work fighting fires would make him a popular choice for the bushland electorate."
Almost immediately, it was revealed that Koperberg had been issued with an Apprehended Violence Order in 1987 after a domestic violence incident involving his wife of the time, Katherine Specking. On 6 November, Sydney radio personality Alan Jones made comment on air in response to these revelations:
On 12 January 2007, Koperberg stood down from his role as RFS Commissioner in order to begin his campaign for political office. Official notification was sent (via e-mail) to RFS staff the following day announcing that Assistant Commissioner Robin Rogers AFSM had assumed the role of Acting Commissioner.
In the 2007 NSW election, he was elected to the seat of Blue Mountains. On 30 March, New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma announced Koperberg would be the Minister for Climate Change, Environment and Water. In the aftermath of the election, it was revealed that Koperberg's ex-wife Specking had been involved in an affair with Paul Gibson, the Member for Blacktown and as a result the two men were bitter rivals. Koperberg had in fact earlier suggested Gibson was behind the domestic violence allegations, accusing him of running a smear campaign "bordering on evil". However, Gibson was dumped from Cabinet almost immediately when he was accused of assault against an ex-lover, former Minister for Sport Sandra Nori, in 1991. Police later found Gibson had no case to answer.
On 2 December 2007, the claims regarding Koperberg's violence toward Specking re-emerged, this time with the additional implication that he had also assaulted his stepdaughter Paula Coad "with such force that one of her fillings was knocked out". Further claims were laid that the NSW Labor Party knew of the allegations before Koperberg's nomination for election and attempts were made to cover them up. Koperberg maintains he openly declared the allegations during the pre-selection process.
While Koperberg continues to deny any wrongdoing, he was stood down from the front bench of Parliament the following day while a police inquiry was instigated into the allegations, primarily due to pressure on Iemma to take action in light of the allegations against Gibson in March. On 9 January 2008, the police handed the results of their investigation into Koperberg to the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions. "The Sydney Morning Herald" reported that there was speculation Specking and Coad were not prepared to make statements to the police, making it likely Koperberg would be cleared. On 17 January the prospect of any charges being laid was dismissed.
Koperberg resigned from the New South Wales Ministry on 22 February 2008, citing ill health. But an unnamed source close to Koperberg, cited in "The Sydney Morning Herald", said that the real reason for his resignation from the ministry was that he was fed up with continuing unsubstantiated allegations being promulgated by his party colleague, Blacktown MP, Paul Gibson. Verity Firth took over as Minister for Environment and Climate Change and Nathan Rees as Minister for Water.
Koperberg remained on the backbench as member for the Blue Mountains. On 8 October 2010, Koperberg announced that he will not seek Labor Party endorsement or re-election at the 2011 state election citing "bruising factional fighting" and internal party politics.
Post-political career.
Following the 2011 state election that was won by the O'Farrell–Stoner Liberal/National coalition, Koperberg was appointed as chairman of the State Emergency Management Committee. The committee is responsible for advising the NSW government on the state's emergency response strategies. In the wake of the 2013 New South Wales bushfires, the NSW Government appointed Koperberg to the position of Blue Mountains Bushfire Recovery Coordinator. Koperberg is also a member of the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action – a growing cohort of former senior Australian fire and emergency service leaders who have observed how Australia is experiencing increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events that are putting lives, properties and livelihoods at greater risk and overwhelming emergency services.
Honours and awards.
Koperberg has also received the Pingat Ketua Pengarah Bomba from the Malaysian Fire Service.

Bolayır

Bolayır is a village in the Gelibolu District of Çanakkale Province, situated on the Gallipoli Peninsula in the European part of Turkey. Its population is 1,053 (2021).
Between 1958 and the 2013 reorganisation, it was a town ("belde").
The türbe (tomb) of Suleyman Pasha (1316–1357), son of Orhan, the second Bey of the Ottoman Beylik and the grave of the Turkish nationalist poet Namık Kemal (1840–1888) are located in Bolayır. On 26 January 1913, Bolayır was the site of the Battle of Bulair, a major Bulgarian victory over the Ottomans during the First Balkan War.
Bolayır was also the site of the Gallipoli Campaign (1915–1916) duringWorld War I.
The traditional Greek name of Bolayır is Πλαγιάρι ("Plagiari") and in Bulgarian the town is known as Булаир ("Bulair"). It may be the same settlement known as Branchialion in medieval times or, if not, very close to it. A village in Dolni Chiflik Municipality, Varna Province bears the name Bulair in honour of the Bulgarian victory at Bolayır and a Bulgarian military march, the Bulair March, was written to commemorate the battle.
The ruins of the Ancient Greek city of Lysimachia lie nearby.

Whitevine Meadows

Whitevine Meadows () is a 13.0 hectare (32.0 acre) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest east of North and South Perrott in Somerset, notified in 1979.
This site consists of a nationally rare type of neutral grassland together with adjoining areas of scrub and ancient woodland. The Whitevine meadow is unusual in being one of only three British localities where the grass "Gaudinia fragilis" is a prominent and established component of the sward. The scrub provides nest sites for several species of bird, including nightingale ("Luscinia megarhynchos"). Clearings within the scrub support a mixed flora with saw-wort ("Serratula tinctoria"), yellow-wort ("Blackstonia perfoliata") and autumn gentian ("Gentianella amarella"). These sheltered glades provide favourable climatic conditions for butterflies including marbled white ("Melanargia galathea") and silver-washed fritillary ("Argynnis paphia").

Daytona Sportscar

The Daytona Sportscar (sometimes referred to as the Daytona Coupe) is an Australian built reproduction of the Shelby Daytona coupé from 1964. It was built by Richard Bendell, designed by Ross Holder and the chassis builder was Michael Borland. So far eight have been built, by Victorian race car builder Borland Racing Developments, with the first car built in 2001. It has competed in several Australian tarmac rallies since, including "Targa Tasmania" and "Targa West".
As well as the Shelby Daytona, the car bears some resemblance to the Ford Shelby GR-1, a 2005 concept car which was based on the same 1964 model.
Specifications.
Weighing , it is powered by a 6.0 litre (360 in³) LS1 Gen. III V8 engine, which is also used in the Holden Monaro. Top speed is . The chassis is a purpose built space frame. As well as the engine, the car uses mainly Holden Commodore SS components including the brakes, wheels, differential, steering column and controls. It has traction control and ABS braking systems.
Fatal accident.
Australian racing car champion Peter Brock was killed driving a Daytona (coincidentally the original Shelby Daytona was designed by another Peter Brock) owned by Richard Bendell in the Targa West rally on 8 September 2006, when it left the road and hit a tree sideways, in the driver's door.
In an interview the day before the crash, Brock said of the car:

Édouard Roditi

Édouard Roditi (6 June 1910 in Paris, France – 10 May 1992 in Cadiz, Spain) was an American poet, short-story writer, critic and translator.
Literary career.
A prolific writer, Édouard Roditi published numerous volumes of poetry, short stories, and art criticism starting with "Poems for F" (Paris: , 1935). He was also well regarded as a translator, rendering into English original works from French, German, Spanish, Danish, Portuguese and Turkish. He was, for instance, one of the first to translate the work of French poet Saint-John Perse into English, in a volume published in 1944.
In 1961, he translated Yaşar Kemal's epic novel "İnce Memed" (1955) under the English title "Memed, My Hawk". This book was instrumental in introducing the famed Turkish writer to the English-speaking world. "Memed, My Hawk" is still in print. Roditi was a cousin of Kemal's wife, Thilda Serrero. Roditi also translated Robert Schmutzler's "Art Nouveau" (1964) into English, in an edition that is still in print. He also translated such authors as C.P. Cavafy, Paul Celan, Albert Memmi, Fernando Pessoa.
In addition to his poetry and translations, Roditi is perhaps best remembered for the numerous interviews he conducted with modernist artists, including Marc Chagall, Joan Miró, Oskar Kokoschka, Philippe Derome and Hannah Höch. Several of these have been assembled in the collection "Dialogues on Art".
Reflecting his wide reading of works on sexuality as well as his personal experience, Roditi also published a book-length essay in French on homosexuality titled "De l'homosexualité" (Paris: Société des Éditions Modernes/SEDIMO, 1962). The work assesses historical, sociological, religious, medical, legal and literary approaches to the subject; it closes with a seven-page bibliography of sources in French, English and German.
Upbringing, schooling &amp; early jobs.
Édouard Roditi's father was a Sephardi Jew from Istanbul who became an American citizen. His mother was of Ashkenazi and Flemish Catholic descent, and a British citizen. He was born in Paris, where his parents had already been living for a number of years.
Roditi grew up in France and attended public school there before going on to study in England at Elstree School, Charterhouse and briefly at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1929, he moved back to Paris, where he frequented the proponents of Surrealism and became a partner in the Surrealist publishing house Éditions du Sagittaire. During this period, he visited the celebrated salon of Gertrude Stein, whom he found "incredibly pretentious" and "rather offensive."
Roditi traveled to the United States in 1929 and 1932, meeting members of the Harlem Renaissance as well as novelist and photographer Carl van Vechten. He returned in 1937 to take a bachelor's degree in Romance languages at the University of Chicago, then went on to do graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley. During World War II, he served in the French short-wave broadcast unit of the United States Office of War Information and as a translator for the State Department and the Defense Department.
Following the war, he served as a multilingual interpreter for the United Nations Charter Conference in San Francisco. He subsequently returned to Europe to work as a freelance interpreter for international organizations and conferences, including the International War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg. In 1950, during the "Lavender Scare", he was fired from that job. Roditi was part of the Benton Way Group with Charles Aufderheide.
Personal life.
Édouard Roditi had recognized that he was attracted to other men from an early age, and he actively explored the homosexual milieu of dance halls, bars, bathhouses and public cruising areas in Paris starting in his teen years and continuing in other places where he lived thereafter.
Among Roditi's close friends in France in the early 1930s was the American homosexual poet Hart Crane. In the United States in the late 1930s, Roditi befriended a fellow gay Jewish writer Paul Goodman.
Roditi's first book, "Poems for F.", printed in 250 copies in 1935, was inspired by a two-year affair with a married man, probably an Austrian painter, 20 years older than the poet. Roditi kept the identity of F. secret to the end of his life.
In his romantic life, Roditi followed an early-20th-century pattern of seeking out partners among men who did not identify as gay. In a 1984 interview, he recalled, "Personally, I have never been particularly attracted to outright homosexuals, and most of my more enjoyable and lasting relationships have been with bisexual or otherwise normal men in whose love life I was an exception."
He considered himself "thrice chosen" by being Jewish, homosexual, and epileptic, as expressed in his anthology titled "Thrice Chosen" (1981).

Karaağaç, Edirne

Karaağaç is a neighbourhood of the city Edirne, Edirne District, Edirne Province, northwestern Turkey. Its population is 3,062 (2022). It is situated at the border with Greece. Together with the village of Bosna, it is one of the two Turkish settlements in East Thrace situated on the right bank of the river Meriç, therefore within Western Thrace. Karaağaç is 4 km southwest from the center of Edirne, across the river Meriç and opposite the Greek village Kastanies. In 1890, the large Karaağaç railway station was built in the town, which also served Edirne, becoming the last train stop in Turkey to Europe. In 1971, Turkish State Railways (TCDD) constructed a new railway station at the opposite side of the river, abandoning the former one, which is now used as Trakya University's Faculty of Fine Arts.
The Treaty of Lausanne Monument and Museum, which opened in 1998, are located next to the former railway station.
History.
When Greece held the town (1920-1923), Karaağaç was renamed Orestias, in remembrance of the ancient Thracian town with the same name, which probably lay near or at the site of present-day Edirne. Orestias or Orestia is thought to have been the same town as Uscudama (other variants: Uskudama, Uskadama, Uskodama) or Odrysa (other variants: Odrysia, Odrysos, Odrysus) which was the first Odrysian capital. Orestias took its name by the Greeks, at least from the time Philip II of Macedon took over the town. The Roman emperor Hadrian expanded the town into a city, gave it a strong fortification and renamed it Hadrianopolis. However the name Orestias was still used by many writers at the Byzantine era, along with Hadrianopolis.

The FMW Women's Championship consisted of two Japanese women's professional wrestling championships, the FMW Independent Women's Championship and the WWA World Women's Championship. The championships were contested in the promotion Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW). During the heyday of FMW, the female wrestlers wrestled in the same types of bloody death matches as the FMW men, and were feared by other Japanese female wrestlers for their toughness and intensity.

Fortress Around Your Heart

"Fortress Around Your Heart" is a hit single released from Sting's 1985 debut solo studio album "The Dream of the Blue Turtles". It was released as the album's third single in the UK, and the second single in the US.
The song was later included on the U.S. release of the "" compilation album.
Song information.
"Fortress Around Your Heart" was inspired by Sting's divorce. The pain he felt at the collapse of his first marriage led him to write some of his biggest hits, including "Every Breath You Take" and "Wrapped Around Your Finger". Sting wrote the song in the studio in Barbados in 1985. The song features a Branford Marsalis sax solo. In a "Musician" magazine interview later that year, Sting said:
"Fortress" is about appeasement, about trying to bridge the gaps between individuals. The central image is a minefield that you've laid around this other person to try and protect them. Then you realize that you have to walk back through it. I think it's one of the best choruses I've ever written.
During one of Sting's first performances of the song in concert in Paris, his crew lowered a tiny fortress onto the stage in a parody of the similar Stonehenge scene from the film "This Is Spinal Tap".
Reception.
"Billboard" said that the single is "challenging, complex and rather difficult," with "mysterious poetic imagery" and a melody that is "more recitative than hook." "Cash Box" said that the song illustrated Sting's "genius as songwriter," although it is "tinged with melancholy" and "less jazzy and more Police-like than Sting's previous US single, "If You Love Somebody Set Them Free."
Single release.
The song was also released as a single, and reached #8 and #49 on the U.S. and U.K. singles charts, respectively. It also reached #1 for two weeks on the "Billboard" Top Rock Tracks chart, becoming his second consecutive #1 hit on this chart.

Michael Richard Barton (14 October 1914 – 1 July 2006) was an English first-class cricketer. A right-handed batsman, in a first-class career lasting from 1935 to 1955, he scored 5965 runs at 25.82, with 7 hundreds and a highest score of 192.
He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and appeared for Oxford University from 1935 to 1937, winning a Blue in the latter two years. He also played for Norfolk in the Minor Counties Championship from 1933 to 1947.
After his Oxford days his first-class career appeared to be over, but Surrey found themselves short of a captain (who in those days by convention had to be an amateur) and approached him. He captained them in some games in 1948, and was the official club captain from 1949 to 1951. Surrey were the joint County Champions with Lancashire in 1950.
He was Surrey President in 1983.

Everett Stonequist

Everett Verner Stonequist (October 5, 1901 – March 26, 1979) was an American Sociologist perhaps best known for his 1937 book, "The Marginal Man"
Life &amp; Work.
Stonequist was born in Worcester, Mass. and received his A.B. degree in History and Sociology at Clark University. He later studied at Cornell University, Columbia University, and the University of Paris. He received his doctorate in Sociology at the University of Chicago in 1930.
Stonequist taught and conducted research at the University of Hawaii, Duke University, and the University of Missouri. In 1970 Stonequist was honored by Union College in Schenectady for his contributions to the area of race relations. His expertise extended into many areas of research, including the problems of Jews living in primarily Gentile areas, and conditions in Ethiopia, Cyprus, Egypt, Kenya, Jordan, and Israel. In these respects he was clearly as much an anthropologist by inclination as a sociologist.
Stonequist spent most of his academic life teaching at Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, NY, where he was a well-known figure as a leader on the city's planning commission and housing authority. His work led to the construction of low-cost housing to local residents, and the Stonequist Apartments senior citizen complex. He chaired the Saratoga Springs Housing Authority for almost 30 years and was a technical consultant and planner for the city planning board for 19 years. He was a popular speaker who was widely sought by high school groups and civic, social, and religious organizations.
""He chaired the Skidmore College Department of Sociology from 1930 to 1970. His book, The Marginal Man, called attention to the problems experienced by people making transitions between different cultures, and specifically to pressures felt by minority and ethnic group members in American society. The book is generally credited with laying groundwork for later studies of "marginal" ethnic and occupational groups.""
Stonequist's sociological work on marginality builds on that of his chief mentor at Chicago, Robert E. Park. "R. E. Park...[was] Stonequist's teacher and the originator of the term marginal man"
Park's notion that an individual suspended between two cultural realities is marginal results in difficulties in establishing an identity. This work was continued and developed further by Howard S. Becker and others most notably J M Billson, L H Bowker, F M Cox, A F Buono, J B Kamm, J Golden, Mark A Grey, and R A Stebbins.
""One of Park's students [at Chicago], Everett Stonequist, was writing "The Marginal Man--A Study in Personality and Culture Conflict" (1937). He described the marginal man as "one who is poised in psychological uncertainty between two or more social worlds, reflecting in his soul the discords and harmonies, repulsions and attractions of these worlds." Stonequist's study examines representative types of marginal persons.""
In 1980, Dr. Stonequist's family and friends established the Everett V. Stonequist Award, given annually to a graduating senior who has shown outstanding interest and achievement in the study of sociology at Skidmore. The recipient, whose interest and grades in sociology are among the award criteria, is selected by the faculty of the Department of Sociology, Anthropology, and Social Work.

Isopogon anemonifolius

Isopogon anemonifolius, commonly known as broad-leaved drumsticks, is a shrub of the family Proteaceae that is native only to eastern New South Wales in Australia. It occurs naturally in woodland, open forest, and heathland on sandstone soils. "I. anemonifolius" usually ranges between one and two metres in height, and is generally smaller in exposed heathland. Its leaves are divided and narrow, though broader than those of the related "Isopogon anethifolius", and have a purplish tinge during the cooler months. The yellow flowers appear during late spring or early summer and are displayed prominently. They are followed by round grey cones, which give the plant its common name "drumsticks". The small hairy seeds are found in the old flower parts.
A long-lived plant reaching an age of up to 60 years, "I. anemonifolius" resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, after bushfire. Seedlings appear in the year following a fire. Although "I. anemonifolius" was collected by Daniel Solander in 1770, it was not described until 1796 by Richard Salisbury. Several varieties have been named, though none are now recognised as distinct. It was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1791. "I. anemonifolius" grows readily in the garden if located in a sunny or part-shaded spot with sandy soil and good drainage.
Description.
"Isopogon anemonifolius" grows as an evergreen, woody shrub to in height, but is restricted to approximately on exposed heaths and headlands. The leaves are long and forked after into three segments, then often forked a second time. The leaf tips are pointed. Leaves can vary markedly on single plants, with some leaves undivided. Leaf surfaces are generally smooth, though occasionally covered with fine hair. Its flat leaves distinguish it from the terete (round in cross-section) leaves of "Isopogon anethifolius"; they are also broader, at wide compared with the 1 mm ( in) wide leaves of the latter species. The new growth and leaves of "I. anemonifolius" may be flushed red to purple, particularly in winter. The globular inflorescences appear any time from July to January, being most abundant in October. They are in diameter, and grow terminally at the tips of branches, or occasionally axillary (arising on short stems off branches). The individual flowers average long. They are straight stalkless structures arising from a basal scale. The perianth, a tube that envelopes the flower's sexual organs, splits into four segments, revealing a thin delicate style tipped with the stigma. At the ends of the four perianth segments are the male pollen-bearing structures known as anthers. Arranged in a spiral pattern, the flowers open from the bottom of the flowerhead inwards. Flowering is followed by the development of the round fruiting cones, which have a diameter of . The seed-bearing nuts are small—less than across—and lined with hairs.
Taxonomy.
Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander, after collecting a specimen at Botany Bay in 1770 on the first voyage of Captain James Cook, was the first to write of this species. He gave it the name "Leucadendron apiifolium", but never officially described it. The specific epithet referred to the similarity of its leaves to "Apium" (celery).
In 1796, English botanist Richard Salisbury published a formal description of the species, from a specimen collected in Port Jackson (Sydney). He gave it the name "Protea anemonifolia", the specific epithet derived from "anemone" and "folium", the latter meaning "leaf", highlighting the resemblance of its leaves to those of anemones. The common name "drumsticks" is derived from their globular cones.
In 1799, the Spanish botanist Antonio José Cavanilles described "Protea tridactylides", later identified as a junior synonym by Salisbury and the English horticulturalist Joseph Knight. Salisbury founded the new genus "Atylus" in 1807 to remove this and other species from "Protea", but did not make proper combinations for them in the new genus. It gained its current name in 1809 when it was redescribed as the anemone-leaved isopogon ("Isopogon anemonefolius") in the controversial work "On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae", published under Knight's name but written by Salisbury. Scottish naturalist Robert Brown had written of the genus "Isopogon" but Salisbury and Knight had hurried out their work before Brown's. Brown's description appeared in his paper "On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae", subsequently published as "On the Proteaceae of Jussieu" in the "Transactions of the Linnean Society" in 1810.
In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze published "Revisio generum plantarum", his response to what he perceived as a lack of method in existing nomenclatural practice. He revived the genus "Atylus" on the grounds of priority, and correctly made the combination "Atylus anemonifolius". However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus "Isopogon" was nomenclaturally conserved over "Atylus" by the International Botanical Congress of 1905.
Several varieties have been described but have been synonymised with "I. anemonifolius" or recognised as distinct species. Brown described varieties "glaber", identified by wholly smooth leaves and branches, and "pubescens", with leaves and branches covered in fine pale grey hairs, in 1830. English botanist George Bentham tentatively described variety "pubiflorus" in his 1870 work "Flora Australiensis". He queried that it may have been from Sydney, and had a slightly hairy perianth. These are not regarded as distinct. Victorian Government botanist Ferdinand von Mueller described "I. anemonifolius" var. "tenuifolius" in 1870, now recognised as "I. prostratus". Australian botanist Edwin Cheel described forma "simplicifolia" in 1923, from collections from Mount Victoria and Hornsby. He described it as having mostly unlobed (simple) leaves compared with the typical form. His variety "ceratophylloides" is now a separate species, "I. petiolaris".
Distribution and habitat.
"I. anemonifolius" is found along the east coast of New South Wales, from near the Victorian border almost to (and possibly reaching) Queensland. It is most common between Smoky Cape and Ulladulla. There is an outlying population in the vicinity of Torrington in the New England region. It occurs naturally from sea level to and is found on low-nutrient sandstone soils in heathland and dry sclerophyll woodland, particularly along ridges or tops of hills. Typical woodland trees it is associated with include the scribbly gums "Eucalyptus haemastoma" and "E. sclerophylla", yertchuk ("E. consideniana"), yellow bloodwood ("Corymbia eximia"), red bloodwood ("C. gummifera") and smooth-barked apple ("Angophora costata"), and heathland plants such as rusty banksia ("Banksia oblongifolia"), swamp banksia ("B. paludosa"), mountain devil ("Lambertia formosa"), conesticks ("Petrophile pulchella"), tick bush ("Kunzea ambigua"), forest oak ("Allocasuarina torulosa") and "Hakea laevipes".
Ecology.
"I. anemonifolius" is a long-lived plant, with a lifespan of 60 years. It resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, approximately two months after being burnt in a bushfire. The resultant new growth takes two years to flower, though older plants with larger lignotubers are able to re-grow more quickly. "I. anemonifolius" is slow-growing; a 1990 field study in Brisbane Water National Park found that the lignotuber grew at a rate of 0.173 cm per existing cm of lignotuber per year, yielding a lignotuber of around in diameter at 10 years of age and diameter at 20 years of age. The largest lignotubers found have a diameter of .
Plants need a lignotuber of diameter to survive low intensity fires. Plants are able to resprout after more intense fires once they reach 15 years of age. "I. anemonifolius" is also serotinous—the seeds are held on the plant as a canopy-based seedbank and are released after fire. Most seedlings arise within a year of a bushfire, though very few are seen at other times. The seedbank is most productive between 25 and 35 years after a previous fire. However, seedlings may be outcompeted by seedlings of obligate seeder species. The seeds of "I. anemonifolius" fall directly to the ground or are blown a short distance by wind. Young plants flower about seven years after germinating from seed. Repeated bushfire intervals of less than 10 years' duration are likely to result both in reduced survival of older plants and in recruitment of seedlings, possibly leading to local extinction in 50 years. Intervals of at least 12–13 years for low intensity fires and 15 years for hotter fires are needed for population stability.
Leaf spotting is caused by the fungus "Vizella". Flower buds may be damaged by weevils.
Cultivation.
"I. anemonifolius" was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1791. Knight reported that it flowered and set seed there. With attractive foliage and prominently displayed flowers and cones, "I. anemonifolius" adapts readily to cultivation; plants can be grown in rock gardens, as borders, or as a pot plant. Garden plants can be variable, with either upright or spreading habits; and some maintain a naturally compact habit without pruning. It grows readily in sandy well-drained soil in either a sunny or part-shaded position. The species is suited to USDA hardiness zones 9 to 11. It is hardy in frosts and dry spells, but produces more flowers with extra moisture. It can be pruned heavily once established.
Propagation is by seed or cuttings of hardened growth less than a year old. The seed can be collected from the cones and stored; they are best sown in spring or autumn. The stems and flowers are long-lasting if put in water. The flowers, cones and foliage are used in the cut-flower industry.
"Isopogon" 'Woorikee 2000' is a selected dwarf form of "I. anemonifolius", propagated by Bill Molyneux of Austraflora Nursery in Victoria. It produces abundant flowerheads. Plant Breeders Rights were granted in Australia in 1997 and the cultivar became commercially available in 1999. Another dwarf cultivar, 'Little Drumsticks', is also sold.

Sitelink

Sitelinks are hyperlinks to website subpages that appear under certain Google listings in order to help users navigate the site. The site owner cannot add any sitelinks; Google adds them through its own secret automated algorithms. If you have a Google Adwords program you can create campaign and ad group level sitelinks. The site owner can, however, block individual sitelinks, which may be useful if he deems them unhelpful. In Google, there are a minimum of one and a maximum of ten sitelinks per site. According to John I Jerkovic, "Every site should strive to get sitelinks, as they imply authority as well as web presence. Sitelinks also occupy additional search results screen real estate, the space that pushes your competitors further down the results page — something to be desired." Sitelinks are also said to appear "on some search results where Google thinks one result is far more relevant than other results (like navigational or brand related searches)".
Search engine optimization experts consider sitelinks to be an important measure of how "trusted" a site is, and accordingly have attempted to deduce what causes them to appear. These efforts have included looking at Google patents. According to these patents, sitelinks are derived from user behavior, in particular, the number of times a page has been accessed, the amount of time spent on the page, and from the content of the page itself—whether the page contains commercial transactions, etc. In an alternative embodiment, it is suggested that web-site providers might provide the search engine system with a list of favoured web-pages within their own web-site.
Sitelinks with less than 15 characters seem to perform best, according to Google Senior Product Manager Jerry Dischler. There is also an unrelated paid Sitelinks feature associated with Google sponsored links, that allows site owners to submit up to 10 links and allow Google to pick the 4 that are most pertinent to the search.

Tamborine Mountain

Tamborine Mountain, also known simply as Mount Tamborine, is a plateau, geographic subregion and locality in the Scenic Rim Region of Queensland, Australia. In the , Tamborine Mountain had a population of 8,105 people.
Geography.
The plateau is a , . The name is from the Yugumbir language of the Wangerriburra Clan, a from "Jambireen" meaning "wild lime tree", or "dum/gom bireen" meaning "yam in a cliff".
There are three towns on the plateau: North Tamborine, Eagle Heights and Mount Tamborine, with a total population of about 5,100. The plateau is classified as a rural area, with zoning restrictions that prohibit property from being subdivided. There is no reticulated water supply or sewerage system, and residents are dependent on rainwater, bores and septic systems. Many residents commute to work on the Gold Coast or in Brisbane.
The Tamborine Mountain road network enables access to the plateau from four points in the surrounding lowlands, providing alternatives in case of flooding, other natural disasters, or planned maintenance works.
Geology.
The geological origin of the plateau is a lava flow from the Mount Warning volcanic eruption 22 million years ago. Tamborine Mountain rises at the start of the north-east section of the Scenic Rim, the name given to a group of mountains in South East Queensland.
Important Bird Area.
Parts of the plateau and surrounding foothills encompassing the wet subtropical rainforest habitats below the largely cleared plateau summit, and above the surrounding eucalypt forests, have been identified as a Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. It includes the southern fragments of the Tamborine National Park. The IBA supports an isolated northern population of Albert's lyrebirds, as well as pale-yellow robins, green catbirds, regent bowerbirds and Australian logrunners. Additional significant birds recorded from the site are glossy black cockatoos, sooty owls, marbled frogmouths and noisy pittas. Other animals present in the IBA include platypuses, short-beaked echidnas and Richmond birdwings.
Roads.
A group of roads provides access to the mountain community from various lowland localities. These roads ensure continuity of access in times of flooding or other natural disasters, and during planned maintenance activities.
History.
Tamborine Mountain was inhabited by Aboriginal people for tens of thousands of years and, at the time of early British colonisation, it was in territory of the Wanggeriburra clan of the Yugambeh people. The origin of the name Tamborine comes from the anglicised version of the word "Jambreen" from the Yugambeh language. The spelling also appears on early records as Tchambreem, Tamboreen and even Goombireen, meaning "place of yams", and refers only to a specific vicinity within the modern day settlement of Tamborine. The actual mountain had a different name which appears to have not been recorded.
By the late 1850s, most of the Wanggeriburra had left the region.
Prior to British settlement, the mountain was covered with a diverse range of forest types. Unlike the lower land surrounding the mountain, the thick scrub on the mountain was seen as a barrier to settlement so the mountain was not opened for selection until 1875. However, the selectors were living in the surrounding area and being within of their selections were exempt from the requirements to live on their selections. Most did not develop the land and sold it once they were granted freehold. In 1878 the first selectors settled on the mountain blocks: John O'Callaghan (deputising for William Walsh) and his nephew, E.H. O'Callaghan. By 1886 most of the mountain had been selected but electoral rolls and church records suggest very few people were living on the mountain.
On 30 January 1893, auctioneers Arthur Martin &amp; Co offered 128 blocks of land, mostly lots, in the St Bernard Estate, bounded by Alpine Terrace to the north and to the south by Power Parade, St Bernard Street and Siganto Street. The lots were described as suitable for gentlemen's residences with "scenery unsurpassed in Australia" and for the shooter "turkeys, pigeons, wallabies and kangaroos abound".
Tambourine Mountain Provisional School opened in February 1893 in a small cottage provided by William Geissman. On 2 February 1900 it became Tambourine Mountain State School, later adopting the spelling Tamborine Mountain State School.
Much clearing for agriculture took place, though efforts were made to protect the natural values of the area, with Witches Falls National Park (now part of the Tamborine National Park) being declared in 1908, the first in Queensland. The Tamborine National Park is made up of 12 separate sections of land, mainly remnant rainforest, on the plateau and surrounding foothills. A tourist road to the mountain was opened in 1924.
St Bernard State School opened on 27 January 1914.
On 30 May 1926, a United Protestant Church was opened in Eagle Heights Road on land donated by Mrs SA Jenyns. It was built by Mr V Anderson. It was available for use by all Protestant denominations but legally owned by the Presbyterian Church. The church continued to be used in that way until the late 1960s. It was purchased by May and Henry Bishopp in 1982 and donated to the Tamborine Mountain Historical Society, who relocated the church to their Tamborine Mountain Heritage Centre at 53 Wongawallan Road ().
In 1927, a branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association was established.
In 1930 land was purchased at 2–4 Geissmann Street on the corner with Main Street () as a site for a Presbyterian church. A stump capping ceremony was held on 31 January 1931. The Mount Tamborine Presbyterian Church church officially opened on Saturday on 20 June 1931. The total cost of the land and the building was £450. The manse was located at 29 Griffith Street. By 1972 the growing congregation was too large for the church and so it was decided to purchase a nearby site at 34–36 Main Street (). The United Protestant Church was closed in March 1972 and sold for $10,000 to Mr E Tannock to fund the new church with the bell and its tower being removed to incorporate into the new church. The manse in Griffith Street was also sold to raise funds. The new church was consecrated on 3 May 1975 by Reverend Colin Kay. A hall was erected at the rear of the new church in 1980.

Kickin' It Old Skool

Kickin' It Old Skool is a 2007 American comedy film directed by Harvey Glazer, written by Trace Slobotkin, and starring Jamie Kennedy (who also serves as a producer), Bobby Lee, Maria Menounos, Michael Rosenbaum and Vivica A. Fox, with a cameo appearance by Alan Ruck, reprising his role from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" as Dr. Cameron Frye.
The plot follows a young breakdancer who hits his head during a talent show in 1986 and slips into a coma. Waking in 2006, he looks to revive his team, with the help of his girlfriend and his parents. It was released on April 27, 2007, to critical and commercial failure, grossing a fifth of its budget.
Plot.
In 1986, twelve-year-old Justin "Rocketshoe" Schumacher and his breakdancing group, The Funky Fresh Boyz (Darnell "Prince Def Rock" Jackson, Aki "Chilly Chill" Terasaki, and Hector "Popcorn" Jimenez), are ready for the annual talent show. The somewhat shy Justin has a crush on Jennifer, and gives her a Garbage Pail Kid card in exchange for her Smurfette figurine. His rival, obnoxious rich kid Kip Unger, shows up and gives her an expensive necklace. Justin and the Funky Fresh Boyz start the show, with his parents, Marty and Sylvia cheering for him. In an effort to impress Jen and win the contest, Justin uses a dangerous and untested headspin maneuver, which results in him flipping off the stage and falling into a coma.
Twenty years later, Justin is still comatose. Dr. Cameron Frye tells Marty and Sylvia that at this point, there is little sign that Justin will recover, and they decide to pull the plug. As his parents say goodbye and leave, however, a janitor rolls by with a radio playing the same song from the 1986 talent competition, "Rockit" by Herbie Hancock. It jars Justin's brain to function, waking him. As a result, Justin now finds himself suddenly 31 years old, going on 32. In addition, his parents were bankrupt from overdue life support payments. Jen, who has become a girls' dance instructor, is engaged to Kip. Kip is now an obnoxious promoter, and is set to host a breakdance contest broadcast on national television, with a grand prize of $100,000. Justin realizes that the money could help him repay his parents for what they've spent on his medical bills. Kip is sarcastic and still despises Justin, and schemes to keep him off the show and away from Jen.
Justin has difficulty adjusting to both his deteriorated physical condition and the severe culture shock after 20 years, and is nearly arrested as a child predator. He is rescued from mall security by his old friend, and Funky Fresh Boy, Darnell. Darnell is now a toy store employee and failed inventor, who is frequently slapped around by his wife. He explains much of what has changed in the past 20 years to Justin, before re-introducing him to the rest of the crew. Aki is an accountant, and has lost his old stereotypical Asian accent thanks to English classes. In addition, Aki is also trying to woo a colleague, Yun, who claims he might have a 2% chance of sleeping with her if he were a professional breakdancer. Hector is now an overweight meter maid. Despite their reluctance to return to the '80s lifestyle, they agree to try to retrain their faded breakdancing skills to help Justin.
Initially, the four are terrible, but their skills improve greatly with Justin's help, as Aki studies a RoboSapien toy to reclaim his mastery of the robot. Justin and Jen begin reminiscing about the old days. He eventually asks her on a date, which she thinks is just still a harmless crush. However, with the help of the Internet and practicing on Hector wearing a bra, Justin learns how to please a woman quite well. A surprise appearance by David Hasselhoff allows the pair to go on a date in KITT from "Knight Rider". However, just as Justin has her shirt off and is making his move, Kip calls, leading Jen to be reminded that she is still engaged to him and runs off embarrassed.
During a rather sour birthday party celebration, Justin is confronted by the diminutive but talented Cole of the Iced Cole Crew, a group hired by Kip to ensure that the Funky Fresh Boyz lose. Cole challenges Justin to a dance-off in the parking lot. After Cole's impressive routine, along with some various flashbacks from his years in the coma, a nervous and depressed Justin vomits on Cole and runs off. He becomes too disillusioned to compete on the show. The rest of the Boyz decide to have a breakdancing homeless man stand in. Kip gloats to Jen about his psychological victory over Justin, which spurs her to finally break up with him. As the dance tournament progresses, the Funky Fresh Boyz and the Iced Cole Crew each progress in their individual brackets toward the finals. Jen finds Justin sulking in a local bar, and convinces him that she wants to be with him and to come back to compete in the show.
Justin convinces his worried parents that he will be all right, reciting the lyrics to the theme song from "Diff'rent Strokes" as an inspirational speech. Although Kip tries to prevent him from dancing, Jen stirs the crowd and Cole into letting him dance, and the FFB get the win when Justin is able to successfully complete the headspin maneuver from '86. An outraged Kip has a tantrum, which leads him to be fired from the network. He is then knocked out by a man from earlier in the film for using the slur "retarded", and is urinated on by the homeless dancer. The Funky Fresh Boyz win the prize money, and Justin and Jen wed and save his parents' house.
In an epilogue, Jen tries to teach Justin how to use an iPod, though he is having trouble finding where to put the cassette tape in. Darnell has invented the 98¢ store, but his wife continues to abuse him. Hector finds work as a Jennifer Lopez impersonator in Las Vegas, and Aki marries Yun in a lavish Jewish ceremony, which has increased his chances of sleeping with her to 3%. Kip never recovered fully from being punched, and is a judge on "Dancing with the Stars".
Reception.
Box office.
The film grossed $2.49 million at its opening weekend and went on to gross a total of $4.7 million as opposed to its $25.7 million budget, making it a box-office bomb.

Vinson Cole

Vinson Cole (born November 21, 1950) is an American operatic tenor.
Early life.
A native of Kansas City, the tenor studied at the Conservatory of Music and Dance at the University of Missouri-Kansas City; the Philadelphia Musical Academy; and at the Curtis Institute of Music with Margaret Harshaw.
Singing career.
He made his European debut in Angers, France in Handel's "Acis and Galatea" and followed that with the role of Belmonte in Mozart's "Abduction from the Seraglio" with the Welsh National Opera. In 1977, his youthful promise was recognized when he won the Metropolitan Opera Auditions, the WGN Competition, and was awarded both Rockefeller Foundation and National Opera Institute grants.
As his career unfolded, he went on to sing leading roles in many major opera houses including the Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera, Opéra National de Paris and Paris Opera-Bastille, Teatro alla Scala, and the theatres in Berlin, Vienna, and Hamburg. For nine years, he sang at the Salzburg Festival. In the United States, he has sung with the New York City, Seattle, Houston, Santa Fe, and St. Louis opera companies.
In 1997, he returned to open the season at La Scala as Renaud in Gluck's "Armide" with Riccardo Muti conducting. He made his Chicago Lyric Opera debut in the title role of Mozart's "Idomeneo" in 1998 and his debut with the Royal Opera at Covent Garden in 1999 in another Mozart title role, "La Clemenza di Tito". In the 2001 season, he returned to the Met as Alfredo in "La traviata" opposite the Violetta of June Anderson.
Cole is closely identified with the French repertory. He began moving in that direction in 1984, after he sang in the "Manon" centennial performances at Paris's Opéra Comique. Not long afterward, he sang the tenor version of Gluck's "Orphée" in Seattle, after which many other French works came his way: "Lakmé", "Werther", "Carmen", "Don Carlos", "Faust", and "La damnation de Faust".
Cole has sung extensively with orchestras throughout his career and has worked with many of the world's leading conductors including Herbert von Karajan, Sir Georg Solti (with whom he recorded the Mozart "Requiem" on the 200th anniversary of the composer's death), Seiji Ozawa, Sir Simon Rattle, Kurt Masur, James Levine, Edo de Waart, Charles Dutoit, Michael Tilson Thomas, Gerard Schwarz, Andrew Davis, Zubin Mehta, Riccardo Muti, Carlo Maria Giulini, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Claudio Abbado, and Daniel Barenboim.
Teaching.
Cole has taught at the University of Washington School of Music, the New England Conservatory of Music and at the Aspen Music Festival and School. He has also conducted masterclasses for the San Francisco Opera's Merola Program and the Canadian Opera Company. He is currently a faculty member at the Curtis Institute of Music, Conservatory of Music and Dance at UMKC and the Cleveland Institute of Music. Mr. Cole resides in Mission, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City.

In 1958 he made his debut in Verdi's "Falstaff". In 1965, he sang the first of many roles with the New York City Opera. He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1970, where he continued to perform until 1997. He was its staff diction coach from 1979 to 2009.

"The New York Times" commented: "Reviewers over the years praised Mr. Castel’s rich dramatic characterizations, his sensitive musicianship and, not surprisingly, his impeccable diction."
A polyglot, Castel spoke Portuguese, Ladino, German, French, Spanish, Italian and English with native or near-native fluency. He was an internationally known language and diction coach, writing the book "A Singer’s Manual of Spanish Lyric Diction" and translating an extensive annotated series of librettos of French, German and Italian operas, adding the pronunciation of every word in the operas' original languages using the International Phonetic Alphabet. These libretti "are used by singers, teachers and conservatories throughout North America and Europe." He was a member of the faculties of The Juilliard School of Music and Mannes School of Music in New York and Boston University, and was a lecturer, teacher and master class leader at other universities and conservatories around the world. His language and diction classes are taught at Juilliard, Eastman School of Music, Indiana University, New York University, Metropolitan Opera, New York City Opera, Chicago Opera, Pittsburgh Opera, the Opera NUOVA Vocal Intensive Program in Edmonton, Alberta, and American Institute of Musical Studies in Graz, Austria.

Claramae Turner

Claramae Turner (née Haas; October 28, 1920 – May 18, 2013) was an American operatic contralto, perhaps best known for her appearance in the film "Carousel" (1956), adapted from the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical of the same name.
Early life.
Born in the great Central Valley, outside Dinuba, California, she began her career at the Bush Street Music Hall in San Francisco, where she sang the contralto leads in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas; at the same time she joined the chorus of San Francisco Opera. 
Career.
She made her San Francisco Opera principal debut as The Voice in "The Tales of Hoffmann" in 1945, and sang with the Metropolitan Opera from 1946 to 1950, appearing in "Faust" (as Marthe, opposite Raoul Jobin), "Boris Godunov" (as the Hôtesse, with Ezio Pinza), "Aida" (as Amneris), "Hansel and Gretel" (as Gertrud), "Roméo et Juliette" (as Gertrude, with Jussi Björling and Bidu Sayão), "The Marriage of Figaro" (as Marcellina), "Siegfried" (as Erda, with Lauritz Melchior and Astrid Varnay), "Cavalleria rusticana" (as Lucia), "The Barber of Seville" (as Berta, opposite Giuseppe Valdengo and Lily Pons), "Peter Grimes" (as Auntie), and "Gianni Schicchi" (as Zita).
Turner then sang with the New York City Opera from 1953 to 1969, in "The Medium", "Hansel and Gretel" (now as The Witch), "Œdipus rex" (as Jocasta, with Richard Cassilly, conducted by Leopold Stokowski), "Suor Angelica" (as the Zia Principessa, conducted by Julius Rudel), "Carmen", "Louise" (as the Mère), "The Ballad of Baby Doe" (as Augusta, with Beverly Sills), "Dialogues of the Carmelites" (as Madame de Croissy), "Bomarzo" (as Diana Orsini, opposite Salvador Novoa, directed by Tito Capobianco), "Iolanthe" (as the Queen of the Fairies), Lady Jane in "Patience" and "The Mikado" (as Katisha), among others.
She created the role of Madame Flora in Gian Carlo Menotti's "The Medium", in 1946 at its first performances at Columbia University. She reprised the role in an episode of "Omnibus" on television, conducted by Werner Torkanowsky (1959). She also recorded the role of Ma Moss in Aaron Copland's "The Tender Land" (opposite Joy Clements and Norman Treigle, conducted by the composer, 1965), "Bomarzo" (1967), and Gertrud in an English version of Engelbert Humperdinck's "Hansel and Gretel", starring Risë Stevens and Nadine Conner (1947). This performance was one of the first Metropolitan Opera record albums of a complete opera ever released (by Columbia Masterworks Records). Miss Turner reprised the role on television in a performance on NBC Opera Theatre.
For radio, she sang the role of Ulrica in Arturo Toscanini's 1954 concert version of Verdi's "Un ballo in maschera", co-starring Herva Nelli, Jan Peerce, and Robert Merrill, in the conductor's final complete operatic performance. This performance was later released on LP and CD by RCA Victor.
In 1956, Turner appeared in her only film, Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Carousel" (with Shirley Jones), based on the successful stage musical. In the film, she played the role of Nettie Fowler.
She sang the role of Nettie again in a Command Records studio cast recording of "Carousel", starring Alfred Drake and Roberta Peters, recorded in 1962.
The song "I Left My Heart in San Francisco" was written for Turner, and it was she, not Tony Bennett, who originally sang it. However, it was Bennett who first recorded it.
In 1965 Turner sang the role of Ma Moss in an abridged recording of Aaron Copland's opera "The Tender Land" with the New York Philharmonic conducted by the composer (Columbia records MS6814).
In 1970, Turner collaborated with Scott McKenzie, making a cameo appearance while McKenzie was performing at the Great American Music Hall. Together, they sang "San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)" as a duet. Fans praised Turner's version of the song, prompting her to record her own version in 1971, making it her first and only pop tune.
Albums have been released of Turner in complete live recordings of Verdi's "La forza del destino", starring Zinka Milanov, Mario Del Monaco, and Leonard Warren, in a New Orleans performance conducted by Walter Herbert, and the Verdi "Requiem", conducted by Guido Cantelli.
Death.
Turner retired in the 1980s and moved to a rural area, where she lived for the rest of her life. She died of natural causes on May 18, 2013, at her home in Santa Rosa, California. She was 92 years old. Turner is buried in Eureka, California.

İnce Memed

İnce Memed is a series of four epic novels written by the Turkish novelist of Kurdish descent Yaşar Kemal. The novel narrates the tale of Memed, the only son of a poor widow, who, after having witnessed the cruelties and injustices of feudalism under "Abdi Ağa"'s (the landlord) yoke, decides to take up arms and emancipate the landless peasants of Çukurova. The novel is set in the early years of the Turkish Republic. 
"İnce Memed" (1955), the first novel in the tetralogy, was Kemal's first published novel. Subsequent volumes of the İnce Memed saga were published in 1969, 1984 and 1987. The tetralogy took Kemal thirty-nine years to complete. The four-volume series was intended by Kemal to be ‘the epic of Anatolia.’
The main character is thought to be loosely based on a real historical bandit named "Safiye Memed".
The first novel adapted into a feature-length movie named as "Memed, My Hawk" in 1984 by director Peter Ustinov.

Saarbrücken Airport

Saarbrücken Airport , or "Flughafen Saarbrücken" or "Ensheim Airport" in German, is a minor international airport in Saarbrücken, the capital of the German state of Saarland. It features flights to major cities throughout Germany as well as some leisure routes.
History.
Foundation and early years.
The history of aviation in Saarbrücken, the capital of the German federal state Saarland, began on 17 September 1928 in the district of St. Arnual. Flights operated from Saarbrücken-St. Arnual Airport until 1939. The first plane to use the airport was a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt stopping en route to Paris. In 1929, routes to Frankfurt and on to Berlin and Karlsruhe and then to Munich, Vienna and Budapest were opened.
The airport's suboptimal location meant winter flights were not possible and bad weather and poor flying conditions caused frequent problems. Because of this, Saarbrücken-St. Arnual was closed in 1939. A new airport was built in the district of Ensheim. However, the outbreak of the Second World War made opening the airport impossible.
The airport in Ensheim finally opened in 1964 after several years of reconstruction. In 1972, Saarbrücken Airport became one of 17 airports in Germany to offer international flights.
Development in the 2000s.
In 2005, a record year, nearly 500,000 passengers used Saarbrücken Airport.
In 2006, Saarbrücken Airport suffered difficulties caused by the opening of a converted former military airport, Zweibrücken Airport, just approx. away. German leisure airline Hapagfly relocated from Saarbrücken and opened domestic routes in direct competition with Saarbrücken. In 2006, one day when Hapagfly flew from Heraklion to Saarbrücken, there were bad weather conditions at the airport. Pilots tried twice to land at Saarbrücken on a wet runway. They went on to land at Zweibrücken Airport. Following this incident, Hapagfly decided to relocate all their flights from Saarbrücken to Zweibrücken as Zweibrücken has a longer runway. In July 2014, it was reported that Zweibrücken Airport had filed for bankruptcy due to illegal subsidies as it is too close to Saarbrücken Airport, which has been in existence for much longer.
After Hapagfly left, Air Berlin opened routes from Saarbrücken to Palma de Mallorca and Berlin–Tegel Airport, but it ceased flying in 2017. Additionally, Luxair has made Saarbrücken Airport its secondary hub due to its proximity to Luxembourg.
Saarbrücken Airport handled 452,314 passengers in 2011.
Due to Zweibrücken Airport's financial difficulties, TUIfly announced that their seasonal base would be relocated from there to Saarbrücken Airport from summer 2015. Other airlines also moved their leisure flights from Zweibrücken to Saarbrücken for the 2015 summer season. As a result, the airport saw a significant increase in traffic compared to previous seasons.
Facilities.
Terminal.
Saarbrücken Airport consists of one passenger terminal building which features check-in-facilities as well as some shops and restaurants and a covered observation deck. The building is not equipped with jet bridges, therefore walk-boarding and bus-boarding is used. The apron right in front of the terminal features five aircraft stands which can accommodate mid-sized aircraft such as the Airbus A320.
Remote air traffic control.
Since 4 December 2018, air traffic control for the airport has been provided remotely from a remote tower centre in Leipzig (450 km away). The project had received funding from the SESAR Joint Undertaking under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 730195 and No 874470. The standard ATC systems are complemented with out-of-the-window 360° and 190° view, with pan-tilt-zoom cameras which can track objects like automatic binoculars, and infrared cameras which give more details during darkness. Sensors can track up to 256 objects in parallel. Despite the airport being controlled from a centre, with plans to control other airports (Erfurt in 2021 and Dresden later), one air traffic controller will provide service to one airport at a time, however the controllers will be cross-trained for the other airports as well.
Airlines and destinations.
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Saarbrücken Airport:
Ground transportation.
Car.
The airport is linked to the "A1"/"A6" motorways (Exit "Fechingen") which connect to Saarbrücken itself, to the cities of Trier and Mannheim and to Luxembourg. From France it can be reached via federal highway "L108". Taxis and car hire agencies are available at the terminal building.
Bus.
Regional bus line "R10" provides scheduled connections to Saarbrücken city center including Saarbrücken main station.

Zweibrücken Airport

Zweibrücken Airport , or "Flughafen Zweibrücken" in German, is a regional airport and former minor international airport in Zweibrücken, Germany. It was the smaller of the two passenger airports in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the other being Frankfurt-Hahn Airport. Zweibrücken currently only features general aviation, since scheduled air services ceased in November 2014 due to the airport's financial difficulties.
History.
Development into a civil airport.
Zweibrücken Airport is located on the site of the former Zweibrücken Air Base which was closed in 1991 following the end of Operation Desert Storm. The former site was reopened as a converted commercial airport on 1 September 1994.
In 2006, Germanwings began twice-daily service to Berlin Schönefeld Airport, but ceased them in 2011 due to expensive airports taxes. The airport also used to have regular scheduled service operated by Ryanair to London Stansted Airport. The service was announced on 27 May 2008, but ceased already one year later in May 2009. 264,247 passengers used the airport in 2010, decreasing to 242,880 passengers in 2012.
A twice per week service was operated between Zweibrücken and Antalya by Sky Airlines until the airline ceased operations due to financial problems in 2013. These flights were replaced by Atlasjet during summer 2013 season, and were taken over by Freebird Airlines for summer 2014. On 3 November 2013, Air Berlin stopped its weekly summer seasonal route to Palma de Mallorca on behalf of TUI, and were replaced by TUIfly and Germania for the 2014 summer season. In July 2014, TUIfly inaugurated the new seasonal route to Ankara, the airport's third destination in Turkey after Antalya and Istanbul. TUIfly operated eight routes out of Zweibrücken Airport, making it one of their focus cities.
Bankruptcy.
In July 2014, it was reported that the European Commission decided that up to 56 million Euros of subsidies for the airport were illegal and needed to be paid back. Due to this decision, on 24 July, Zweibrücken Airport filed for bankruptcy. One of the reasons for the Commission's decision is the close proximity to Saarbrücken Airport, which exists much longer.
While it was planned to keep the airport operating for general aviation operations, all commercial passenger operations were expected to cease by the end of the 2014 summer schedule. TUIfly decided to provide financial support for the airport to guarantee uninterrupted operations until the end of their summer schedule in November 2014.
However, in September 2014, TUIfly announced the closure of their Zweibrücken base as of 8 November 2014. As a replacement, several of their eight scheduled leisure routes, for example to Palma de Mallorca and Gran Canaria, will be relocated to nearby Saarbrücken Airport. Additionally, Pegasus Airlines' scheduled seasonal service to Istanbul ceased by 29 September 2014 without resumption in 2015. The few other remaining summer seasonal charter flights, for example those of Air VIA to Burgas, moved to Saarbrücken for the 2015 summer season as well.
The last scheduled flight took off from Zweibrücken at 13:40 p.m. on 3 November to Fuerteventura, also remaining as the last TUIfly operation at the airport and marking the closure of its focus city. Since that day, all scheduled operations at the airport ceased for the then upcoming entire winter season while most of the staff has been laid off due to a lack of funding to keep operations running.
Facilities.
Zweibrücken Airport features a small terminal building equipped with three aircraft stands next to it. As there are no jet bridges, walk-boarding is used. Before bankruptcy, the airport could handle mid-sized aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320 family.
Airlines and destinations.
All scheduled operations at Zweibrücken Airport ceased by 3 November 2014 due to a lack of funding for the upcoming winter season. The airport used to feature scheduled and charter flights to leisure destinations around the Mediterranean. There was no resumption of services for the 2015 summer season as all former airlines at Zweibrücken either terminated their services to the area, such as Pegasus Airlines, or relocated their routes to Saarbrücken instead.
The nearest other minor international airport is Saarbrücken Airport, approximately away.
Ground transportation.
Zweibrücken Airport is only accessible by road. It can be reached via motorway "A8" (exit "Contwig, Flughafen, Bitche (F)") which leads to Saarbrücken and Luxembourg and from France directly via federal highway "L700". Additionally, the local bus route "226" connects the airport with Zweibrücken city centre including Zweibrücken station.
Zweibrücken Circuit.
From 1996 to 1999, the airport held various Super Tourenwagen Cup, German F3, VW Beetle Cup and races but stopped hosting national championships due to financial reasons. 
The track has hosted the Historisches Flugplatzrennen, a historic car track day event, as recently as September 3rd 2023.
Lap records.

Hong Bao

Hong Bao (; "fl." "ca." 1412–1433) was a Chinese eunuch sent on overseas diplomatic missions during the reigns of the Yongle Emperor and Xuande Emperor of the Ming dynasty. He is best known as the commander of one of the detached squadrons of Zheng He's fleet during the seventh voyage to the Indian Ocean (1431–1433).
Early career.
According to the "History of Ming", in 1412 (i.e., some time between the third and fourth voyages of Zheng He's fleet), Hong Bao was sent by the Yongle Emperor as the envoy to Thailand.
In 1421 Hong Bao participated in the sixth voyage of Zheng He, during which foreign envoys were transported back to their countries, as far as Ormus.
Hong Bao on the Seventh Voyage of Zheng He.
Hong Bao's name appears in the made by Zheng He in Liujiagang in 1431, before his fleet left China on its 7th (and last) voyage to the "Western Ocean" (Indian Ocean). According to the inscription,
the two Principal Envoys (正使) sent by the Xuande Emperor to the countries of the Western Ocean were the eunuchs Zheng He and Wang Jinghong.
Hong Bao was one of the five Assistant Envoys (副使) (along with Zhu Liang, Zhou Man, Yang Zhen, and Zhang Da). Hong Bao, as well as all other Principal and Assistant Envoys except for Zhang Da, had the eunuch rank of Grand Director (太監, "Taijian").
Much of what we know about Hong Bao comes from the book written by the interpreter Ma Huan, who served in his squadron during the 7th voyage of Zheng He's fleet. According to Edward L. Dreyer's analysis of the preserved sources about the voyage, in particular Ma Huan's book, Hong Bao commanded a squadron which most likely separated from the main fleet in Semudera in northern Sumatra (although other suggested it may have happened earlier, in Qui Nhon in Champa), and visited Bengal. From Bengal, Hong Bao's squadron would then go to Calicut in southern India, to which the main fleet came directly from Semudera across the Bay of Bengal.
While the main fleet left Calicut to Ormus (in Persian Gulf), Hong Bao's squadron went from Calicut to various destinations on the west side of the Arabian Sea in southern Arabia and Horn of Africa, including Aden and Mogadishu. Before leaving Calicut, Hong Bao sent seven of his men, including Ma Huan, to Mecca and Medina with a ship from Calicut going to Jeddah.
Grave.
In June 2010, the Chief of Archaeology Department at Nanjing Museum Wang Zhigao announced that a Ming Dynasty grave
recently found near Zutang Mountain (祖堂山) in the Jiangning District of Nanjing was identified as that of Hong Bao (and not of Zheng He himself, as it was earlier surmised).

Vincent Haddelsey

Vincent Haddelsey (13 April 1934 – 29 August 2010) was an English naïve painter, who focused on landscapes and horses.
Early life.
Vincent Haddelsey was born in Bargate, Grimsby, England, on April 13, 1934. He was the only child of Sam Haddelsey, and Mary Lucy (nee Tierney). His father was a lawyer, and his grandfather and great-grandfather had also worked in the legal profession. At the end of the Second World War, the family moved to Canwick, a rural village just outside Lincoln. Canwick House had stables, and was surrounded by farms which still used shire horses for agricultural work, all of which taught him to look on horses as part of life. He attended the Catholic boarding school Ampleforth College in Yorkshire, England, and during the holidays enjoyed riding out with the Blankney Hunt and being on foot with the Cranwell Beagles, which led to his lifelong skill in horsemanship.
His two grandmothers were gifted painters, and when he was eight his maternal grandmother started him off with oils by giving him her own paint box, brushes and palette. He never had a formal art lesson, not even at school - he mostly taught himself.
Career.
When he was 18 Haddelsey emigrated to British Columbia, where he worked for several years in a construction camp, while struggling to paint in the winter. He became fascinated by the indigenous peoples and their collective folk art. This experience, which he described as a 'collective folk memory', led to his collaboration with the author Gordon Robinson in the production of "Tales of Kitamaat" (1956) for which Haddelsey provided the illustrations. This book was a collection of traditional stories told by the H'aisla people of British Columbia, collected by Robinson, himself a H'aisla, the hereditary Chief of the Beaver Clan.
In 1965 Haddelsey travelled to Mexico, where he intended to paint members of the Charros tribe. He took part in a rodeo and was as a result invited to become the member of a Mexican association of elite horsemen. He then moved to Paris where he established himself as an artist, and in 1969 won the International Grand Prix for naif painters at Lugano.
In 1971 Haddelsey published "The Horse, Our Heritage" which explored the equestrian world in some detail, from the Household Cavalry to polo. The book included a selection of Haddelsey's pictures, as well as his explanatory line drawings. In this collection, Haddelsey wrote the text himself, but for his next book he collaborated with equestrian author and journalist Caroline Silver to produce a 64-page showcase of his equestrian paintings. This was "Haddelsey's Horses: The Paintings of Vincent Haddelsey" (1978) consisting of full-page colour plates of his work, with a text provided by Silver. "Many of Haddelsey's paintings tell a story," writes Silver: one tells of a bull who wouldn't eat, who ends up on a pub sign, another tells of a ghost who hitches a ride home on a motorbike, then disappears (characteristically, horses feature in both paintings). 1978 was also the year of Haddelsey's marriage - to Caroline Silver (who had divorced her first husband in 1970).
In 1980, Vincent Haddelsey went on a journey to Inner Mongolia, where he studied and painted the Mongolian Pony. Various paintings resulted from this trip.
In 1989 Vincent travelled to Chile staying with his cousin Margaret Lunt (née Millen) whose husband John was stationed with the British Embassy as the Defence Attache. Vincent visited a number of Quasimodo horse gatherings and drew many sketches and pencil drawings of the riders and horses of Chile.
Preferring to be known as an "equestrian painter" rather than an artist, Haddelsey exhibited widely, and has paintings included in the Royal collection among others. He died on 29 August 2010 in Paris, having suffered from dementia during the final years of his life.

Surrey Theatre

The Surrey Theatre, London began life in 1782 as the Royal Circus and Equestrian Philharmonic Academy, one of the many circuses that provided entertainment of both horsemanship and drama (hippodrama). It stood in Blackfriars Road, near the junction with Westminster Bridge Road, just south of the River Thames in what is now the London Borough of Southwark.
History.
The "Royal Circus" was opened on 4 November 1782 by the composer and songwriter, Charles Dibdin (who coined the term "circus" for that usage), aided by Charles Hughes, a well-known equestrian performer. The entertainments were at first performed by children with the goal of its being a nursery for young actors. Delphini, a celebrated buffo, became manager in 1788 and produced a spectacle including a real stag-hunt. Other animal acts followed, including the popular dog act "Gelert and Victor", lecture pieces, pantomimes and local spectacles. The popular comedian John Palmer then managed the theatre until 1789, when he was committed to Horsemonger Lane Gaol as "a rogue and a vagabond".
It continued in use until 1810, although it had a troubled existence, being burnt down in 1799 and again on 12 August 1805. Rebuilt in 1806 by the German architect of the Old Vic, Rudolph Cabanel, it was converted into a theatre by Robert Elliston. He renamed it the Surrey Theatre, being determined to perform Shakespeare and other plays. He reopened on Easter Monday and to avoid trouble with the law, which did not allow dialogue to be spoken without musical accompaniment except at the two patent theatres, he put a ballet into every such production, including "Macbeth", "Hamlet", and Farquhar's "The Beaux' Stratagem". Contemporary reviewers noted that the Lambeth streets teemed with prostitutes.
Elliston left in 1814, and the Surrey became a circus again until Thomas Dibdin reopened it as a theatre in 1816. The arena where the equestrian exercises had been displayed was converted into a large pit for spectators, and the stables became saloons. Fanny Fitzwilliam and Sally Brook starred in melodramas, but the theatre had little success overall. John Baldwin Buckstone made his first London appearance at the theatre, on 30 January 1823, as Ramsay in "The Fortunes of Nigel". George Holland also appeared at the theatre, in 1826.
When Elliston returned in 1827, the theatre's fortunes changed. In 1829, Douglas Jerrold's melodrama "Black-Eyed Susan", with T. P. Cooke as "William", the nautical hero, ran for over 300 nights, which was extraordinarily successful for the time. Elliston made his last appearance at this theatre on 24 June 1831, twelve days before he died. Osbaldiston then took over and, among other plays, produced Edward Fitzball's "Jonathan Bradford; or, the Murder at the Roadside Inn", which ran for 260 nights. Productions of Dickens dramas, among others, followed. Ira Aldridge, the first successful black actor, appeared here in the 1840s. C. Z. Barnett's adaptation, "A Christmas Carol; or, The Miser's Warning" played in 1844. Richard Shepherd, who succeeded Alfred Bunn in 1848, remained at the theatre until 1869 and established its reputation for 'rough-and-tumble' transpontine melodrama.
On 29 January 1865, during the last scene of the pantomime "Richard Coeur de Lion", a fire began above the chandelier. The audience evacuated safely, but before the cast could leave the entire theatre was plunged into darkness, as the gas supervisor cut the gas supply to prevent an explosion. Panic ensued backstage, but the cast were led to safety through the burning scenery by the efforts of Green (acting manager), Rowella (the 'clown'), Evans (the 'pantaloon'), Vivian (the 'sprite') and others. The cast, still in their flimsy stage clothes, were conveyed to their lodgings in a fleet of cabs, provided by the police. In less than ten minutes the interior was ablaze, and the theatre was burnt down shortly after midnight.
A new theatre, designed by John Ellis, seating 2,161 people in four tiers, opened on 26 December 1865. Little of note took place until 1881, when George Conquest took over, staging melodramas, many of them written by himself, and pantomimes.
The Surrey flourished until his death in 1901. The theatre was remodelled by Kirk and Kirk, as a music hall, but did not prosper, becoming a cinema in 1920. It finally closed in 1924, and the building was demolished in 1934. The site is now occupied by modern flats.

Murder of Darrin Loving.
On October 29, 2024, Darrin Ray Loving, an 18 year-old black student who was disabled and attended special needs classes, was stabbed by another black student, 18 year-old Mac Brown Mbah Mbanwei, on the campus grounds of Manor Senior High School. The Manor Police Department was called to Manor Senior High School after the stabbing was reported to have taken place. The incident occurred around 12:45 PM CST on a Tuesday, and after many unsuccessful attempts from EMS to tend to Loving’s wounds and revive him, Loving succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead on the scene at 1:13 PM.
The incident was said to have occurred around lunchtime for the school and in the restroom of the school, in which Loving and Mbanwei got into a physical altercation according to witnesses. According to the witnesses who were near the bathroom at the time, both students got into an altercation which ended with Mbanwei mortally wounding the latter by stabbing him multiple times, around the neck area and his chest. Loving then began losing blood at an alarming rate and ran outside the bathroom into the halls, leaving a trail of blood before collapsing and succumbing to his wounds. Students who witnessed the altercation quickly began to yell and were in a state of panic after seeing Loving's corpse on the ground and the chaos caught the attention of the school's school resource officer, who was patrolling the lunchroom at the time. The officer began looking around for the perpetrator, and students redirected him to the boys' restroom in the cafeteria, where he had glanced into the restroom and saw Mbanwei with his hands in his pockets. The officer ordered Mbanwei to remove his hands from his pockets, to which he refused, and there was a physical struggle between the two until the officer had found a kitchen knife in Mbanwei's possession and seized the knife. Mbanwei was then arrested immediately after and was escorted outside the school.
Mbanwei was booked into the Travis County Jail and charged with first-degree murder, with a bond of $1 million. The district's superintendent has declined to share details about Mbanwei or Loving's behavioral records due to federal privacy laws. Mbanwei had a court hearing on November 18, during which, Judge Brandy Mueller, the presiding Judge of the 403rd Court District, ordered Mbanwei to be examined by an expert competency evaluator, to determine if the defendant is mentally competent to stand trial at this time. The next hearing was set for January 6, 2025.

Pasco Invitational

The Pasco Invitational is an annual track and field competition for high school athletes in the Pacific Northwest, held in mid April in Pasco, Washington.
The Invitational hosted its first event in 1962, ever since it has been the premier Track and Field event in the state of Washington. The Pasco Invitational features top high school athletes and teams from primarily Washington state with teams also competing from Oregon and other states. This track meet features better caliber competition than the WIAA State Track and Field Championships. This is because, at the Washington state meet, the best from each classification compete only against others in their classification. In the Pasco Invitational, all athletes compete against each other regardless of their school's classification/size; the competition is also deeper due to the additional out-of-state athletes who come to the Invite.
Most notable stars from the Pasco Invitational included Brad Walker, Ja'Warren Hooker, Anthony Buchanan, Chris Lukezic, and Ernie Conwell.

Sarah Gainham

Rachel Ames, née Stainer (London, 1 October 1915 – Petronell, Austria, 24 November 1999) was a British novelist and journalist who wrote under the pseudonym Sarah Gainham. She is perhaps best known for her 1967 novel "Night Falls on the City", the first of a trilogy about life in Vienna under Nazi rule.
Life.
Rachel Stainer was born in Islington, London. After her father Tom died in the First World War, the family moved to Newbury, Berkshire.
After an "impulsive and unsuccessful wartime liaison", in 1947 she moved to Vienna, Austria, to work with the Four Power Commission, and married the journalist Antony Terry. Terry was German correspondent for "The Sunday Times", and the marriage "fell victim to his workload".
Stainer never returned to England, living in Berlin, Bonn and Trieste before returning to Vienna. In 1956, Cyril Ray helped secure her a job as Central and Eastern Europe Correspondent for "The Spectator", making a plea that she needed the money. Writing as Sarah Gainham (the name of her maternal great-grandmother), she reported on Germany and the German-speaking parts of Central Europe until 1966. She soon published her first novel, "Time Right Deadly" (1956), a semi-autobiographical account of an unsuccessful affair. The novel was followed by several other spy thrillers set in Europe. Here Gainham drew on her own knowledge of Cold War spies and intrigues: Terry, hired to "The Sunday Times" by Ian Fleming, may have been an MI6 agent, and Gainham herself apparently researched a document 'East-West Routes for Agents', commissioned by Fleming, on how to gain access to West Berlin from East Berlin.
In 1964, her marriage to Terry was dissolved, and she married Kenneth Ames, Central European correspondent of "The Economist". 
Gainham's 1967 book "Night Falls on the City", a tale of love and betrayal set in wartime Vienna, achieved significant commercial success: it topped the "New York Times" bestseller list for several months, and was widely translated. It was the first novel of a trilogy, completed by "A Place in the Country" (1969) and "Private Worlds" (1971), and gave her financial security.
In 1975, Ames committed suicide, leaving Gainham alone in later life. In 1976, she moved from Vienna to a small house in Petronell-Carnuntum, on the banks of the Danube, and became a somewhat eccentric recluse. Her last novel was the heavily autobiographical but unsuccessful "The Tiger, Life" (1983). In 1984, she was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. "A Discursive Essay on the Presentation of Recent History in England" was privately published in 1999.

Telex (input method)

Telex or TELEX (), is a convention for encoding Vietnamese text in plain ASCII characters. Originally used for transmitting Vietnamese text over telex systems, it is one of the most used input method on phones and touchscreens and also computers. Vietnamese Morse code uses the TELEX system. Other systems include VNI and VIQR. 
History.
The Telex input method is based on a set of rules for transmitting accented Vietnamese text over telex () first used in Vietnam during the 1920s and 1930s. Telex services at the time ran over infrastructure that was designed overseas to handle only a basic Latin alphabet, so a message reading "" ("the dam broke") could easily be misinterpreted as "" ("the wife is giving birth"). , a prominent journalist and translator, is credited with devising the original set of rules for telex systems.
In later decades, common computer systems came with largely the same limitations as the telex infrastructure, namely inadequate support for the large number of characters in Vietnamese. Mnemonics like Telex and Vietnamese Quoted-Readable (VIQR) were adapted for these systems. As a variable-width character encoding, Telex represents a single Vietnamese character as one, two, or three ASCII characters. By contrast, a byte-oriented code page like VISCII takes up only one byte per Vietnamese character but requires specialized software or hardware for input.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Telex was adopted as a way to type Vietnamese on standard English keyboards. Specialized software converted Telex keystrokes to either precomposed or decomposed Unicode text as the user typed. VietStar was the first such software package to support this entry mode. The Bked editor by extended Telex with commands such as codice_1, codice_2 for "ư", and codice_3 for "ơ". It was further popularized with the input method editors VietKey, Vietres, and VPSKeys. In 1993, the use of Telex as an input method was standardized in Vietnam as part of TCVN 5712.
In the 2000s, Unicode largely supplanted language-specific encodings on modern computer systems and the Internet, limiting Telex's use in text storage and transmission. However, it remains the default input method for many input method editors, with VIQR and VNI offered as alternatives. It also continues to supplement international Morse Code in Vietnamese telegraph transmissions.
Starting with Windows 10 version 1903, TELEX, along with the VNI input method, are now natively supported.
Rules.
Because the Vietnamese alphabet uses a complex system of diacritical marks, Telex requires the user to type in a base letter, followed by one or two characters that represent the diacritical marks. Telex takes advantage of the quirks and limitations of Vietnamese orthography to insert diacritics. Since the letters "f", "w", "z", and "j" do not exist in Vietnamese, Telex assigns diacritics to their corresponding keys, allowing users to type as codice_4. Despite "r", "s", and "x" being part of the Vietnamese alphabet, they cannot directly follow vowel letters in orthography. Nevertheless, Telex utilises these letters to input diacritics as well.
To write the pair of keys as two distinct characters, the second character has to be repeated. For example, the Vietnamese word must be entered as codice_5 rather than codice_6 (*).
If more than one tone marking key is pressed, the last one will be used. For example, typing codice_7 will return "a". (Thus "z" can also be used to delete diacritics when using an input method editor.) To write a tone marking key as a normal character, one has to press it twice: codice_8 becomes , while codice_9 becomes .

Chorvátsky Grob

Chorvátsky Grob (, , ) is a village and municipality in western Slovakia in Senec District in the Bratislava region. It has a population of around 6,000 people.
The village's name Chorvátsky means Croatian. This refers to the Croatian people that have lived in the area since the early 16th century. This population arrived here after escaping the area between Sisak and Kostajnica during the Ottoman Wars. The area was settled by Croatians escaping from Turkish Ottoman raids which helps explain the etymology of the present-day name from "Horvát Gurab" to "Chorvátsky Grob" (Croatian Grave) used at the present time.
According to the local municipality website of Chorvátsky Grob the Slovak word for "grob" is " hrob" or, in English "grave". Reportedly, this place was named in memory of soldiers, though it is not clear if those soldiers were Croats, Slovaks or another ethnicity.

Reca

Reca () is a village and municipality in western Slovakia in Senec District in the Bratislava Region.
Geography.
The municipality lies at an altitude of 124 metres and covers an area of 9.921 km². It has a population of 1420 people.
History.
Pagan tomb-mounds excavated in an around Reca confirm the presence of Magyar mounted border guards from the 10th century.
In historical records the village was first mentioned in 1256, and was part of the dominion of Matthias Csák, the magnate of Trencsén. Documents confirm that before Csak, during the reign of the early Árpád kings, the settlement was inhabited by castle warriors () and controlled by the Count of Pozsony. The castle warriors of Reca developed into landowning lower nobility and Reca was a characteristic curial village of Pozsony County until the mid-20th century.
During the Counter-Reformation in the 16th and 17th centuries, Reca (or Réthe, as it was then known) became the shelter of Bohemian and Moravian Protestants after the Battle of the White Mountain, because the Reca gentry was not subject to Catholic Habsburg religious laws. An estimated five-sixths of the Bohemian nobility went into exile soon after the Battle of White Mountain, and their properties were confiscated. This period has left a Unity of the Brethren Chapel in the village, containing pieces of rare ecclesiastical plate. After the city of Skalica, Reca was one of the most significant locations in Royal Hungary for Czech exiles, with approximately 30 families settling there in the 17th century.
In 1878 Reca briefly became known as Nemes Réte, in line with some other curial villages (e.g. Nemes Dedina. It also adopted a peculiar coat of arms consisting of the Royal arms of Hungary).
The 1892 Directory of Hungarian Merchants (which covers roughly 10-15% of the working populace of the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary) lists the heads of families in Reca engaged in trade. It mainly covers Jewish families living in Reca as craftsmen and shopkeepers, and heads of gentry families engaged in horse-breeding which they subsequently sold in nearby Senec, Bratislava or Vienna. The largest families in the list are the Doka (7 [and long-serving representatives of the noble commune of Reca]), Fadgyas (3), Karátsonyi (4), Klebercz (3), Pomichal (6) and Prikkel (3).
During the First Vienna Award in 1938, Reca once more became part of Hungary, during the regime of admiral Miklós Horthy. In 1945 it was recovered by Czechoslovakia. A number of residents were affected by the Benes Decrees and tenthousands of Hungarian families were forced to move to Hungary and Czechia in 1947 as part of the colonisation of Slovaks in the region.
Notable figures.
The first individual known to documented history is Petrus Magnus de Réthe, a descendant of the original castle warriors, recorded in 1256 as a castle warrior of Bratislava Castle.
A 1395 document records John and Peter of Reca as having been (or royal judges) during the reign of Louis I of Hungary (1326-1382).
In 1485, another John of Reca is recorded as judge () of Pozsony County.
Nicholas of Reca was canon and vice-dean, and from 1489 to 1499 dean of the Chapter of Bratislava.
Between 1504 and 1540, Andreas de Réthe was viscount () of Pozsony County (Bratislava).
In the 17th century Péter Réthey was a "familiaris" (a Hungarian type of vassalage) of the Báthory family, whose members were Kings of Poland and Princes of Transylvania at the time. In 1620 he gained the manor of Füzérradvány from Elisabeth Báthory and her husband Ferenc Nádasdy. Péter Réthey constructed a large fortified seat which today remains one of the largest in Hungary.
A notable 18th-century historical figure of Reca was György Réthey, a former Imperial cavalry officer who fought for Francis II Rákóczi, Prince of Transylvania and leader of the last major uprising of the Hungarian nobility against the Habsburg dynasty (see Rákóczi's War for Independence). Both György Réthey and his brother János defected from Imperial service and commanded hussar regiments under Rákóczi. In 1706, György Réthey led 3,000 men on an infamous attack on Styria, designed to plunder and pillage the local populace. 92 villages, two towns, and several castles were burned during the raid. He also commanded his regiment at the Battle of Trencsén in 1708.
Ferenc Réthey, another eminent supporter of Rákóczi, was, amongst other activities, captain of the medieval Szécsény castle (which was destroyed after the uprising), captain of Sirok castle and, towards the end of his career, captain of Eger fortress and Heves County. On 8 December 1710 Ferenc Réthey and Miklós Perényi capitulated Eger to the Habsburg field-marshal Count Johann Pálffy. It is unclear how closely Ferenc Réthey was related to György Réthey, as prior to the 19th century members of Reca nobility often used only their predicate of "Réthey" or "de Réthe" (meaning 'of Reca') in correspondence and identification, and not their original family names which distinguish individual family lines.
László Dóka was főszolgabíró (Chief Constable) of Pozsony County from 1837 and deputy Judex Curiae Regi (the Lord Chief Justice of Hungary) in the first half of the 19th century, and Sándor Dóka was acting Governor of Pozsony County at the beginning of the 20th.
Marián Réthei Prikkel (1871-1925), a cleric, compiled the first substantial collection of Hungarian folk dances. He also published one of the first monographs on the important early medieval Hungarian manuscript, the Pray Codex.
Ferenc Réthey (1880-1952), a jurist and academic, was Count (Lord Lieutenant) of Moson County.
Richárd Pomichal (1951-2010), was a well-known and popular Hungarian writer, teacher and biologist, who published widely on the ecology of the Csallóköz (Rye Island, Inselschutt) region, as well as writing on Hungarian history and the effects of the Trianon Treaty.
István Pomichal (1965, Reca), an agriculturalist, is a member of parliament and the autonomous Bratislava region for the Party of the Hungarian Coalition, a party for the Hungarian minority in Slovakia Pomichal's pedigree cattle, bred on an estate in Tomášov, has won a number of national and international gold prizes in Slovakia and Hungary.
Historical descriptions.
Matthias Bel: "The inhabitants are Hungarians, and not rustics: indeed, they are people both of noble birth and character (manners). They bread they eat is excellent and hospitality takes the first place there. They are proud of their ample herds and satisfied with the fruit of their farming." 
Vályi, András (1796): "Hungarian village in Bratislava Castle County. Lord County Pálffy is the greatest landowner. The inhabitants are Catholics and Protestants, and the village is occupied by a number of nobles. It is half a mile from Puszta Födémes. The burghers of Bratislava send their young children to the village to learn the Hungarian language."
Fényes, Elek (1851): "Réthe, a populous Hungarian village in Bratislava Castle County, one hour east of Szencz. 491 Catholics, 49 Evangelical, 337 Reformed, 149 Jews. With a Reformed and Catholic church, and a synagogue. Large limits boundaries and beautiful expanse of fertile meadows, vast pastures, famous for sheep and cattle market. Many landowning nobles. One street leads to Cseklesz."
Liszka, József (2003): "The squires of Reca formed an individual group in the Matyusfold region. This social class of the village, which consisted of both Reformed and Catholics, was wealthier than the average. Their wealth was clear because their dwellings looked like manor houses, they employed liveried coachmen and they sent their children to schools in Bratislava from the 19th century. Reca noble families were also distinctive for their behaviour and mentality. "The necessary honourable elegance and a keeping of a certain distance" remained alive even after there was no longer any justification of property, i.e. in the second half of the 20th century."
References in popular culture.
Reca is the setting for the epic Hungarian film (1954), or "Rákóczi's Lieutenant" in English. The heroic officer in the film, Lieutenant János Bornemissza, is driven by his "patriotism to Hungary and love for the beautiful Anna Bíró from Reca". When Reca falls into "labanc" hands Anna is imprisoned and only rescued by Bornemissza at the end of the film.

Mark Gottfried

Mark Frederick Gottfried (born January 20, 1964) is an American former men's college basketball coach, basketball podcaster, and former player who most recently served as head coach of the Cal State Northridge Matadors.
Gottfried played one season at Oral Roberts and three seasons at Alabama, advancing to the Sweet Sixteen in each of his seasons with the Crimson Tide. He spent eight seasons as an assistant coach at UCLA, including the team's 1995 NCAA championship season, three years as head coach at Murray State, eleven years as head coach at Alabama, and six seasons at North Carolina State.
Early years.
Gottfried was born in Crestline, Ohio. He played varsity basketball at Carterville High School in Carterville, Illinois, and Carbondale Community High School in Carbondale, Illinois. He then played for UMS Prep (now known as UMS-Wright Preparatory School) in Mobile, Alabama, during his senior year, averaging 21.6 ppg/11.2 rpg before graduating in 1982. As a student, he was selected to the National Honor Society. Gottfried was inducted into UMS-Wright's Hall of Fame and in 2004, was the UMS Alumnus of the Year.
College career.
Gottfried attended Oral Roberts on a basketball scholarship. After playing there for one season, where he was a Freshman All-American, he transferred to Alabama. There, he started 98 consecutive games, and Alabama advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in all three seasons he played. He holds the school records for most 3-point shots made in a single game with eight in a 1987 game against Vanderbilt, and for career 3-point field goal percentage (.485, 81–167). Gottfried graduated with a Bachelor of Arts &amp; Sciences in Communications from the University of Alabama in 1987, after winning both the school's Hayden Riley Top Scholar Award and the Bryant Award as the school's top scholar-athlete during his senior year. He was selected by the Detroit Pistons in the seventh round of the 1987 NBA draft, though he never played professionally. Instead, he spent three years touring with Athletes in Action, then attended UCLA graduate school for two years.
Coaching career.
UCLA.
Gottfried served as an assistant coach for eight seasons (1988–95) at UCLA under Jim Harrick. Other members of the staff were former St. John's and UCLA head coach Steve Lavin and former Washington head coach Lorenzo Romar. The Bruins were the 1995 NCAA champions with Gottfried as an assistant coach and recruiter. The Bruins were ranked 1st nationally for their recruiting class in 1994 and produced future NBA players Ed O'Bannon, George Zidek, Tyus Edney, Don MacLean, Tracy Murray, Trevor Wilson, Darrick Martin and Mitchell Butler. Gottfried faced his former school twice as head coach at Alabama, losing 79–57 in the 2001 John Wooden Classic and losing 62–59 in the second round of the 2006 NCAA tournament.
Murray State.
Gottfried was head coach from 1995 to 1998 at Murray State University and compiled a 68–24 overall record. Murray State advanced to the NCAA tournament in 1997 and again in 1998 and made the NIT in his first season there in 1996. He coached the Racers to Ohio Valley Conference championships in each of his seasons as head coach, becoming the first head coach to win three OVC titles in only three seasons. In his last season, the Racers finished 25th in the final AP Poll.
Alabama.
Gottfried was hired by the University of Alabama on March 25, 1998. He led the Tide to the SEC regular season championship in the 2001–02 season, their first regular-season title in 15 years. The following year, his team became the first in Crimson Tide history to be ranked No. 1 in the AP poll. The team held the ranking for two weeks before losing 51–49 to Utah shortly before conference play. During the end of the following season, his team upset top-ranked and top-seeded Stanford in the second round of the NCAA tournament. The squad then defeated reigning national champion Syracuse to advance to the Elite Eight, achieving another program first. The Tide ultimately lost to eventual national champion UConn. For his efforts, Gottfried was named SEC coach of the year by the AP and his fellow coaches. The next season, Alabama entered the NCAA tournament as a fifth seed before suffering a first-round loss to UW–Milwaukee.
After that, his tenure at Alabama was marked by key player injuries and disappointment. Alabama posted back-to-back losing seasons in the SEC in 2006–07 and 2007–08. The 2007–08 season marked the first time in nine years (only the second time under Gottfried) that Alabama did not reach either the NIT or NCAA post-season tournament, although the Tide did receive an invitation to the first annual College Basketball Invitational, which it did not accept. On January 26, 2009, after the controversial departure of player Ronald Steele and an underperforming season at that point, Gottfried met with Alabama Athletics Director Mal Moore and resigned mid-season.
NC State.
On April 5, 2011, Gottfried accepted the job as head coach of the NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team. To celebrate the upcoming basketball season, Gottfried planned to perform a tandem skydive into Carter Finley Stadium during halftime of a football game. The jump, scheduled for September 17, 2011, was canceled due to weather concerns.
On March 11, 2012, the NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team received an 11th seed in the NCAA tournament. Because his team was selected into the tournament, Gottfried received a two-year extension on his contract through April 4, 2018. On March 18, 2012, Gottfried's 11th-seeded Wolfpack team defeated the 3rd-seeded Georgetown Hoyas in the 3rd round of the NCAA Tournament, earning a Sweet 16 berth. Five days later, the Wolfpack lost to 2nd-seeded Kansas Jayhawks in the Sweet 16.
On January 12, 2013, Gottfried became just the 14th coach in history to beat the #1 ranked team in the country with two separate schools after beating Duke 84–76 (having previously done so at Alabama).
During the 2014–2015 season, NC State picked up wins against two Top 10 conference opponents (Jan 11 vs Duke and Feb 14 vs Louisville). Both Top 10 victories came immediately after losses to the ACC leading Virginia Cavaliers. The road victory against the Louisville Cardinals was only the third time since the turn of the century that the Wolfpack had picked up a road win vs. an AP Top 10 squad, snapping a 22-game drought in such games. NC State would qualify for the NCAA Tournament as an 8 seed eliminating the top seeded Villanova Wildcats before falling to number 4 seed Louisville Cardinals in the Sweet 16 Gottfried's second in 4 years with the Wolfpack. However it would be Gottfried's last winning season in Raleigh.
On January 23, 2017, Gottfried earned his 400th career win as a head coach by defeating #17 Duke in an 84–82 thriller at Cameron Indoor Stadium. It was the first time since January 1995 that NC State had won at Duke.
After two losing consecutive seasons, including going 9–27 in the ACC during those seasons and several transfers out, Gottfried was on the hot seat.
On February 16, 2017, after a meeting between Gottfried and athletic director Debbie Yow, NC State announced that Gottfried would not return as head coach for the following season.
In July 2019, the NCAA charged NC State with a series of violations regarding the recruitment of former star Dennis Smith Jr. They included two Level I violations against Gottfried, including failure to control the program and failure to monitor assistant Orlando Early, who was accused of facilitating payments to Smith. In December 2021, the NCAA placed NC State on one year of probation for the violations and ordered the Wolfpack to vacate all of its wins in 2016–17. It also slapped Gottfried with a one-year show-cause penalty, effective until December 19, 2022. If Gottfried works at another NCAA member school during this period, that school must show why Gottfried must not be sanctioned. Early was hit with a six-year show-cause penalty.
Dallas Mavericks.
Gottfried joined the Dallas Mavericks as an assistant coach for their 2017 NBA Summer League team. The Mavericks had drafted Dennis Smith Jr., who played for Gottfried at NC State for one season, in the 2017 NBA draft.
Cal State Northridge.
Gottfried was hired as head coach of Cal State Northridge on March 12, 2018. The infractions case at NC State was announced shortly after the end of Gottfried's first season, leading Yahoo! Sports' Pat Forde to recall that CSU Northridge's decision to hire him had been much criticized. In April 2021, CSU Northridge placed Gottfried and his staff on leave amid an internal investigation into potential rules violations in the basketball program. He never returned; he and CSU Northridge mutually agreed to part ways in December 2021, shortly after he was handed a show-cause penalty for the violations at NC State. Had Gottfried returned, CSU Northridge would have had to convince the NCAA that Gottfried should not be sanctioned, and could have been severely punished had he committed additional violations while his show-cause order was in effect. Trent Johnson was named interim coach for the 2021–22 season, and won the job on a permanent basis after the season.
Family.
Gottfried is divorced and the father of four sons and one daughter. His oldest son, Brandon, was a standout athlete at Gulf Shores High School (Gulf Shores, Alabama) in both football and basketball and graduated from Stanford University, where he played football as a tight end. His daughter, Mary Layson, is an accomplished international fashion model. His father, Joe Gottfried, is a former NCAA Southern Illinois Univ-Carbondale basketball coach and retired as director of athletics at the University of South Alabama in 2009. His uncle, Mike Gottfried, was a college football head coach (Murray State, Cincinnati, Kansas and Pittsburgh) and an analyst on ESPN college football broadcasts.

History.
Archaeological digs show that the area around Kaplna was first settled around 5000 BC. The first written reference to the village comes from a document signed by the Hungarian king Bela IV in 1244 AD as "Capulna".
The name of the village was derived from a unique wo-tower Catholic church built in Romanesque architecture sometimes in the first half of the eleventh century. The church walls were not plastered, showing its bright red bricks. Later, the church was rebuilt in early Gothic style, and after a 1634 fire it has been rebuilt with only one tower. In the eighteenth century the church interior was rebuilt in Baroque style. In 1960, an archaeological dig uncovered the original Romanesque porch and windows.

Keshan disease

Keshan disease is a congestive cardiomyopathy caused by a combination of dietary deficiency of selenium and the presence of a mutated strain of Coxsackievirus, named after Keshan County of Heilongjiang province, Northeast China, where symptoms were first noted. These symptoms were later found prevalent in a wide belt extending from northeast to southwest China, all due to selenium-deficient soil. The disease peaked in 1960–1970, killing thousands of people.
Often fatal, the disease affects children and women of child-bearing age, characterized by heart failure and pulmonary edema. Over decades, supplementation with selenium reduced this condition.
It had been linked to the coxsackie B virus. Current research suggests that the lack of selenium results in a more virulent strain of the coxsackievirus becoming the dominant viral species present in the population of virus, but the mechanism of this selection event is unclear.
Keshan disease can also lead to higher rates of cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and strokes. In addition, an individual can experience eczema, psoriasis, arthritis, cataracts, alcoholism, and infections.
Signs and symptoms.
There are four main types of Keshan disease: acute, subacute, chronic, and latent. 
Some signs and symptoms of acute Keshan disease include dizziness, malaise, nausea, chills, loss of appetite, projectile vomiting, pallor, low arterial blood pressure (less than 80/60 mmHg), dyspnea, precardiac (anterior to the heart) or substernal (behind or below the sternum) discomfort, cardiogenic shock, and constricted veins in one's extremities.
Some signs and symptoms of subacute Keshan disease include malaise, restlessness, gallop rhythm, facial edema, heart dilation, and cardiac shock.
Some signs and symptoms of chronic Keshan disease include palpitations, dyspnea, cough (with blood), pain in one's right upper quadrant, edema, oliguria, enlargement of the heart, systolic murmur, gallop rhythm, and hepatomegaly.
Some signs and symptoms of latent Keshan disease include dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, and mild enlargement of the heart.
Treatments.
The treatment for Keshan disease is selenium supplementation. The recommended amounts are fifty-five micrograms of selenium per day for adult men and women, sixty micrograms a day for women during pregnancy and seventy micrograms per day for women after pregnancy. A doctor may insist that if a man is sexually active, he may have to take up to seventy micrograms of selenium per day. A doctor may also recommend that the individual take vitamin E; selenium and vitamin E are medically linked and seem to work together. An individual will also be advised to have a diet that includes seafood, meats such as kidney, and liver, and some grains and seeds; all of these are high in selenium. Brewer's yeast and wheat germ both contain high levels of selenium. Garlic, onions, mushroom, broccoli, tomatoes, radishes, and Swiss chard may be good sources of selenium if the soil in which they are grown contains it. An individual will have to be monitored once they begin to take the selenium supplements, due to the fact that too much of it can cause balding, intestinal distress, weakness, and slow mental functioning. Individuals in China with the disease treat it with a herb called "Astragalus", which accumulates selenium from the soil.
Living with Keshan disease.
An individual will most likely be prescribed selenium supplements (in the form of selenomethionine) or have injections of this mineral. Other recommendations for managing Keshan disease are to increase consumption of foods rich in selenium in addition to supplements, avoid alcohol, monitor side effects to medications, and increase sleep. Cardiac surgery (implants, stents or full heart transplant) may be advised.
