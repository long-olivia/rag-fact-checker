USS Chevalier (DD-805)

USS "Chevalier" (DD/DDR-805) was a of the United States Navy, the second Navy ship named for Lieutenant Commander Godfrey DeC. Chevalier (1889–1922), a pioneer of naval aviation.
"Chevalier" was launched 29 October 1944 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. G. DeC. Chevalier; and commissioned 9 January 1945. She was ordered as a radar picket destroyer. Her mid-section torpedo tubes were removed to make room for a second radar mast and aft torpedo tubes were replaced with quad mounted 40 mm Bofors AA guns to protect her against Kamikaze attacks.
History.
"Chevalier" cleared Guantanamo Bay 18 June 1945, and reached Pearl Harbor 9 July. On the 24th, she sailed to join in the bombardment of Wake on 1 August, arriving at Eniwetok next day. She joined Task Force 38 (TF 38) off Honshū 18 August, and with her force entered Tokyo Bay 26 August. After patrol and escort assignments supporting occupation activities in the Marianas and Philippines, "Chevalier" sailed from Saipan 25 March 1946 for San Diego, arriving 11 April.
Before the Korean War, "Chevalier" completed tours of duty in the western Pacific in 1946–7, and 1948–9, and maintained her readiness through local operations from San Diego. On 18 March 1949, she was reclassified DDR-805, a radar picket destroyer, and during the summer and fall of 1949 operated in the Hawaiian Islands. During the Korean War, she served actively in the Far East between 6 July 1950 and 25 March 1951; 15 October 1951 and 31 May 1952: and 2 January 1953 and 22 August 1953. Her duty during the major portion of each tour was to join the protective screen of TF 77, the carrier force which launched almost continuous raids on North Korea. She also sailed on protective patrol in the Taiwan Straits.
"Chevalier"s post-war operating schedule alternated tours of duty with the guardian 7th Fleet with necessary overhaul and training activities along the west coast. In 1954, 1955, 1956–57, 1957–58, 1958–59, and 1960, she sailed for the visits to Far Eastern and Australian ports, patrol duty in the Taiwan Straits, and exercises off Japan, Okinawa, and in the Philippines which are a part of Far Eastern deployment.
"Chevalier"s classification reverted to DD-805 13 July 1962.
1971, Vietnam shore bombardment North and South Vietnam, yankee station Vietnam. Helped in the mining of Haiphong Harbor, (Operation Pocket Money, the mining campaign against principal North Vietnamese ports, was launched on 9 May 1972.)
ROKS "Chung Buk".
"Chevalier" was transferred to South Korea on 5 July 1972. She served in the Republic of Korea Navy as ROKS "Chung Buk". She was sold for scrap and dismantled in December 2000.
Awards.
"Chevalier" received one battle star for World War II service, and nine for Korean War service.

Izak catshark

The Izak catshark or simply Izak (Holohalaelurus regani) is a species of shark belonging to the family Pentanchidae, the deepwater catsharks. This species is common off the coasts of South Africa and southern Namibia. It typically inhabits the outer continental shelf at depths of , with the males found deeper than the females and juveniles. The Izak catshark has a short, wide, flattened head and a robust body tapering to a long, slender tail. It can be identified by its ornate color pattern of dark brown spots (in juveniles) or reticulations and blotches (in adults) on a light yellowish background, as well as by the enlarged dermal denticles over its pectoral fins and along its dorsal midline from the snout to the second dorsal fin. This species reaches in length, with the males larger than females.
Bottom-dwelling and perhaps relatively active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a diverse array of bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs two at a time year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.
Taxonomy.
The Izak catshark was originally described by South African ichthyologist John Gilchrist in a 1922 fisheries survey report. He assigned the new species to the genus "Scylliorhinus", and gave it the specific epithet "regani" in honor of fellow ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan. In 1934, Henry Weed Fowler assigned this species to his newly created "Holohalaelurus", a subgenus of "Halaelurus". "Holohalaelurus" has since been elevated to the rank of full genus. As there do not appear to be any existing type specimens referable to Gilchrist's account, in 2006 Brett Human designated a long male caught in Hondeklip Bay as the species neotype.
Historically, there has been much confusion in the scientific literature between "H. regani", "H. punctatus", and "H. melanostigma", the last of which at various times had been considered a junior synonym of "H. regani" and was itself confounded with "H. grennian". Furthermore, two forms of "H. regani" were once recognized: the "Cape" or "typical" form and the "Natal" or "northeastern" form. The latter "northeastern" form was described as a separate species, "H. favus", in 2006.
Description.
The body of the Izak catshark is firm and stout, tapering dramatically towards the tail. The head is very short, wide, and flattened, with a blunt snout. The horizontally oval eyes are placed high on the head and have thick ridges beneath; each has a rudimentary nictitating membrane and is followed by a spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by triangular flaps of skin that almost reach the long, angular mouth. The mouth contains prominent papillae on both the roof and the floor, and lacks furrows at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain on average 65 and 60 tooth rows respectively; each tooth is relatively large, with a narrow central cusp flanked by 1–2 smaller cusplets. There are five pairs of gill slits.
The pectoral fins are rather long and broad. The first dorsal fin originates over the rear of the pelvic fin bases; the second dorsal fin is slightly larger and originates over the rear of the anal fin base. The pelvic and anal fins are long and low, and larger than the dorsal fins. The free rear tips of the pelvic fins may be fused together to some degree, but never completely; males have slender, pointed claspers. The caudal peduncle is long and thin, particularly in younger sharks. The caudal fin makes up one-fourth to one-fifth of the total length and has a weak lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The thick skin is covered by well-calcified dermal denticles, except around the gill slits. Enlarged, spike-like denticles are found on the upper surface of the pectoral fins and along the dorsal midline from the snout to the second dorsal fin origin. Juvenile Izak catsharks are boldly patterned with many irregularly shaped dark brown spots on a light yellow to yellowish brown background. The spots enlarge and fuse with age to form an intricate pattern of reticulations and U-shaped markings in adults. The underside is plain white, with obvious black sensory pores beneath the head, body, and paired fins. Like other "Holohalaelurus" species, but contrary to the pattern in most cartilaginous fishes, males attain a much greater maximum length than females: versus .
Distribution and habitat.
Endemic to the southern tip of Africa, the range of the Izak catshark extends from Lüderitz, Namibia in the west to Durban, South Africa in the east. Older records further north along the East African coast (e.g. Somalia) most likely refer to other "Holohalaelurus" species. This abundant, bottom-dwelling species inhabits the outer continental shelf and upper continental slope, from to at least deep. Off South Africa, it is most common in areas with a wider continental shelf, and at depths of off the south coast and off the west coast. Females and juveniles tend to be found in shallower water than males. For the most part, the number of sharks in a given area remains largely constant throughout the year. However, sharks at the southernmost point of the Agulhas Bank may perform a small autumn migration towards the shore.
Biology and ecology.
Compared to other deep-sea sharks, the Izak catshark has a large heart suggestive of a relatively active lifestyle. It is a generalist that feeds on a wide variety of bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods; larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans and fewer fishes. At least some part of its recorded diet probably represents scavenging from fishery discards, given the presence of fast-moving, pelagic species that the shark is unlikely to have captured live. Polychaete worms, hydrozoans, gastropods, and hagfish eggs may also be occasionally ingested. This species often has nematode and flatworm parasites in its stomach.
The Izak catshark is oviparous and reproduction proceeds throughout the year without seasonal patterns. Mature females have a single functional ovary and two functional oviducts; a single egg matures within each oviduct at a time. Each egg is contained within a purse-shaped capsule long and across. The capsule is light brown with long tendrils at the four corners that likely serve to anchor it to rocks; its surface has a velvet-like texture and bears lengthwise striations. The rate of egg laying is unknown but thought to be high, based on this shark's resilience to fishing pressure. The preponderance of females and juveniles at shallower depths may indicate that such waters serve as nursery areas. The young hatch at under long. Males and females mature sexually at and long respectively.
Human interactions.
The Izak catshark is harmless and of no commercial value. It is regularly caught incidentally (and discarded) by a bottom trawl fishery targeting hake south of Cape Town. In contrast to most cartilaginous fishes, its numbers have been increasing in the presence of commercial fishing. The reasons for this may include its high reproductive rate, its breeding in less-fished shallower waters, its hardiness allowing for high post-capture survival, and its opportunistic diet. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has consequently listed the Izak catshark under Least Concern, while still noting that it merits continued population monitoring because of its highly restricted range.

Neck ring

Neck rings, or neck-rings, are any form of stiff jewellery worn as an ornament around the neck of an individual, as opposed to a loose necklace. Many cultures and periods have made neck rings, with both males and females wearing them at various times. Neck rings that are rarely or never removed are a type of permanent jewellery.
Of the two most notable types, one is the torc, an often heavy and valuable ornament normally open at the throat. These were worn by various early cultures but are especially associated with the ancient Celts of the European Iron Age, where they were evidently a key indicator of wealth and status, mostly worn by men.
The other type is one or more spiral metal coils of many turns, often worn only by married women.
Illusion of elongation.
In a few African and Asian cultures, neck rings are worn usually to create the appearance that the neck has been stretched.
The custom of wearing neck rings is related to an ideal of beauty: an elongated neck. Neck rings push the clavicle and ribs down. The neck stretching is mostly illusory: the weight of the rings twists the collarbone and eventually the upper ribs at an angle 45 degrees lower than what is natural, causing the illusion of an elongated neck. The vertebrae do not elongate, though the space between them may increase as the intervertebral discs absorb liquid.
The custom requires that the girls who wear the neck rings start before puberty, in order to get the body used to them. These heavy coils can weigh as much as .
Role of tourism.
Tourism is often considered to encourage the use of neck rings in Myanmar, as they are a popular attraction for tourists.
Kayan.
"Padaung" (Kayan Lahwi) women of the Kayan people begin to wear neck coils from as young as age two. The length of the coil is gradually increased to as much as twenty turns. The weight of the coils will eventually place sufficient pressure on the clavicles (collarbone) to cause them to deform and create an impression of a longer neck. This beauty ideal comes from Kayan legends where the elongated necks were meant to appear similar to the necks of a dragon or to help prevent fatal wounds from tiger attacks. Another story explains that this custom came to be so that the women would not be taken by neighboring tribes who may not like elongated necks.
Kayan girls usually begin to wear brass collars from the age of five to six years old, as it is more comfortable to deform the collarbone and upper ribs slowly. The alternative, an accelerated process at around the age of twelve, when girls first begin to compete for the attention of boys, is painful. Marco Polo first described the practice to Western culture in c. 1300. Refugee practitioners in Thailand were first accessible to tourists in 1984.
Ndebele.
The South Ndebele peoples of Africa also wear neck rings as part of their traditional dress and as a sign of wealth and status. Only married women are allowed to wear the rings, called "dzilla". Metal rings are also worn on different parts of the body, not just the neck. They can be worn around the arms and legs. Traditionally these rings are given to a wife by her husband, and not removed until the husband's death; however, these rings are individual and do not function as a body modification. The rings are usually made of copper or brass, usually stacked in multiples of three.

Paramount Theatre Building (Palm Beach, Florida)

The Paramount Theatre Building is a historic movie palace and theater and now church, located at 145 North County Road and Sunrise Avenue, Palm Beach, Florida.
History.
It was designed in the Moorish Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival styles by Joseph Urban in 1926. Urban also designed the nearby Mar-a-Lago and the Palm Beach Bath and Tennis Club.
By contrast to the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927), which Urban designed to bathe the audience in warmth and a general atmosphere of colorful gaiety, the Paramount Theatre employs simple lines and a cool, leisured palette of silver and green. "The theatre," Urban explained, "is not an escape from the life around, but a part of it, fitting into the rhythm of the community. The architecture of the Paramount Theatre … is accordingly simple, spacious, Southern."
On December 12, 1973, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
Church.
The Paramount Theatre Building now houses the Paramount Church, a non-denominational Christian church in Palm Beach. The Senior Pastor and Founder of Paramount Church is Rev. Dwight Stevens. The church sold the building in March 2021 to Woerners.

Anne Halkett

Anne Halkett (née Murray) (c. 1623 – 1699), also known as Lady Halkett, was an English religious writer and autobiographer.
Early life.
Halkett's father Thomas Murray was tutor to King James I's children. He later became Provost of Eton College. Her mother, Jane Drummond Murray, was governess to the king's children. When Thomas Murray died, Halkett was educated by her mother. She learned French, dancing, medicine, music, needlework, religion and surgery. Her religious education was extensive, and she read the Bible, said daily prayers and regularly attended church. In 1639 Dr Robert Johnstone, a friend of the jeweller George Heriot, bequeathed her a diamond ring.
Personal life.
Halkett's first romantic relationship was with Thomas Howard. Although Howard was from a distinguished family, he was not wealthy. This meant that marriage between them would be economically damaging to both families. Halkett's emotions were caught between the economic difficulties the marriage would result in, and the pain and loss of credibility that Howard would suffer if she did not marry him. To prevent Halkett from making an imprudent decision, her mother guarded her by having another person sleep in Halkett's room and forbidding her from seeing Howard again. Rather than disobey her mother, Halkett said goodbye to him while wearing a blindfold. Her relationship with Howard created a rift between her and her mother that lasted for fourteen months. Although Howard vowed never to marry another woman, he later broke this promise. Halkett reported in her writing that his marriage was known to be unhappy.
Halkett had a relationship with the Royalist Colonel Joseph Bampfield. She collaborated with him in several daring manoeuvres on behalf of the Royalist cause during the English Civil War. They rescued James, Duke of York, (who later became James II) from Parliamentary captivity. Halkett disguised him as a woman to effect his escape to continental Europe, commenting in her autobiography that he "was very pretty in it." She then gave him something to eat and sent him to safety on the continent with a special cake which she knew he liked. Halkett seems to have lived with Bampfield under the promise of marriage. However, Bampfield had been pretending to be a widower and Halkett later learned that his wife was alive.
Halkett came to Scotland and met King Charles at Dunfermline Palace. She practised medicine in Scotland, at Kinross and at Fyvie Castle where she stayed with Countess of Dunfermline. Bampfield came to see her at Fyvie.
In June 1652, she stayed a few days at Floors Castle with the Countess of Roxburghe. On her return to Edinburgh she stayed with the Sophia Lindsay, the pregnant wife of Sir Robert Moray in Lord Tweeddale's house in the Canongate. Sophia Lindsay died in childbirth a few days after Christmas. In February, Anne Murray moved to a lodging in Blackfriar's Wynd.
She later became a governess in the household of Sir James Halkett, a widower with two daughters. They were married in 1656 at Charlton House, the service was conducted in Henry Newton's closet by Mr Robert Gale, the chaplain of Christian Cavendish, Countess of Devonshire. 
Halkett was happily married to Sir James for 20 years. During her first pregnancy she wrote "The Mother's Will to her Unborn Child". When he died she was left with insufficient funds to support her family, and made her living by teaching children of nobility in her home. Her financial difficulties eased when James II provided her with a pension for her services to him during the English Civil War.
When she died, Halkett left behind 21 folio and quarto manuscript volumes that had been written between 1644 and the late 1690s. These manuscripts are now housed in the National Library of Scotland.
Written work.
Halkett's writings include an extensive autobiography (c. 1677), religious meditations, and "Instructions for Youth". For Halkett, writing about what she had read, her dreams, and her hopes for her children were a part of her daily domestic devotions as well as for pleasure. Her religious writings seem to have been composed over a fifty-five-year period (1644–99).
Halkett's autobiography (which can be titled as "Autobiography" or "Memoirs", depending on the editor) is a candid record of personal and political events during the English Civil War. It appears to have been written between 1677 and 1678. In it, Halkett gives a detailed account of her courtships and marriage. It is written with narrative suspense, and dialogue is used to capture both Halkett's own emotions and those of her lovers.

Lyric Theater (Miami)

The Lyric Theater is a historic theater in Miami, Florida at 819 Northwest Second Avenue. It served Miami's African American community. On January 4, 1989, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places after being proposed by Dorothy Jenkins Fields. 
Renamed the Black Archives Historic Lyric Theater Cultural Arts Complex (BAHLT), it is considered the oldest legitimate theater in Miami. Located west of Miami's downtown business district, it is a central focus for the Historic Overtown Folklife Village and a center of both black cultural pride and economic renewal.
History.
The 400-seat Lyric Theater was built, owned and operated by Geder Walker, a black businessman from Georgia. After opening in 1913 in Overtown, then a segregated area known as "Colored Town", the Lyric Theater provided a center for entertainment for blacks in Miami. In 1915, "The Miami News" described the Lyric as, "possibly the most beautiful and costly playhouse owned by Colored people in all the Southland." 
The theater was a key element in the community of "Little Broadway," an area whose hotels, restaurants and nightclubs attracted both black and white tourists and residents. The Lyric Theater operated as a movie and vaudeville theater for nearly fifty years. Representing black economic influence and freedom from discrimination, the Theater fueled a sense of pride and culture within Overtown. It helped the area to earn the nickname of "Harlem of the South". 
Following Geder Walker's death in 1919, ownership of the Lyric Theater passed to his wife Henrietta. The Lyric continued to operate as a theater and concert venue and as a community auditorium. Schools and civic groups performed there, and held special events such as commencement ceremonies. 
Overtown was a popular vacation destination for Black Americans, recommended by The Negro Motorist Green Book. Well-known speakers and performers appeared at the Lyric throughout the 1940s and ’50s, attracting a diverse audience that included Blacks, Latinos, and whites. Those who appeared at the Lyric Theater included W.E.B. DuBoise, Mary McLeod Bethune, Marian Anderson, Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, and the Fisk Jubilee Singers, among many others.
The Lyric operated as a movie theater until it was acquired by the General Assembly of the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith in 1959, and was put to use as a church. In the 1960s, the federal, state, and city governments used eminent domain to forcibly acquire buildings in the predominantly black community of Overtown, building a highway and other “urban renewal” projects. Most of the buildings in "Little Broadway" were destroyed. The Lyric Theater escaped destruction, but it remained closed for several decades. By 1974 it was owned by Bishop Walter McCollough and The United House of Prayer For All People"."
In 1988, the Lyric Theater was acquired by the Black Archives, History and Research Foundation of South Florida, Inc. In 1989, the Theater was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The building had suffered considerable damage over the years, including a hole in the roof and fire damage to the interior.
At least four periods of restoration have occurred since 1988. In 2000, following extensive renovation, the Lyric Theater was once again able to open to audiences. A second phase was completed in 2004, involving reconstruction of the lobby, box office, concessions and offices for the theater. Phase 3 involved renovations to the stage and administrative offices, with an official reopening in February 2014. Further renovations occurred in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when termites were detected and the stage was completely rebuilt. The Lyric Theater is once again a social center, reflective of both black economic influence and cultural pride.

Tuya Butte

Tuya Butte is a tuya in the Tuya Range of north-central British Columbia, Canada. It is a bit less isolated from other ranges than neighbouring Mount Josephine. Some of the other volcanoes in the area include South Tuya, Ash Mountain, and Mathews Tuya.
Tuya Butte was the first tuya analyzed in the geological literature, and its name has since become standard worldwide among volcanologists in referring to and writing about tuyas. The Tuya Mountains Provincial Park was recently established to protect this unusual landscape, which lies north of Tuya Lake and south of the Jennings River near the boundary with the Yukon Territory. Tuya Butte is regarded as among the best examples of this landform outside Iceland and Antarctica.
Tuya Butte was named by Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews in association with adjacent Tuya Lake and Butte Lake. The term "tuya" may be derived from a Tahltan word.
Geology.
Tuya Butte is part of the Tuya Volcanic Field, a volcanic field that includes tuyas, postglacial lapilli cones and lava flows and several small shield volcanoes formed during the Pleistocene and Holocene. This in turn is part of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province from Prince Rupert, into the Yukon and the Alaska border caused by rifting of the North American Plate as the Pacific Plate slides northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault.
Tuya Butte formed when magma intruded into and melted a vertical pipe in the overlying Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The partially molten mass cooled as a large block, forming the highly developed hyaloclastite and pillow lava with gravity flattening its upper surface. Horizontal columns occur at numerous locations along the periphery of the mass. The absence of glacial erosion of the tuya suggests that it erupted during the Pleistocene. The volcano has no summit crater or obvious vent, suggesting the volcano was fed by a fissure, although several indictions suggest a vent location near a large cirque on the north face. Other subglacial volcanoes can be found in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt.

Parkdale, Prince Edward Island

Parkdale is a neighbourhood of the city of Charlottetown in central Queens County, Prince Edward Island, Canada.
Parkdale's location immediately northeast of Charlottetown and southeast of Sherwood saw it grow from a rural farming community in the Queens Royalty to a village on November 6, 1958. It was incorporated as a town in 1973 and amalgamated into Charlottetown on April 1, 1995.
Presently a neighbourhood, Parkdale has a mix of housing, commercial and light industrial districts across an area of several dozen hectares, bounded by the former railway line (now the Confederation Trail) to the south and west, Belvedere Avenue/Falconwood Drive to the north, and the Hillsborough River to the east.
Parkdale had an active volunteer fire department, which was closed after municipal amalgamation. It is also the location of the Provincial Exhibition and Charlottetown Driving Park.

Chargeback insurance

Chargeback insurance is an insurance product that protects a merchant who accepts credit cards. The insurance protects the merchant against fraud in a transaction where the use of the credit card was unauthorized, and covers claims arising out of the merchant's liability to the service bank.
The phrase chargeback insurance is also sometimes used to describe the guarantee provided by online fraud prevention companies such as Vesta, ClearSale, Forter, Riskified and Signifyd. Unlike with card present transactions, where the merchant is not liable for the cost of fraudulent transactions (unless they do not meet technological security requirements such as EMV), merchants are liable for card not present transactions which turn out to be fraudulent. For this reason, online fraud prevention companies who offer decisions (meaning, they provide an approve or decline decision for orders) rather than scores (where the merchant must themselves decide whether to approve or decline) sometimes offer to cover the cost of the chargeback, since the chargeback would not have occurred had their decision not been incorrect. This form of chargeback insurance, more properly called a chargeback guarantee, will typically cover all losses of the relevant type, not only through one gateway or processor.
Coverage model.
Coverage can apply under a number of circumstances, including:
A merchant claiming under a chargeback insurance policy may be reimbursed for:
A typical chargeback insurance policy will only cover losses on credit card transactions purchased through its own specific payment processor or payment gateway.
While chargeback insurance can help cover losses, like any insurance there are pros and cons. While some fraud protection services charge a flat-rate fee per transaction (typically 0.5 to 15 cents per transaction), vendors who offer chargeback insurance usually charge a percentage-based fee of 0.5% to 1.5% which can be cost-prohibitive for higher-dollar transactions.

John Gary Evans

John Gary Evans (October 15, 1863June 26, 1942) was the 85th governor of South Carolina from 1894 to 1897.
Early life.
Evans was born in Cokesbury, South Carolina to an aristocratic and well-connected family. His father was Nathan George Evans, a Confederate general. After his father's death in 1868, Evans went to live in Edgefield with his uncle Martin Witherspoon Gary. After completing his secondary education in Cokesbury, he enrolled at Union College in Schenectady, New York. His uncle's death in 1881 forced him to withdraw from college due to financial constraints, but he would later graduate in 1883.
Political career.
Admitted to the bar in 1887, Evans began the practice of law in Aiken and became known for his representation of poor farmers. This representation led to the development of ties with John Lawrence Manning and Benjamin Tillman. Evans was elected in 1888 to the South Carolina House of Representatives at the age of 25. In 1892, he was elevated to the South Carolina Senate. A reform-minded politician, Evans identified himself with the progressive wing of South Carolina's Democratic Party.
His rapid political rise continued by being elected in 1894 as the 85th governor of South Carolina at the age of 31, the youngest ever South Carolina governor. During his time as governor, Evans continued the policies of Tillman, and presided over the constitution convention of 1895.
Pledging not to run for reelection as governor in 1896, Evans set his sights instead for the U.S. Senate race. He lost the election and his attempt for an open Senate seat in 1897 again proved equally unsuccessful. Frustrated, Evans volunteered as a major in the U.S. Army for the Spanish–American War in 1898 and helped create the civilian government of Havana. After the war, he resumed the practice of law in Spartanburg.
Later life and career.
Further attempts at an open Senate seat in 1902 and 1908 proved futile and henceforward he focused his energies on internal Democratic politics. Three times he served as a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1900, 1912 and 1916. In 1914, he became the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic State Executive Committee and from 1918 to 1928 was the National Democratic Committeeman from South Carolina. Evans won a term to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1922 from Spartanburg and served on the judiciary and rules committees.
On June 26, 1942, Evans died, and was buried at Willowbrook Cemetery in Edgefield. His Spartanburg home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer home video releases

DVDs of the television show "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" were produced by 20th Century Fox and released beginning in 2000. As well as containing the episodes, the DVD sets have extra features such as: audio commentaries by the show's producers, documentary features, blooper reels, and shooting scripts.
Differences between versions.
The "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" DVD sets were released in at least three encoding formats:
Aside from the region encoding (and the packaging), the Region 2 and Region 4 DVDs are identical. However, there are several content differences between the Region 1 DVDs and the Region 2 and 4 DVDs.
Scenes from previous episodes.
The Region 2 and 4 DVDs include the scenes from previous episodes ("Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") at the beginning of each episode (except season 2); the Region 1 DVDs do not.
This even applies to the final episode of season five, "The Gift", in which the "previously" scenes are a montage leading into the episode itself. This montage was deleted from "The Gift" on the Region 1 DVDs. This montage was later included as an easter egg on the Season 7 DVD set, even in Region 2 and 4.
Widescreen.
The series aired in a aspect ratio for all seven seasons in the United States, with the exception of "Once More, with Feeling" which was aired in widescreen. While the first three seasons were shot exclusively in 4:3, beginning with the fourth season the series was shot with a safe area, though according to Joss Whedon the series was intended to be shown in a 4:3 ratio, stating "Adding space to the sides simply for the sake of trying to look more cinematic would betray the very exact mise-en-scene I was trying to create. I am a purist, and this is the purest way to watch "Buffy". I have resisted the effort to letterbox "Buffy" from the start and always will, because that is not the show we shot." The extra material in the widescreen versions is never important for the plot, although it gives additional views of the sets and backgrounds.
Beginning in season four, the Region 2 and 4 DVDs include an open matte version of the television show. The Region 1 DVDs include the version.
The reason for this difference is that the Region 2 and 4 DVDs were released before the Region 1 DVDs, with less involvement from Mutant Enemy Productions. When the Region 1 DVDs were released, Joss Whedon decided that they should not have the widescreen version.
In 2011 Netflix began streaming seasons 4–7 in the 16:9 ratio, but would ultimately revert to the 4:3 ratio. In Nordic Region 2 countries Netflix streams those seasons in 4:3 ratio, despite the local DVDs being in widescreen.
As of August 4, 2016, Netflix began streaming all seven seasons in an updated HD version, replacing the original broadcast version. This version of the series is a remaster of the series in HD produced by the studio 20th Century Fox against the wishes of original production team. Many of the original production team, including Whedon himself, and fans have criticized the HD remaster for poor transferring of standard definition to high definition, the poor transition from 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9 aspect ratio, improper lighting, lack of lens filtering and poorly redone special effects that were either upscaled or redone in HD not true to the original. For season 1, each episode up to episode 8 had to be cropped, leaving everything in frame looking zoomed. Season 1, episode 7 has a few scenes fixed so they are using more of the frame. In other instances the 16:9 aspect ratio shows goofs in frame like crew members or filming equipment on screen. 20th Century Fox originally released the HD remaster as a syndicated broadcast on the network Pivot. Currently the HD remaster is not available for purchase on home media.
4% speed difference.
The Region 2 and 4 DVDs play the episodes at 4% faster than the Region 1 DVDs. This reduces the running time of each episode by about two minutes (not counting the "scenes from previous episodes"). It also causes the sound to be raised by two-thirds of a semitone. For example, a C note is raised to a note two-thirds of the way from C to C♯.
The speeds of the different region DVDs match the speeds used during the original television broadcasts in the respective countries. Thus the Region 1 DVD plays the video at the same speed as the American broadcasts (which is the speed at which the show was filmed), while the Region 2 and 4 DVDs plays the video at the slightly faster speed that was used during the original British broadcasts. This effect is not particular to the "Buffy" DVDs but affects all television shows, because film that uses 23.976 frames per second is sped up for PAL that uses 25 (in the 30fps NTSC standard it is subject to 3:2 pulldown and there is no speed variation). But since the signal from a DVD player is ultimately analog, the Region 2 and 4 DVDs will still play at the faster speed when played on an American television with a multi-region DVD.
In Brazil the standard color system is not PAL, but PAL-M which is also 24 frames per second. In addition to that, all DVD releases, despite being Region 4 are in NTSC, so the frame rate is also 24 frames per second.
Subtitles.
In the Region 2 and 4 releases, episodes with commentaries include two English subtitles: the show itself, and the commentary. The Region 1 releases do not offer subtitles for the commentaries.
The Region 1 DVDs also offer a smaller choice of non-English languages subtitles than the Region 2 and 4 DVDs.
Collections.
The Region 1 "Buffy" 40-disc boxed set includes a note from Joss Whedon as well as an extra disc (the 40th) with exclusive special features:
A repackaged 39-disc version was released on October 12, 2010, excluding the extra disc of bonus features.
Slimmer versions.
The entire series was re-released on DVD in 2006, in a "slimmer" package with the same bonus materials that were featured in the original fold out versions. Even "slimmer" versions were issued in 2008.
Thematic releases.
Two special Region 1 DVD releases contain assorted episodes from various seasons:
In Region 2, there have been several single-disc releases named after individual characters from the show, under the overarching title of "The Slayer Collection". Each contains four episodes and a character profile. The Spike-centric DVD contains the same episodes as the Region 1 "Love is Hell" collection. Other discs focus on Willow, Xander, Giles, Cordelia, Dawn, Angel, and Faith.
Two other single-disc Region 2 DVDs have been released. The first is titled "The Very Best of...". It contains these four episodes: "Becoming, Part One", "Graduation Day, Part Two", "Hush", and "The Gift". The second contains the episode "Once More, with Feeling" and a number of special features including a featurette on season 1 of "Angel" and a featurette titled ""Buffy", Inside the Music".
In October 2008, a limited edition bonus DVD was made available exclusively to the retail chain Best Buy. The Region 1 85-minute DVD documents the 2008 "Buffy" Reunion at the Paley Festival, filmed on March 20, 2008. The DVD features interviews with Amber Benson, Nicholas Brendon, Charisma Carpenter, Emma Caulfield, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Seth Green, David Greenwalt, James Marsters, Michelle Trachtenberg &amp; Joss Whedon. The DVD is available on Amazon and manufactured on-demand using DVD-R media.

Hamid Idris Awate

Hamid Idris Awate (; 10 April 1910 – 28 May 1962) was an Eritrean revolutionary and prominent guerrilla commander, and a symbol of the Eritrean War of Independence and independence struggle.
Early life in Italian Eritrea.
Awate was born in 1910 in Gerset, located between Tessenei and Golluj in southwestern Italian Eritrea. His father, a peasant, trained him as early as childhood in the use of guns. Hamid was of Beni-Amer descent.
In 1935, Hamid was conscripted by the Italians to serve in the colonial army of the Eritrean Ascari. Beside his fluency in Arabic, Tigre, Tigrinya, Nara, Hedareb, and Kunama, Hamid learned the Italian language very well within a short period of time and was sent to Rome for a course in military intelligence.
After returning from Italy, he was appointed as a security officer in western Eritrea. Shortly after, he served as deputy chief (Mayor) of the city of Kassala (Sudan) and its surroundings during the brief Italian occupation of that city in 1940/1941 at the beginning of World War II. As Mayor of Kassala he promoted the political union of that city to his country, Eritrea, but Allied offensives at the end of January 1941 forced him to renounce to it.
He fought as an Eritrean ascari in the Battle of Keren during World War II and participated in the Italian guerrilla campaign in Eritrea against Allied forces with the cavalrymen of Ali Gabre.
After the Italians were completely pushed out of Eritrea, Hamid settled in western Eritrea but eventually recruited an army of 50 people and began to raid the Kunama and Nara tribes from 1942 to 1948. His actions eventually attracted the attention of the British authorities, who offered a considerable award for his capture, dead or alive. Afterwards, Hamid and his armed faction surrendered to British in 1951 after they agreed not to prosecute him for his crimes.
Resistance against Ethiopia.
In 1958 a group of Eritrean exiles in Cairo founded the Eritrean Liberation Movement under Hamid's leadership.
In July 1960, in the city of Cairo, a group of young Eritrean students and intellectuals held a meeting and formed the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). The group consisted of the following men: Idris Mohammed Adem (the president of the National Assembly of Eritrea); Idris Osman Galaydos (a graduate of law school of Cairo University); Mohammed Saleh Hummed (a graduate of law school of Cairo University); Said Hussian (a student of Al-Az'har University in Cairo); Adem Mohammed Akte (a graduate from University of Cairo) and Taha Mohammed Noor (a graduate from Italy)
Back home, the Eritrean authorities were suspicious of Hamid's movements and activities and were watching him closely. Eritrean police forces planned to arrest Hamid in his village in August 1961. Turki explains that the Ethiopians deployed a large amount of police forces but their plans were foiled by an Eritrean Muslim within the Eritrean police who informed Hamid earlier of that plan. Hamid then fled to Mount Adal located to the west of Agordat.
Hamid's decision to begin armed resistance was reached after a period of long deliberations with other Muslims. In an interview with "Eritrea Al-haditha", issue #75, second year, pioneer Mohammed Al-Hassan Dohen, a long time friend of Hamid and Hamid's assistant when he was district chief, says: "In the year 1960, Idris Mohammed Adem sent a message to Hamid. Hamid Awate told me that Idris Mohammed Adem was asking him to declare the armed struggle; but he was not ready for it at that time. After four months, Mohammed Al-Shiekh Daood came and asked Hamid to declare the revolution. Hamid agreed to lead the armed struggle and declare the revolution but asked for money and weapons as long as he was notorious Outlaw. Mohammed Al-Shiekh Daood braved Hamid with old arms, three five bullet rifles "abu khamsa" and gave him 3 Birr with sugar and tea all was provided throw Egyptian Muslims. In addition, Ibrahim Mohammed Ali brought two rifles.
On 1 September 1961, eleven freedom fighters led by Hamid attacked police posts in the west of Eritrea include one on Mount Adal. A fierce battle ensued between Hamid's and Eritrean police forces, lasting 30 minutes ending in a stalemate.
Death.
On May 27 1962, Awate told his unit that he was not feeling well. His condition began to deteriorate quickly. It is said that Awate called pioneer Kiboob Hajaj and gave him his beloved gun emphasizing on the continuation of the revolution. On the morning of next day, Awate died; his companions buried him secretly and did not reveal his death until four years later.
A statue was erected by the Government of Eritrea on 1 September 1994 at his grave site.
Even in Italy Hamid is celebrated by the Italo-Eritrean associations.

<doc id="7006886" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7006886" title="Semovente da 90/53">
Semovente da 90/53

The Semovente da 90/53 was an Italian self-propelled gun and tank destroyer, used by the Italian and German Armies during World War II.
Development.
The Semovente da 90/53 was created by mounting a 90 mm Cannone da 90/53 anti-aircraft gun on top of an enlarged chassis of a M14/41 tank. Only 30 of these vehicles were produced, all in 1942.
The Semovente da 90/53 was primarily developed in response to demands by Italian forces on the Eastern Front for a vehicle-mounted anti-tank weapon that could take on Soviet T-34 and KV tanks. Italian armoured forces on the Eastern Front were equipped only with the L6/40 tank and Semovente 47/32 self-propelled gun; neither of these had the firepower to cope with the Soviet medium and heavy tanks. However, no Semovente da 90/53 were ever sent to the Eastern Front.
The major drawback of the Semovente da 90/53, as with many self-propelled gun types of World War II, was the open top and rear of the gun compartment, which left the gun crew exposed to shrapnel. The small ammunition capacity of the vehicle—eight rounds—was also a problem, necessitating the creation of special ammunition carriers out of Fiat L6/40 tanks, one accompanying each Semovente da 90/53 in the field. The L6 ammunition carrier carried 26 rounds, plus an additional 40 rounds in a towed trailer. Beside the standard Armour Penetrating rounds, it could fire "Effetto Pronto", or HEAT rounds, which shaped charge could pierce 200mm armour plating at any range.
Combat use.
None were ever sent to the Eastern Front. In the North African Campaign, the Semovente da 90/53 proved to be an effective weapon and its long range was well suited to the flat and open desert terrain. 24 Semovente 90/53s saw service with the 10th Self-propelled Anti-tank Grouping against the Allies in Sicily during the Allied invasion in 1943.
Surviving vehicle.
Only one Semovente da 90/53 survived the war. Originally displayed at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), as shown in the sidebar photo above, it was transferred the Fort Sill Field Artillery Museum in Fort Sill, Oklahoma in 2012. It has since been restored by the Fort Sill Directorate of Logistics (DoL) paint shop and is awaiting display. This surviving example has, "A fairly good history. It was assigned to the 163rd Support Artillery Group, was captured in Sicily in 1943 and shipped back to Aberdeen for evaluation."

<doc id="7006892" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7006892" title="Battle of Ballantyne Pier">
Battle of Ballantyne Pier

The Battle of Ballantyne Pier occurred in Ballantyne Pier during a docker's strike in Vancouver, British Columbia, in June 1935.
The strike can be traced back to 1912 when the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), began organizing the waterfront workers in Canada, alongside the Lumber Handlers' Union in Vancouver. Going head to head with the employers association, the Shipping Federation, several strikes resulting in wage increases were won by workers in the coming years. Victories on the waterfront increased over the next decade, and by 1923, the Shipping Federation became determined to break the power of the ILA.
A strike broke out in October 1923 which saw 1400 men joining picket lines at the Vancouver waterfront. However, provisions had been made by the Shipping Federation. The dockers were immediately met by 350 men armed with shotguns who had been housed on a nearby ship. This intimidation of the strikers, coupled with the fact that ships were still being loaded and unloaded by numerous non-union workers, forced the strike to collapse two months later.
The 1923 strike destroyed the ILA, and it was soon replaced by a new organization, the Vancouver and District Waterfront Workers' Association (VDWWA). Set up originally by the bosses as a company union, the VDWWA soon began to take a confrontational stance towards the Shipping Federation. By 1935, nearly every port in British Columbia had been organised by the VDWWA. Following the pretext to the destruction of the ILA, the Shipping Federation provoked another major strike in the spring of 1935, locking out 50 dockers at the port at Powell River.
The strike soon snowballed to bring other dockers across the region into the fold. Following a refusal to unload ships coming from Powell River, 900 workers were met with a lockout in Vancouver. Dockers across the border in Seattle also refused to unload ships coming from Vancouver and Powell River that were manned by non-union workers.
On June 18, several weeks after the original lockout, between 900-1100 dockers and their supporters marched through Vancouver towards Ballantyne Pier where non-union workers were unloading ships. The strikers were met at the pier by several hundred armed policemen. Attempting to force their way through, the dockers soon found themselves under attack from the police lines. Many marchers were clubbed as they tried to run to safety, while many others tried hopelessly to fight back, using whatever weapons they could find.
Aided by Mounties who had been posted nearby, the police continued to attack the strikers. The VDWWA union hall was attacked, with tear gas being used against members of the women's auxiliary who had set up a first aid station inside. The battle continued for three hours, and included police actually firing their guns at the strikers. the battle produced several hospitalizations, including that of a fleeing striker who had been shot in the back of his legs.
Despite the violence of June 18, the strike dragged on into December, but the strike lost much of its militant character after the fighting at Ballantyne Pier. The struggle to form a union completely independent of the Shipping Federation continued for another two years, when, in 1937, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) was born.
The strike of 1935 failed. It, however, helped the future founding of a union for the dockers of British Columbia that was completely independent of the employers' association. The ILWU participated in numerous disputes in the following years, and in the 1940s, it was integral in winning many strikes that lead to better pay and conditions for waterfront workers.
Background.
The Vancouver and District Waterfront Workers' Association (VDWWA) was established as a company union following a defeated longshoremen's strike in 1923, replacing the International Longshoremen's Association. Communist organizers with the Workers' Unity League (WUL) managed to seize control of the VDWWA's executive a decade later and transformed it into a militant union, which then began working towards strike action. A strike, more accurately a lock-out, finally commenced on 27 May 1935. That was several months after an agreement had been reached between the union and the Shipping Federation of British Columbia, but the terms were unfavourable to the longshoremen.
In late May, union membership voted to take over the despatching of work gangs on the harbour to load and unload ships as required. Despatching was a key issue for longshoremen, and prior to the 1923 strike had been carried out by the union. Longshoremen claimed that the Shipping Federation of British Columbia, an employers' association of waterfront-based companies and the main employer on the docks, unfairly discriminated against workers. Especially targeted were those considered sympathetic to an independent union or simply disliked by the despatcher, making the allocation of work a punitive mechanism and the job itself insecure. When the union unilaterally took over despatching, the Federation claimed that it was a violation of their agreement and locked out the longshoremen. Replacement workers, known pejoratively as "scabs" by strikers, were mobilized along with hundreds of police specials, who were recruited to break the strike.
Anticommunist context.
Meanwhile, nearly 2000 relief camp workers flooded into Vancouver on 4 April 1935. These were unemployed men protesting the conditions of the federal relief camps that were set up as a stop-gap solution to the unemployment crisis by the Department of Defence. Camp inmates were also organized under the Workers' Unity League into the Relief Camp Workers' Union. Communist leaders were attempting to merge the two strikes and spark a general strike. The Shipping Federation and the police were aware of the plan and claimed it was an attempt to start a Bolshevik revolution on the Pacific Coast. Thus, when the waterfront strike finally began, tensions were already high between anticommunists and strikers.
Historians agree that both strikes were driven by legitimate grievances: abysmal conditions in the relief camps and despatching and other workplace issues on the waterfront. Nevertheless, a massive mobilization that included all three levels of police, with specials attached to each police force, took place in anticipation of an attempted revolution. Specials trained at the Beatty Street Drill Hall under Brigadier-General Victor Odlum and Colonel C.E. Edgett and were co-ordinated by a group called the Citizens' League of British Columbia, a vigilante organization funded by the Shipping Federation. Militia units based in the Point Grey neighbourhood of Vancouver and in Victoria, British Columbia were also ready to be called to action on short notice. The Point Grey militia, however, consisted of inmates of a specially designated relief camp, and many of them eventually joined the relief camp strikers.
The communist plan to merge the strikes and spark a general strike failed except for a one-day demonstration commemorating May Day. On 3 June 1935, shortly after the waterfront strike began, the relief camp strikers left the city to begin the On-to-Ottawa Trek in an effort to take their grievance to the nation's capital. Nevertheless, the authorities persisted in conflating the waterfront strike with revolution, perhaps because they were alarmed by the waterfront strike in the United States the previous year that had shut down most shipping operations along the American coast and culminated in a bloody general strike in San Francisco.
The battle.
On 18 June 1935, about 1000 protesters, consisting of striking longshoremen and their supporters, marched towards the Heatley Street entrance to Ballantyne Pier, where strikebreakers were unloading ships in the harbour.
Unlike earlier waterfront strikes, longshoremen were prevented from picketing the docks to discourage strikebreaking and claimed that they were going to go "en masse" to talk to the non-union workers. They were led by Victoria Cross recipient Mickey O'Rourke and a contingent of World War I veterans and marched behind a Union Jack flag, to great symbolic effect. At the entrance to the pier, they were met by Chief Constable Colonel W. W. Foster, who warned the demonstrators that they would not be permitted to proceed. When they refused to turn back, protesters were attacked with clubs by the police guarding the pier.
Within minutes, more police joined in the fight. In addition to the Vancouver police, contingents from the British Columbia Provincial Police, who had been hiding behind boxcars, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police engaged with demonstrators. The police chased the dispersing crowd, continuing to club people even as they fled and fired tear gas. Many protesters fought back, throwing rocks and other projectiles at the police, and others who were attacked were simply trying to flee the scene.
That continued for three hours and spread throughout the nearby residential district. Several people, both police and protesters, were hospitalized as a result of the riot, and one bystander was shot in the back of his legs by a police shotgun. Offices of communist organizers and the longshoremen's union were also raided, with tear gas shot through the windows to drive out any occupants before the police entered. Strike supporters set up a makeshift hospital at the Ukrainian Hall, and the police did the same for their wounded at the Coroner's Court on Cordova Street. In total, 28 out of the 60 injured were hospitalized and 24 men were arrested. Mayor Gerry McGeer declared that striking longshoremen would no longer be eligible for relief payments for themselves or their families.
Outcome.
The Battle of Ballantyne was the bloody climax of a very volatile year in Vancouver, but fell far short of the insurrection anticipated by the police and anticommunists. It was also a turning point in the waterfront strike, which, although it dragged on until December, lost its optimistic and militant character after the battle. Longshoremen, however, would continue to fight for the right to organize an independent union and to control dispatching, and finally succeeded a decade later when they formed the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), Local 500.
It was also the last of WUL militancy that Vancouver would witness. That same year, the Comintern in Moscow abandoned its Third Period strategy, which entailed the creation of the Workers' Unity League and similar militant trade union organizations in other countries with the goal of building a radical labour movement separate from mainstream labour organizations. Under the new Popular Front strategy, Communists joined established unions and helped to build the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Moreover, Communist priorities shifted from the industrial to the political arena, where they fielded candidates and supported Cooperative Commonwealth Federation candidates, while others joined the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion to fight Franco's fascists in the Spanish Civil War.
While far more localized than the On-to-Ottawa Trek, the Battle of Ballantyne Pier was part of the fierce, and perhaps paranoid, anticommunist reaction provoked by the Communists and the militant workers' movement they led. Public attitudes shifted away from the Conservative government of R.B. Bennett because of its mishandling of depression-era unrest in such events, which paved the way for Bennett's defeat in the federal election that same year. Although machine guns were not used in the riot, another First World War technology was introduced in Vancouver policing that day: tear gas. Another major clash between the unemployed and the police took place in 1938. Relief camp workers returned to the city and were violently evicted from Post Office by means of tear gas bombs and police clubs (primarily the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in that instance).

Love Affair (1994 film)

Love Affair is a 1994 American romantic drama film and a remake of the 1939 film of the same name. It was directed by Glenn Gordon Caron and produced by Warren Beatty from a screenplay by Robert Towne and Beatty, based on the 1939 screenplay by Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart, based on the story by Mildred Cram and Leo McCarey. The music score was by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography by Conrad L. Hall.
The film stars Beatty, Annette Bening and Katharine Hepburn in her final film role, with Garry Shandling, Chloe Webb, Pierce Brosnan, Kate Capshaw, Paul Mazursky and Brenda Vaccaro.
Plot.
On a flight to Sydney, sports announcer and former football star Mike Gambril meets singer Terry McKay, each of them engaged. Their plane malfunctions and is forced to make an emergency descent, during which Mike and Terry comfort each other. The plane manages an emergency landing on a remote atoll, and the passengers wait to be rescued by nearby ships.
As Mike gets himself accustomed to the boat he selected, a Russian cruise boat, Terry arrives aboard as well as her ship was being redirected elsewhere. As the passengers get more and more drunk with the Russian crew, Mike and Terry almost have an encounter but it is curtailed by party revelers. She reconsiders and runs to her room.
The next day, with a hangover, Terry says she doesn't want to make a "mess" of her life with an affair and tries to push Mike off the topic. Instead, Mike invites Terry to visit his elderly aunt, Ginny on the isle of Moorea during a routine stopover. During the visit, Terry sees a different side of Mike as they have lunch with his aunt and play music together. The romantic setting kindles their romance and, instead of taking a more convenient jet back to their respective destinations, they continue their romance on the boat for a few more days.
Finally, on the way home on the return flight to New York, they agree to reunite at the top of the Empire State Building in three months' time to test their convictions and current relationships. Terry breaks up with her fiancé Ken Allen, as does Mike with his fiancée, Lynn Weaver.
Terry finds work as a singer, mostly in advertisements. Mike, to the chagrin of his agent, is having an existential crisis about his TV career and ruminates about returning to his hobby painting. He quits his job in TV and works as the head coach at a small college. One of his primary pieces is a portrait of Terry in prayer from their idyllic day on the island, wearing his aunt's hand-made shawl.
Months later, on the way to the rendezvous, Terry is struck down by a car while crossing a street jaywalking. Gravely injured, she is rushed to the hospital. Mike, waiting for her at the observation deck at the top of the building, is unaware of the accident. After many hours, in the rain, he finally concedes at midnight that she has rejected him.
Now unable to walk as a paraplegic, Terry refuses to contact Mike and let him see her in her paralyzed condition. Instead, she finds a job as a music teacher in a small elementary school. Six months after the accident, she sees Mike with his former fiancée at a holiday concert featuring Ray Charles, which Terry is attending with her former boyfriend, Ken. Mike does not notice her condition because she is seated. Each can only manage a terse hello, with Mike looking irritated.
Christmas Eve arrives and Mike makes a surprise visit, claiming to have come across her address while looking up another name in a telephone directory. Although he steers the conversation to make her explain her actions, Terry merely dodges the subject, never leaving the couch on which she rests. Mike mentions his aunt, now deceased, had left the shawl for her in her will. His aunt had taken a liking to Terry and secretly hoped the two would marry and straighten out Mike's life. Mike mentions, that he "made a painting of you with that shawl." Mike had left it in disgust at the hotel previously and the hotel manager had the restaurant display it.
About to leave her life for good, Mike remarks that the painting was given to a woman recently who very much admired it. He is about to point out that the woman was in a wheelchair when he suddenly pauses, realizing that Terry isn't moving in her couch and making no effort to get up to say goodbye. Mike walks into Terry's bedroom, opens the door and sees his painting hanging on the wall. He now knows why she did not keep their appointment.
Background and production.
In August 1993, it was reported that Warren Beatty would produce and star alongside his wife Annette Bening in "Love Affair", a remake of the 1939 film "Love Affair" with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne and of the 1957 film "An Affair to Remember" with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, both directed by Leo McCarey. When questioned why he chose to remake "Love Affair", Beatty stated:
There are certain stories that have a universal theme and you can do it again. My theory is to be very respectful of the material. It’s the basic yarn that holds up.
The name of Terry McKay's character remained the same in all three films, while a different one was chosen for each of the three leading men.
"Love Affair" was Hepburn's first big-screen appearance in nearly 10 years (although she had made several TV movies in this time) and marked her last appearance in cinema. It includes the only time that she ever said the word "fuck" on-screen. Beatty personally lobbied 86-year-old Hepburn to appear in the film. He rented a house for her in Los Angeles and had her referred to a special dermatologist, but she did not give a definitive answer until the day of filming. Luise Rainer was also considered for the role.
Filming took place in New York City, Los Angeles and on the islands of Tahiti and Moorea in French Polynesia.
Reception.
The remake was neither a critical nor a commercial success at the box office. It grossed $18 million domestically over a budget of $60 million and holds a 28% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 29 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade "B+" on scale of A to F. The film was nominated for one Razzie Award, Worst Remake or Sequel.

Prefix order

In mathematics, especially order theory, a prefix ordered set generalizes the intuitive concept of a tree by introducing the possibility of continuous progress and continuous branching. Natural prefix orders often occur when considering dynamical systems as a set of functions from "time" (a totally-ordered set) to some phase space. In this case, the elements of the set are usually referred to as "executions" of the system.
The name "prefix order" stems from the prefix order on words, which is a special kind of substring relation and, because of its discrete character, a tree.
Formal definition.
A prefix order is a binary relation "≤" over a set "P" which is antisymmetric, transitive, reflexive, and downward total, i.e., for all "a", "b", and "c" in "P", we have that:
Functions between prefix orders.
While between partial orders it is usual to consider order-preserving functions, the most important type of functions between prefix orders are so-called history preserving functions. Given a prefix ordered set "P", a history of a point "p"∈"P" is the (by definition totally ordered) set "p"− = {"q" | "q" ≤ "p"}. A function "f": "P" → "Q" between prefix orders "P" and "Q" is then history preserving if and only if for every "p"∈"P" we find "f"("p"−) = "f"("p")−. Similarly, a future of a point "p"∈"P" is the (prefix ordered) set "p"+ = {"q" | "p" ≤ "q"} and "f" is future preserving if for all "p"∈"P" we find "f"("p"+) = "f"("p")+.
Every history preserving function and every future preserving function is also order preserving, but not vice versa.
In the theory of dynamical systems, history preserving maps capture the intuition that the behavior in one system is a "refinement" of the behavior in another. Furthermore, functions that are history and future preserving surjections capture the notion of bisimulation between systems, and thus the intuition that a given refinement is "correct" with respect to a specification.
The range of a history preserving function is always a prefix closed subset, where a subset "S ⊆ P" is prefix closed if for all "s,t ∈ P" with "t∈S" and "s≤t" we find "s∈S".
Product and union.
Taking history preserving maps as "morphisms" in the category of prefix orders leads to a notion of product that is "not" the Cartesian product of the two orders since the Cartesian product is not always a prefix order. Instead, it leads to an "arbitrary interleaving" of the original prefix orders. The union of two prefix orders is the disjoint union, as it is with partial orders.
Isomorphism.
Any bijective history preserving function is an order isomorphism. Furthermore, if for a given prefix ordered set "P" we construct the set "P- ≜ { p- | p∈ P}" we find that this set is prefix ordered by the subset relation ⊆, and furthermore, that the function "max: P- → P" is an isomorphism, where "max(S)" returns for each set "S∈P-" the maximum element in terms of the order on P (i.e. "max(p-) ≜ p").

HMS Anson (1781)

HMS "Anson" was a ship of the Royal Navy, launched at Plymouth on 4 September 1781. Originally a 64-gun third rate ship of the line, she fought at the Battle of the Saintes.
In 1794 she was razeed to produce a frigate of 44 guns (fifth rate). Stronger than the average frigate of the time, the razee frigate "Anson" subsequently had a successful career during the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, mostly operating against privateers, but also in small actions against enemy frigates.
"Anson" was wrecked on 29 December 1807. Trapped by a lee shore off Loe Bar, Cornwall, England, she hit the rocks and between 60 and 190 men were killed. The subsequent treatment of the recovered bodies of drowned seamen caused controversy, and led to the Burial of Drowned Persons Act 1808.
Design and construction.
The ship was ordered on 24 April 1773 as an "Intrepid"-class ship of the line of 64 guns. The lead ship of the class, , had entered service in 1771 and proved satisfactory in sea trials, so the Royal Navy increased their order from four to fifteen ships. "Anson" was part of the expanded order, named after George Anson, 1st Baron Anson, the victorious admiral of the First Battle of Cape Finisterre (1747).
"Anson" was launched on 4 September 1781 by Georgina, Duchess of Devonshire. She was completed and entered service on 15 October 1781.
The "Intrepid"-class design had been originally approved in 1765, so by the time "Anson" was launched it was over 15 years old. During that period, the design of ships-of-the-line had evolved, with the standard size and layout now being the seventy-four. "Anson" was therefore rather small and less solidly built than most of her contemporaries.
Battle of the Saintes.
"Anson" fought at the battle of Les Saintes on 12 April 1782 under the flag of Admiral Sir George Rodney against Admiral de Grasse. She was in the rear division, which was under the command of Rear-Admiral Francis Samuel Drake. In this engagement, Captain William Blair was one of the two Royal Navy post captains killed. Captain Blair was struck at waist level by a French cannonball and horrifically sliced in two.
In all "Anson" lost three men killed (including Blair), and 13 men wounded.
Conversion to a frigate.
At the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, 64-gun ships of the line were no longer being built and were considered obsolete. They were outclassed by the standard 74-gun ships of the line which would come to dominate the major fleet actions of the age. In early 1794 the Royal Navy decided to razee four 64 gun ships to 44 gun heavy frigates in order to counter a small number of large 24 pounder frigates rumored to be building in France. Only three 64’s were selected for conversion, of which Anson was one. A razee is the cutting down of a larger ship of the line by removing the uppermost deck (and its armament) to produce a large frigate. The subsequent razee frigate was more heavily armed and had much thicker planking than a typical purpose-built frigate. They also tended to be slower.
"Anson" was chosen for this process and in 1794 the ship was razeed. The original forecastle and quarterdeck were removed, and the former upper deck (now weather or spar-deck) was partially removed and restructured to provide a new forecastle and quarterdeck. The result was a frigate of 44 guns, with a primary gun deck armament of twenty-six 24-pounder cannon (most frigates of the time were too lightly built to handle such heavy guns, so were armed with 18-pounders). The new quarterdeck and forecastle also allowed the armaments stationed there to be substantially strengthened from the original design, including adding carronades. "Anson" was thus heavily armed for a frigate, and retained the stronger construction (and ability to absorb damage) of a ship-of-the-line.
French Revolutionary Wars.
At the action of 16 July 1797, "Anson" and drove the French corvette "Calliope" on shore, where "Sylph" proceeded to fire on her. When checked a week later, "Calliope" was wrecked; her crew were camped on shore trying to salvage what stores they could. "Pomone" confirmed that the flute "Freedom" and a brig that had also been driven ashore too were wrecked.
, "Anson", , , and shared in the proceeds of the capture on 10 September 1797 of "Tordenskiold".
On 29 December 1797 "Anson" recaptured , which the French had captured three years earlier in December 1794 and taken into service under her existing name. "Daphné" was under the command of "lieutenant de vaisseau" Latreyte and transiting between Lorient and Bordeaux on her way to Guadeloupe when "Anson" captured her at the mouth of the Gironde. "Anson" fired several shots before "Daphne" struck. She was armed with 30 guns and had 276 men aboard, including 30 passengers. Two of the passengers were Civil Commissioners Jaiquelin and La Carze, who succeeded in throwing their dispatches for Guadeloupe overboard. "Daphne" had five men killed and several wounded.
On 7 September 1798, after a 24-hour long chase, "Anson" and captured "Flore". Captain Stopford, of "Phaeton", in his letter described "Flore" as a frigate of 36 guns and 255 men. She was eight days out of Boulogne on a cruise. She had also served the Royal Navy in the American Revolutionary War.
"Anson" was unable to take part in the Battle of Tory Island on 12 October 1798, because she had sustained damage during poor weather and was unable to keep up with the rest of the British squadron. In the aftermath of the original engagement, on 18 October she joined the brig HMS "Kangaroo" and fought a separate action, capturing the damaged French frigate "Loire". "Anson" was then under the command of Captain Philip Charles Durham, who struggled to manoeuvre his ship after having lost her mizzen mast, main lower and topsail yards during the earlier pursuit.
"Anson" sailed from Plymouth on 26 January 1799, and on 2 February, in company with "Ethalion", captured the French privateer cutter "Boulonaise". "Boulonaise", of Dunkirk, was armed with 14 guns and had been preying on shipping in the North Sea.
On 9 September 1799 Captain Durham hosted a fête for King George III. During the course of the evening, the king was found on the lower deck surrounded by the ship's company and talking to an old sailor.
On 10 April 1800, when north-west of the Canary Islands, "Anson" detained "Catherine &amp; Anna" bound for Hamburg, Holy Roman Empire, from Batavia with a cargo of coffee.
On 27 April "Anson" captured the letter of marque brig "Vainquer". "Vainquer" was pierced for 16 guns but only mounted four. When captured she had been on her way from Bordeaux to San Domingo with a cargo of merchandise.
Two days later, at daybreak, "Anson" encountered four French privateers: "Brave" (36 guns), "Guepe" (18), "Hardi" (18), and "Duide" (16). As soon as the French vessels realized that "Anson" was a British frigate they scattered. As "Anson" passed "Brave" going in the opposite direction "Anson" fired a broadside into her; Durham believed that the broadside did considerable damage, but he was unable to follow up as "Brave" had the wind in her favour and so outsailed "Anson". Durham then set off after one of the other French vessels, which he was able to capture. She was "Hardi", of 18 guns and 194 men. Durham described her as "a very fine new Ship just of the Stocks." The Royal Navy took "Hardi" into service, first as HMS "Hardi", before shortly thereafter renaming her . Lastly, Durham reported sending into port for adjudication a very valuable ship that had been sailing from Batavia to Hamburg with the Governor of Batavia as passenger. (This may have been "Catherine &amp; Anna".)
On 27 June "Anson" and came across some 40 or 50 Spanish merchant vessels on the Straits of Gibraltar. They were protected by some 25 gunboats. Two row boats came out from Gibraltar to assist "Anson" and the British were able to capture eight Spanish merchantmen, though the Spanish recaptured one.
These included:
On 29 June "Anson" and "Constance" captured two privateer misticos: "Gibraltar" and "Severo" (or "Severino"). "Gibraltar" was armed with four guns and had a crew of 50 men. "Severo" was armed with two guns and ten swivel guns, and had a crew of 26 men.
On 30 June "Anson" cut off two Spanish gun boats that had been annoying the convoy she was escorting. The two proved to be "Gibraltar" and "Salvador". They each mounted two 18–pounder guns in their bow, and each had eight guns of different dimensions on their sides. They were each manned by 60 men and probably sustained heavy casualties in resisting "Anson".
In 1801 Captain W. E. Cacraft assumed command and "Anson" joined the Channel station, cruising from Portsmouth. In 1802 she was in the Mediterranean, and in November she sailed from Malta for Egypt. She was at Syracuse 20 February 1804. Arrived at Malta on 21 October, 1804. She went in for repairs in 1805 at Portsmouth.
Napoleonic Wars.
In December 1805 Captain Charles Lydiard was appointed to command "Anson". She was driven ashore in a gale at Portsmouth on 16 January 1806, but was refloated later the same day, undamaged. Under Lydiard's command, "Anson" sailed to the West Indies in early 1806.
Action of 23 August 1806.
On 23 August while sailing in company with Captain Charles Brisbane's when they came across the 38-gun Spanish frigate "Pomona" off Havana, guarded by a shore battery and twelve gunboats. "Pomona" was trying to enter the harbour, whereupon Lydiard and Brisbane bore up and engaged her. The gunboats came out to defend her, whereupon the two British frigates anchored between the shore battery and gunboats on one side, and "Pomona" on the other. A hard-fought action began, which lasted for 35 minutes until "Pomona" struck her colours. Three of the gunboats were blown up, six were sunk, and the remaining three were badly damaged. The shore battery was obliged to stop firing after an explosion in one part of it. There were no casualties aboard "Anson", but "Arethusa" lost two killed and 32 wounded, with Brisbane among the latter. The captured "Pomona" was subsequently taken into the Navy as .
"Anson" and "Foudroyant".
"Anson" remained cruising off Havana, and on 15 September sighted the French 84-gun "Foudroyant". "Foudroyant", carrying the flag of Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, had been dismasted in a storm and was carrying a jury-rig. Despite the superiority of his opponent and the nearness of the shore Lydiard attempted to close on the French vessel and opened fire. "Anson" came under fire from the fortifications at Morro Castle, while several Spanish ships, including the 74-gun "San Lorenzo", came out of Havana to assist the French. After being unable to manoeuvre into a favourable position and coming under heavy fire, Lydiard hauled away and made his escape. "Anson" had two killed and 13 wounded during the engagement, while its sails and rigging had been badly damaged. "Foudroyant" meanwhile had 27 killed or wounded.
Capture of Curaçao.
"Anson" was then assigned to Charles Brisbane's squadron and joined Brisbane's and James Athol Wood's .
The ships were despatched in November 1806 by Vice-Admiral James Richard Dacres to reconnoitre Curaçao. They were joined in December by and Brisbane decided to launch an attack. The British ships approached early in the morning of 1 January 1807 and anchored in the harbour. They were attacked by the Dutch, at which Brisbane boarded and captured the 36-gun frigate "Halstaar", while Lydiard attacked and secured the 20-gun corvette "Suriname". Both Lydiard and Brisbane then led their forces on shore, and stormed Fort Amsterdam, which was defended by 270 Dutch troops. The fort was carried after ten minutes of fighting, after which two smaller forts, a citadel and the entire town were also taken. More troops were landed while the ships sailed round the harbour to attack Fort République. By 10 am the fort had surrendered, and by noon the entire island had capitulated.
"Anson" had seven men wounded. In all, the British lost three killed and 14 wounded. On the ships alone, the Dutch lost six men killed, including Commandant Cornelius J. Evertz, who commanded the Dutch naval force in Curaçao, and seven wounded, of whom one died later. With the colony, the British captured the frigate "Kenau Hasselar", the sloop "Suriname" (a former Royal Naval sloop), and two naval schooners.
"Anson" was sent back to Britain carrying the despatches and captured colours. The dramatic success of the small British force carrying the heavily defended island was rewarded handsomely. Brisbane was knighted, and the captains received swords, medals and vases.
In 1847 the Admiralty authorised the issue of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp "Curacoa 1 Jany. 1807" to any surviving claimants from the action; 65 medals were issued.
Wreck.
After a period refitting in Britain "Anson" was assigned to the Channel Fleet and ordered to support the blockade of Brest by patrolling off Black Rocks. She sailed from Falmouth on 24 December, and reached Ile de Bas on 28 December 1807. With a severe storm developing from the south west, Lydiard decided to return to port. He made for the Lizard, but in the poor weather, came up on the wrong side and became trapped on a lee shore off Mount's Bay near Penzance, in Cornwall with breakers ahead and insufficient room to sail out to the open seas. "Anson" rolled heavily in rough seas, having retained the spars from her days as a 64-gun ship after she had been razeed. Lydiard's only option was to anchor off Loe Bar. The storm caused the first anchor cable to snap at 4 am on the morning of 29 December. "Anson"s smaller anchor cable broke at 7 am and she was soon being driven onto the shore. With no anchors, Lydiard, in the hope of saving as many lives as possible, attempted to beach her on what he thought was a suitable beach. It was only upon impact that he discovered that it was a sandbar that covered rocks dividing Loe Pool from the open sea. The wind and waves caused the ship to roll broadside on and her mainmast snapped. a sheet anchor was let out, which righted the ship only before it snapped at 8 am.
As hundreds of spectators watched from nearby settlements the pounding surf prevented boats from being launched from the ship or the shore, and a number of the crew were swept away. Some managed to clamber along the fallen main-mast to the shore. Captain Lydiard remained aboard to oversee the evacuation. About 2 pm the ship began to break up, which allowed a few more men to emerge from the wreck, with one being saved. By 3 pm no trace of the ship remained.
Survivors were taken to Helston, two miles away and later sent on to Falmouth.
Estimates of the number of lives lost vary from sixty to 190. Captain Lydiard and "Anson"s first-lieutenant was among the casualties; Lydiard's body was recovered on 1 January 1808 and taken to Falmouth for burial with full military honours. Most of the other victims were buried in pits dug on unconsecrated ground on the cliffs with no burial rites. The death toll is uncertain as some of the survivors had been press ganged and took the opportunity to desert.
Post script.
The loss of "Anson" caused controversy at the time, because of the treatment of the dead sailors washed ashore. In those days it was customary to bury drowned seamen unceremoniously, without shroud or coffin in unconsecrated ground, with bodies remaining unburied for long periods of time. This controversy led to a local solicitor, Thomas Grylls, drafting a new law to provide drowned seamen more decent treatment. John Hearle Tremayne, Member of Parliament for Cornwall, introduced the bill which was enacted as the Burial of Drowned Persons Act 1808. A monument to the drowned sailors, and to passing of the Grylls Act, stands at the eastern end of Loe Bar, on the cliff above the beach, about 1.5 miles from Porthleven Harbour
Henry Trengrouse, a Cornish resident of the area, witnessed "Anson"s wreck. Distressed by the loss of life caused by the difficulties in attaching lines to the wreck, he developed a rocket apparatus to shoot lines across the surf to shipwrecks enabling the rescue of survivors in cradles. This was an early form of the breeches buoy. An example of his life-saving apparatus is on display at Helston Folk Museum. Two of her cannon now guard the entrance of Porthleven Harbour; they were recovered in 1961 from the sands at Loe Bar, the site of the wreck.

Virginia State Route 22

State Route 22 (SR 22) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs from U.S. Route 250 in Shadwell east to US 522 and SR 208 in Mineral. SR 22 is one of two primary east–west highways in Louisa County, connecting the county seat of Louisa with Charlottesville and Mineral. The state highway runs concurrently with US 33 through Louisa and with SR 208 between Louisa and Mineral.
Route description.
SR 22 begins at a tangent intersection with US 250 (Richmond Road) in the community of Shadwell in eastern Albemarle County. The state highway heads northeast as Louisa Road, a two-lane undivided road that parallels CSX's Piedmont Subdivision and passes under Interstate 64. The state highway and railroad diverge in the hamlet of Keswick. SR 22 meets the southern end of SR 231 (Gordonsville Road) in Cismont and crosses over the Piedmont Subdivision rail line in Cobham before entering Louisa County. The state highway intersects US 15 in the hamlet of Boswells Tavern, also known as Waldrop, and crosses the upper reaches of the South Anna River.
SR 22 begins to run concurrently with US 33 (Spotswood Trail) at Trevilians, where the state highway begins to parallel the railroad again. The two highways enter the town of Louisa as Main Street. At the east end of the downtown area, SR 22 and US 33 intersect SR 208 (Courthouse Road), which joins the two other highways east a short distance to where US 33 diverges as Jefferson Highway. SR 22 and SR 208 continue east parallel to the railroad along Davis Highway, which passes to the north of Louisa County Airport. East of Louisa County High School, the two highways turn south into the town of Mineral, where the two highways follow Piedmont Avenue. SR 22 reaches its eastern terminus at the highways' intersection with US 522. US 522 heads south as Mineral Avenue through downtown Mineral. The northbound direction of the U.S. Highway and SR 208 turn east onto 1st Street, cross the railroad tracks at grade, then turn north on Louisa Avenue to exit the town.

Philibert Delavigne

Philibert Delavigne (c. 1700–1750) was a French composer.
Little is known of his life, except that he was active at the court of Louis XV and entered the service of the Comte d'Ayen around 1730.
Only three sets of compositions by Delavigne survive:
Titles for those sonatas are as follows: 
1. "La Baussan" (C major) 
2. "La d'Agut" (C minor)
3. "La Dubois" (C major)
4. "La Beaumont" (C major)
5. "La Persan" (G major)
6. "La Simianne" (G major)
All these compositions are described in their full titles as suitable for musette de cour, hurdy-gurdy and recorder violin or transverse flute.
Robert A. Green explains that the composer's preference was always shown by the exact order in which the instruments are named.
According to this principle, Delavigne's surviving works were composed for musette even though they remain eminently accessible for the hurdy-gurdy.

Frank Bancroft

Francis Carter Bancroft (May 9, 1846 – March 30, 1921) was an American manager in Major League Baseball for the Worcester Ruby Legs, Detroit Wolverines, Cleveland Blues, Providence Grays, Indianapolis Hoosiers, and Cincinnati Reds of the National League, as well as the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association. His greatest success came with the Grays, when he won the 1884 World Series with a record of 84–28 (.750 winning percentage). His stops with teams were short, usually in an interim role, with his last stop being with the Reds after Bid McPhee left the job as manager. Bancroft was 56 years old at the time. (*According to the book Opening Day, Bancroft was the Reds business manager from 1892 - 1920. He was a promotional genius and in 1895, with the help of Reds captain Buck Ewing as a local draw, the first parade included a marching band and was headed up by a three-car streetcar. The streets were a congested mass of humanity, and "Banny" knew this was the start of something BIG for the Queen City!) 
Bancroft served in the 8th New Hampshire Infantry Regiment of the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was a drummer, and was wounded in New Orleans. After recovering, he returned to his regiment and achieved the rank of bugler. He died in Cincinnati at age 74.

List of lord mayors of Manchester

This is a list of the lord mayors of the City of Manchester in the North West of England. Not to be confused with the Directly elected Greater Manchester mayor.
The current and 126th lord mayor is Paul Andrews, Labour, who has served Since May 2024, and was elected councillor for the Moston ward.
The lord mayor position, is selected by a vote of councillors, and is a ceremonial role, with the holder attending civic events, promoting chosen causes and chairing meetings of Manchester City Council, while acting as a city Ambassador. The lord mayor’s term lasts for one year, and a new lord mayor Is elected in a full council meeting, usually in May. 
History.
Manchester was incorporated in 1838 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 as the Corporation of Manchester or Manchester Corporation. It achieved city status in 1853, only the second such grant since the Reformation. The area included in the city has been increased many times, in 1885 (Bradford, Harpurhey and Rusholme), 1890 (Blackley, Crumpsall, part of Droylsden, Kirkmanshulme, Moston, Newton Heath, Openshaw, and West Gorton), 1903 (Heaton), 1904 (Burnage, Chorlton cum Hardy, Didsbury, and Moss Side), 1909 (Gorton, and Levenshulme), 1931 (Wythenshawe: Baguley, Northenden, and Etchells), and Ringway. A new town hall was opened in 1877 (by Alderman Abel Heywood) and the then-current and future mayors of Manchester were granted the title of "Lord Mayor" in 1893. Anthony Marshall was the last mayor and the first lord mayor.
In 1984, the city council – at that time controlled by the Labour party – voted to reduce the pomp and rate-payer cost associated with the position, changing the title to "Chair of the Manchester City Council" (often shortened), following the lead of some Greater London boroughs. This change dispensed with the elaborate robes and chain of office (a gilded ornament worn on the shoulders and around the neck), and no longer provided the traditional tax-funded, eight-room apartment for the officeholder to live in (instead opening this fancy traditional residence to the public as a tourist attraction). These changes were unpopular in the area, especially after focused agitation against them by the "Manchester Evening News", which labelled them a political move originated by non-local leftist activists. The title "Lord Mayor" continued to be used frequently, especially outside the city council. The first of the three successive chairs of council was Kenneth Strath in the 1985–1986 term, and the last was Eileen Kelly, 1987–1988, Later officeholders were referred to again as lord mayors consistently, and permitted to use the traditional vestments associated with the office. Today, vestments have returned and the title Lord Mayor is used.

<doc id="7006970" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7006970" title="Carlo Rosselli">
Carlo Rosselli

Carlo Alberto Rosselli (16 November 18999 June 1937) was an Italian political leader, journalist, historian, philosopher and anti-fascist activist, first in Italy and then abroad. He developed a theory of reformist, non-Marxist socialism inspired by the British labour movement that he described as "liberal socialism". Rosselli founded the anti-fascist militant movement . Rosselli personally took part in combat in the Spanish Civil War, where he served on the Republican side.
Life.
Birth, war and studies.
Rosselli was born in Rome to a wealthy Tuscan Jewish family. His mother, Amelia Pincherle Rosselli, had been active in republican politics and thought and had participated in the unification of Italy. She was also a playwright and children's book author. In 1903 he was taken to Florence with his mother and siblings. During the First World War he joined the Italian Armed Forces and fought in the alpine campaign, rising to the rank of second lieutenant.
After the war, thanks to his brother Nello, he studied in Florence with Gaetano Salvemini, who was to be from then a constant companion of both the Rosselli brothers. It was in this period that he became a socialist, sympathetic to the reformist ideas of Filippo Turati, in contrast to the revolutionary thinking of Giacinto Menotti Serrati. In 1921 he graduated with a degree in political sciences from the University of Florence with a thesis titled: "sindacalismo" (Syndicalism). Later he undertook a law degree that he would pursue in Turin and Milan, where he met Luigi Einaudi and Piero Gobetti.
He graduated in 1923 from the University of Siena. For some weeks he visited London where he studied the workings of the British Labour Party: the Labour movement in the UK would deeply influence him.
Rise of Fascism.
An active supporter of the Unitary Socialist Party of Turati, Matteotti and Treves, he began writing for "Critica Sociale", a review edited by Turati. After the murder of Matteotti, Rosselli pushed for a more active opposition to Fascism. With the help of Ernesto Rossi and Gaetano Salvemini he founded the clandestine publication "Non mollare" ("Don't give up"). During the following months, fascist violence towards the left became increasingly severe. Ernesto Rossi left the country for France, followed by Salvemini. On 15 February 1926, fellow activist Piero Gobetti died as an exile in Paris for the consequences of a fascist aggression which happened in Turin the year before. Still in Italy, Rosselli and Pietro Nenni founded the review "Quarto Stato", which was banned after a few months.
Later in 1926, he organized with Sandro Pertini and Ferruccio Parri the escape of Turati to France. While Pertini followed Turati to France, Parri and Rosselli were captured and convicted for their roles in Turati's escape and sentenced to a period of confinement on the island of Lipari (1927). It was then that Rosselli began to write his most famous work, "Liberal Socialism". In July 1929 he escaped to Tunisia, from where he travelled to France, and the community of Italian antifascists including Emilio Lussu and Francesco Fausto Nitti. Nitti later portrayed Rosselli's adventurous escape in the book "Le nostre prigioni e la nostra evasione" ("Our Prisons and Our Escape") in an Italian edition in 1946 (the 1929 English first edition was titled "Escape").
Exile in Paris and Giustizia e Libertà.
In 1929, with Cianca, Lussu, Nitti, and a Parisian circle of refugees which had formed around Salvemini, Rosselli helped found the anti-fascist movement "Giustizia e Libertà". GL various numbers of the review and the notebooks omonimi (with cadence weekly magazine and salary) and was active in the organization of various spectacular actions, notable among which was the flight over Milan of Bassanesi (1930). In 1930 he published, in French, "Socialisme Libéral".
The book was at once a passionate critique of Marxism, a creative synthesis of the democratic socialist revisionism (Bernstein, Turati and Treves) and of classical Italian Liberalism (Benedetto Croce, Francisco Saverio Merlino and Gaetano Salvemini). But it contained also a shattering attack on the Stalinism of the Third International, which had, with the derisive formula of "social fascism", lumped together social democracy, bourgeois liberalism and fascism. It was not surprising, therefore, when one of the most important Italian Communists, Togliatti, defined "liberal Socialism" as "libellous anti-socialism" and Rosselli "a reactionary ideologue who has nothing to do with the working class".
Giustizia e Libertà joined the Concentrazione Antifascista Italiana (The Italian Anti-Fascist Concentration), a union of all the non-communist anti-fascist forces (republican, socialist, nationalist) trying to promote and coordinate expatriate actions to fight fascism in Italy. They also first published a weekly political magazine entitled "Giustizia e Libertà". Rosselli was the founding editor of the weekly and served in the post from 1934 to 1937. Following his assassination in 1937 Alberto Cianca replaced him in the post.
After the advent of Nazism in Germany (1933), the paper began to call for insurgency, revolutionary action, and military action in order to stop the Italian and German regimes before they plunge Europe into a tragic war. Spain, they wrote, seems the destiny of all fascist states.
Spanish Civil War.
In July 1936, the Spanish Civil War erupted as the fascist-monarchical led army attempted a coup d'état against the republican government of the Popular Front. Rosselli helped lead the Italian anti-fascist supporters of the republican forces, criticizing the neutrality policy of France and Britain, especially as Italy and Germany sent arms and troops in support of the rebels. In August, Rosselli and the GL organized their own brigades of volunteers to support the Spanish Republic.
With Camillo Berneri, Rosselli headed the Matteotti Battalion, a mixed volunteer unit of anarchist, liberal, socialist and communist Italians. The unit was sent to the Aragon front, and participated in a victory against Francoist forces in the Battle of Monte Pelato. Speaking on Barcelona Radio in November, Rosselli made famous the slogan: "Oggi in Spagna, domani in Italia" ("Today in Spain, tomorrow in Italy").
After falling ill, Rosselli was sent back to Paris, from where he led support for the anti-fascist cause, and proposed an even broader 'popular front' while still remaining critical of the Communist Party of Spain and the Soviet government of Joseph Stalin. In 1937, Berneri was killed by Communist forces during a purge of anarchists in Barcelona. With the fall of the Spanish Republic in 1939, Giustizia e Libertà partisans were forced to flee back to France.
Murder.
In June 1937, Carlo Rosselli and his brother visited the French resort town of Bagnoles-de-l'Orne. On 9 June, the two were killed by a group of "cagoulards", militants of the Cagoule, a French fascist group. Archival documents would later implicate Mussolini's regime in authorizing the murder. The two brothers were buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris but in 1951 the family moved them to Italy into the Monumental Cemetery of Trespiano, a frazione of Florence.
His British-origin wife Marion Catherine Cave, their three children, Giovanni Andrea "John", Amelia "Melina", and Andrew, and his mother Amelia Pincherle Rosselli survived him.
Thought.
Carlo Rosselli published only one book, "Liberal Socialism". This work marked Rosselli out as a heretic in the Italian left of his time (for which Karl Marx's "Das Kapital", albeit variously understood, was still regarded as the only reliable source of political analysis and guidance). Undoubtedly the influence of the British labour movement, which he knew well, is visible. As a result of the electoral successes of the Labour Party, Rosselli was convinced that the 'norms' of liberal democracy were essential, not only in building Socialism, but also for its concrete realization. This stands in contrast to Leninist tactics which prioritize organizational power over democratic procedures. This 'Rossellian' synthesis is that "[parliamentary] liberalism is the method, Socialism is the aim".
The Marxist–Leninist idea of revolution founded on the dictatorship of the proletariat (which he felt, as in the Russian case, was synonymous with the dictatorship of a single party) he rejected in favour of a revolution that—as famously put in the GL program—is a coherent system of structural reforms aimed at the construction of a Socialism; that does not limit, but indeed exalts, freedom of personality and of association. Writing in his final years, Rosselli became more radical in his liberal positions, defending the social organization of the CNT-FAI he had seen in anarchist Catalonia and Barcelona during the civil war, and informed by the rise of Nazi Germany.

Vero Theatre

The Vero Theatre (also known as the Florida Theatre or Theatre Plaza) is a historic theater in Vero Beach, Florida. Located at 2036 14th Avenue, the Vero Theatre was designed in the Mediterranean Revival style by architect F.H. Trimble. It opened on October 14, 1924, as the city's first motion picture theater with its first feature film being the Hunchback of Notre Dame. The theatre became the center of the fight to remove Indian River from St. Lucie County as a result of local blue laws prohibiting Sunday film viewing. Governor John W. Martin created Indian River County in the theatre in May 1925. On April 28, 1992, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The Theatre closed in 1985 when other multiplex theatres opened nearby. The last film shown was Desperately Seeking Susan.
The building is one of the few remaining structures of the original downtown. It is currently vacant, though there have been numerous attempts made to renovate the structure. The last attempt at renovation was done by developer Robert L. Brackett. His attempts were halted by the storms of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season.

Street of Riches

Street of Riches ("fr." Rue Deschambault) is a novel by the Canadian author Gabrielle Roy. It was originally published in French as "Rue Deschambault" by Beauchemin in 1955. An English translation by Harry L. Binsse, "Street of Riches", was published by McClelland and Stewart in 1957.
Largely autobiographical, it traces the growth and development of a young girl into an accomplished writer. Like much of Roy's fiction, it includes a very autobiographical style and weaves vignettes into a tapestry of the specific time and place. The book covers themes including the social divide between the French Canadian and English Canadian communities in what were the twin cities of St. Boniface and Winnipeg, Manitoba, European immigration to the Canadian prairies, family dynamics and racial integration.
According to literary criticism, the novel is part of the realistic movement.

Olympia Theater (Miami)

The Olympia Theater is a theater located in Miami, Florida. Designed by John Eberson in his famed atmospheric style, the theater opened in 1926. Throughout its history, the venue has served as a movie theater, concert venue and performing arts center. In 1984, it received historical designation by the NRHP. The Olympia Theatre, the Florida Theatre, and the Tampa Theatre are the only remaining atmospheric theatres in Florida.
Background.
In 1924, Paramount Enterprises, Inc. commissioned a theater in the South Florida area. Cities chosen for consideration were: Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Tampa and Sarasota. Architect John Eberson was hired to design the theater, after the success of his work with the Majestic Theatre in Dallas, Texas. Blueprints were completed in December 1924. Miami was chosen as the city and the theater was built on the site of the former "Airdome", an open-air movie theater.
Construction began in May 1925 for the "Miami Theatre and Office Building". Eberson designed the theater to replicate a Spanish garden. The venue was completed in January 1926. The venue was renamed the "Olympia Theater and Office Building" by the wife of the land owner, Mrs. A.E. Rickmers. The name was changed to match its Mediterranean design style. The theater opened on February 18, 1926 as a silent movie theater.
As the movie entertainment changed, so did the purpose of the theater. By 1929, talking pictures and vaudeville grew in popularity. The theater began to host many acts including the Marx Brothers and Gypsy Rose Lee. By the 1950s, the theater hosted numerous concerts. The theater gained notoriety after 15 sold-out performances by Elvis Presley in August 1956. The 50s and 60s saw performances from Etta James, Della Reese and B.B. King.
By the late 1960s, the use of the theater declined. Plans were underway to demolish the theater and convert the space into a parking lot. In 1970, the venue was purchased by businessman and philanthropist, Maurice Gusman. He later hired famed local architect, Morris Lapidus to renovated the main auditorium. The capacity was reduced from 2,000 to 1,700. In 1972, the renovated theater became the home of the Greater Miami Philharmonic Orchestra.
In 1975, Gusman donated the property to the City of Miami. Renovations continued on the theater from 1975 to 1977. The former movie palace was converted to a rock concert venue and named the "Gusman Cultural Center". With the new era, the theater hosted concerts by Jimmy Buffett, The Police, Molly Hatchet, Devo and Supertramp.
In 1984, the theater was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. However, the theater faced another decline in the late 80s. This time, plans included converting the property into a retail space. The Gusman Estate moved against the changes and created a non-profit organization, the Friends of Gusman, to help create funds to improve the aging building. Renovations began in 1989 to convert the former rock venue into a performing arts center. The theater reopened in 1994. The theater changed names once again to the "Gusman Center for the Performing Arts". The venue continued to concerts by the Florida Philharmonic (defunct), Annie Lennox, Luciano Pavarotti and Johnny Cash.
In 2000, restoration work began on the theater's original artwork. Also, plans were underway to repair the building's structure and exterior frame. The venue had a grand reopening in October 2002, under the name the "Olympia Theater at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts". In 2009, another rounds of renovations began to repair the stage, acoustics, HVAC systems, replace seating and restore the original Olympia marquee. Capacity was reduced from 1,700 to 1,500.
In 2010, the Olympia Center, Inc. was formed to manage and operate the venue. The team works with various promotion companies including AEG Live, Shock Entertainment, the Rhythm Foundation and Poplife. In 2014, the venue changed to its original name, "Olympia Theater". Concerts included Bryan Adams, Kraftwerk and Damien Rice.
The cost and effort of maintaining a COVID-19 pandemic shuttered venue with major capital needs and urgent repairs was not sustainable. The Board of Directors and Executive Staff faced the difficult decision to return management and operation of the historic Olympia Theater &amp; Office Building to the City of Miami in 2020.
Significance.
On April 18, 2012, the American Institute of Architects's Florida Chapter placed the building on its list of "Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places" as the Olympia Theater at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts.

Trollius asiaticus

Trollius asiaticus, the Asian globeflower, is a species of ornamental plant in the family Ranunculaceae, which is native to Asia and Europe. This plant usually grows in wet places, especially in grasslands and forests. It commonly grows to about 20 cm or higher.
Trollius asiaticus, exhibits considerable variability in the morphology of its flowers and leaves. The adaptability can be seen by subtle shifts in sepal lengths, petal widths and beak sizes. 
Trollius asiaticus, is considered to be a key ancestral specie as it acts a maternal form from which other species such as T. altaicus "and T. sajanensis" have evolved. 
In high mountains and midlands, there is a variety of single plants. However, these cannot be referred to T. asiaticus , as they don't have the main diagnostic characteristic as their petals are considerably shorter. These forms were identified as "T. vitalli, T. sajanesis and T. sibiricus" which were found in the most eastern part of the Western Sayan and in the upper Naryn River.

László Bodrogi

László Bodrogi (born 11 December 1976 in Budapest, Hungary) is a Hungarian and French former professional road bicycle racer, specializing in the individual time trial.
Biography.
László was born in 1976 in Budapest, Hungary. His father, László Bodrogi, managed his career from his childhood.
Early success in Hungary.
In the nineties, Hungarian bicycle manufacturer Schwinn-Csepel (successor of Csepel) was his main sponsor. In turn, he was the main athlete of the company. Among other products, he tested and raced the Schwinn-Csepel magnesium alloy road frame. He competed in various Hungarian teams, including FTC (1991), BVSC-Intertraverz (1992), KSI (1993) and Stollwerck-FTC (1994).
Moving to France.
In 1995, after his father got a job as a doctor in France, László settled down in France and started training in the AC Bisontine team. He quit his university studies to devote his life to his sports career. After a fruitful season in 1996, he was invited to VC Lyon (VC Vaux-en-Velin), the youth team of Festina. After Festina was shaken by the doping scandals of the Tour de France, Laszlo got little attention from the team. He moved on to CC Étupes in 1999.
Professional career.
In 2000, he started his professional cycling career in and won the bronze in the world championship. In 2007, he scored the best result of the Hungarian cycling history by winning the silver medal in the same discipline after Fabian Cancellara.
He raced in the Tour de France in 2005 and finished in 119th place. At the time, he was the only Hungarian cyclist to have participated in the Tour.
After gaining French citizenship in 2008, he rides for France now. 
Consequently, he resigned from participating in the Hungarian championship. Between 1997 and 2008, he won the national road champion title three and the individual time trial champion title ten times.
He suffered a leg injury at the Tour of Germany in 2008, resulting in an 8-month recovery period. After Credit Agricole ceased sponsoring its cycling team, László joined the Katusha team. In 2010, he started preparing for the world championship, although the riders are not qualified yet.
He lives with his family in Ney. He is married to a French woman, Catherine, and has two children.

Highly Strung

Highly Strung is the sixth studio album by English guitarist and songwriter Steve Hackett. "Cell 151" was a minor hit from the album, and charted in the UK. Added to Hackett's band was drummer Ian Mosley, who would join Marillion in 1984. This was Hackett's final studio release for Charisma.
In 2007, "Highly Strung" was remastered and re-released on Virgin Records. The new edition features updated liner notes and three bonus tracks.
The front cover painting is, as on many of Hackett's albums, by his then-wife Kim Poor.
Background.
By the time Hackett started work on "Highly Strung" his relationship with management at Charisma Records, with whom he had been signed since the beginning of his solo career, had started to decline. The label began to interfere with Hackett's creative decisions, and the guitarist had noticed that the company was "in disarray" at the time. His wish to cater to audience demands and have a live album released went against the label's wishes. He added: "A&amp;R were starting to make comments and requests which didn't fit the MD's ideas and it left me in the middle trying to steer a sensible course". The result led to "Highly Strung" being a difficult album for Hackett to complete, a process that lasted eighteen months. Among the difficulties faced was the label's suggestion for Hackett to work with a producer from the beginning, but the guitarist recalled that Charisma failed to agree on one. In addition, Hackett said that management disliked the end product due to his decision to sing lead vocals when they were against the idea. Eight different mixes of "Cell 151" were produced and played back to management at Charisma. Hackett found the experience unpleasant and compared it to an audition for winning the support of a label.
Hackett looked back on the album and rated "Highly Strung" as a fragmented album, "possibly falling into two halves of the song type and the blowing type", with "Camino Royale" being an example song that had more drive.

Dominique Mamberti

Dominique François Joseph Mamberti (; born 7 March 1952) is a French Catholic prelate who has served as Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura since 2014. He was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2015. In 2025, serving as the cardinal protodeacon, he announced the election of Pope Leo XIV from the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica following the 2025 papal conclave.
Early life and education.
Dominique Mamberti was born to French parents in Marrakesh, Morocco, on 7 March 1952 and was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Ajaccio, France, on 20 September 1981. He has academic degrees in civil and canon law. He entered the Holy See's diplomatic service and worked in the apostolic nunciatures in Algeria, Chile and Lebanon, in the Holy See's office at United Nations headquarters in New York City and in the Section for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State (Holy See).
Mamberti is considered an expert on Latin America, the United Nations, Africa, the Middle East and Islam.
Archbishop.
On 18 May 2002, Pope John Paul II appointed him Titular Archbishop of Sagona and Apostolic Nuncio to Sudan and Apostolic Delegate to Somalia. He received episcopal consecration from Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Sodano on 3 July 2002. On 19 February 2004, he was also appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Eritrea and Somalia was removed from his remit.
Secretary for Relations with States.
He was appointed Secretary for Relations with States by Pope Benedict XVI on 15 September 2006. This post is generally seen as the equivalent of Foreign Minister of the Holy See. In 2007 Archbishop Mamberti was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.
At a meeting in September 2009 between the Kosovan Foreign Minister, Skënder Hyseni, and Mamberti, the Holy See's Secretary for Relations with States, Archbishop Mamberti said that the Holy See was closely following developments in and around Kosovo, and he expressed his willingness to continue and intensify mutual communications. Following a meeting in November 2009 between the Serbian President Boris Tadić and Pope Benedict XVI, Tadić said that the Vatican supported Serbia's integration and membership within the EU and the sovereignty and preservation of its territorial integrity.
In September 2007, Mamberti orchestrated the first official visit between an Arab Head of State, Sudan's President Omar el-Bashir and Pope Benedict. The visit took place at the Pope's Summer residence, Castel Gandolfo. Shortly after this groundbreaking event, the King of Saudi Arabia met the Pope. This marked the beginning of a new period of Catholic-Muslim relations.
In June 2010, Mamberti visited Cuba and spent several days on the island, marking 75 years of diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Cuba and participating in a national conference on the church's social teachings. He met with President Raúl Castro, saying afterwards that bilateral relations are "cordial, continuing and on the rise." "The visit of (Archbishop) Mamberti also showed the favourable development of relations between the state and the Catholic Church in Cuba," the government's note said.
Mamberti, addressing the United Nations, in September 2011, called for "courageous decisions" toward the two-state solution for the Holy Land after Palestinian leaders requested full U.N. membership for the Palestinian state. Archbishop Dominique Mamberti did not say whether the Vatican explicitly supported the Palestinians' U.N. initiative. He added that the Vatican viewed the Palestinian bid "in the perspective of efforts to find a definitive solution" to the Israeli-Palestinian question – an issue addressed by a U.N. resolution of 1947 that foresaw the creation of two states. "One of them has already been created, while the other has not yet been established, although nearly 64 years have passed. The Holy See is convinced that if we want peace, it is necessary to adopt courageous decisions," he said.
At the opening of the UN General Assembly in September 2012, Mamberti said that international law is "solidly based upon the dignity and nature of humanity—in other words, upon the natural law." He called the UN delegates' attention to the language of the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which affirm the importance of the natural law. International law will earn recognition and respect, he said, if it is recognised as protecting every person and nation, not favouring the powerful. "Such will be possible," he said, "if legislation at the international level is marked by respect for the dignity of the human person, beginning with the centrality of the right to life and to freedom of religion."
In a separate address in early October 2012, Mamberti spoke of the theme of the assembly as the "Adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means." In his French-language address, he lamented a "loss of faith in the value of dialogue, and the temptation to favour 'a priori' one of the sides in regional and national conflicts," saying that this threatens "respect for the juridical mechanisms of the United Nations." Archbishop Mamberti referred specifically to situations in the Middle East, particularly in un, "A solution is impossible if it fails to respect the rules of international and humanitarian law, or falls outside the mechanisms established in the United Nations Charter," he stated. "All interested parties should not only facilitate the mission of the special envoy of the United Nations and the Arab League, but also ensure humanitarian assistance to the suffering peoples. The international community must unite its efforts so that all sides replace the race to arms with negotiation, just as it must insist on effective respect for religious liberty, human rights and all fundamental freedoms."
On 16 January 2013, Mamberti gave an interview on Vatican Radio about the Catholic Church's autonomy and religious freedom. He defended the right to a conscience clause for Christian employers who refused services to homosexuals. He opposed increasing secularism.
In July 2014 commenting on the situation in Gaza, Mamberti sent a formal note to all the ambassadors accredited to the Holy See, calling their attention to the appeals by Pope Francis for Christians in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East. Mamberti said that the Holy See is "deeply concerned" with the suffering of Christians in the region. "Christian communities are suffering unjustly, they are scared, and many Christians have been forced to emigrate", he said.
Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura.
On 8 November 2014, Pope Francis appointed Mamberti as Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the final court of appeal for any ecclesiastical judgment, besides the Pope himself. Mamberti succeeded Raymond Leo Cardinal Burke, who was named patron to the Order of Malta.
Cardinal.
On 4 January 2015, Pope Francis announced that he would make Archbishop Mamberti a cardinal on 14 February. At the ceremony, he was appointed Cardinal-Deacon of the titular church of Santo Spirito in Sassia.
On 13 April 2015, Mamberti was named a member of the Board of the Cardinals and Bishops for the Section for Relations with States of the Vatican Cardinal Secretary of State's office, a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, and a member of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints. On 4 October 2017 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.
On 1 July 2024, he became the senior elector among those cardinals with the rank of cardinal deacon. He retained that role when he became the senior member of the order of cardinal deacons, the protodeacon of the College of Cardinals, upon the death of Cardinal Renato Martino on 28 October 2024. Serving as the cardinal protodeacon for the 2025 papal conclave, Mamberti had the duty of announcing the election of Pope Leo XIV to the world. He did not impose the pallium at the papal inauguration of Leo XIV (as expected of the cardinal-protodeacon), because he was in hospital due to cardiac fibrillation.

Polk Theatre (Lakeland, Florida)

The Polk Theatre in Lakeland, Florida is a historic theater located at 121 South Florida Avenue.
The 1,400-seat theatre was built in 1928 after the local business "boom" of the town had ended and despite the fact that the population was only 15,000 inhabitants. In 1982, a group of concerned people banded together to save the theatre from being razed due to low attendance. Local citizens formed a non-profit group, borrowed money, secured a grant from the state, and purchased the theatre for $300,000. The theatre has a mezzanine, a high balcony, a permanent backdrop of a "Venetian piazza," an orchestra pit, a ceiling against which images of twinkling stars are projected, and terrazzo flooring. The air-conditioning system, which was the first in the county, was a pump that used artesian well water to chill the building.
Under the name Polk Theatre and Office Building, the building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

DWAC-TV

DWAC-TV, Channel 23, was the flagship UHF station of Philippine all-sports television network ABS-CBN Sports and Action (S+A), a fully owned subsidiary of ABS-CBN Corporation. Its studios and transmitter are located at ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center, Mother Ignacia Avenue corner Sergeant Esguerra Avenue, Diliman, Quezon City.
History.
The station was acquired from Ermita Electronics Corporation in July 1996, which initially owned the frequency of the station that began airing in May 1992 from a densely populated commercial area in Quezon City with a rebroadcast of MTV Asia, then telecasting from the STAR TV platform. It was later showing Channel [V] refeeds from 1994 onwards as MTV made the decision to split from STAR and form its own satellite TV portal in Asia.
Just two years later in 1996, MTV Asia returned to the Philippine airwaves after establishing a new regional base in Singapore. ABS-CBN was picked as the broadcast arm of MTV Asia in the Philippines at the time, and Channel 23 started test broadcasts in September 1996 with rebroadcasts of the new MTV Asia from Singapore. A month later, it launched its own programming under the station name Studio 23 and adopted the slogan "Premium Television". It also became the first UHF TV station in Metro Manila to broadcast in full surround stereo, and the fourth television station in the country to broadcast in stereo (after GMA-7 in 1987, SBN 21 in 1992, and RPN 9 in 1994). The station initially ran MTV rebroadcasts in the day, and ran its own shows at primetime. It also ran for 24 hours, but later reneging to a 21-hour broadcast (from 6 am to 3 am), owing to financial limitations. That has been the broadcast arrangement ever since.
Five years later, MTV Asia acquired a new local UHF frequency, Channel 41 owned by Nation Broadcasting Corporation (which is now One Sports, now co-owned by TV5) and Studio 23 formally became a full-fledged station, adopting rebroadcasts of its in-house cable channel Myx to fill in the void left by MTV Asia, and came up with intensified programming led by the popular reality TV game show "Survivor", and several top rate US shows like "7th Heaven", "Will and Grace" and "Charmed", among others.
By 2004, the channel opened its doors to Taglish programs. It also by that time adopted a new slogan, "Kabarkada Mo!". Previous to this trend, the station was already running its own English newscast, "News Central", from 1998 to 2010, effectively replacing the network's "News 23". It also geared its mostly young viewers to trends in the tech world with "Digital World". With the intensified Taglish presence, Studio 23 launched the nightly Tagalog gag newscast "Wazzup Wazzup", the interactive youth talk show "Y-Speak", and several others. It even provided support shows to its highly successful local reality programs "Pinoy Big Brother" and "Pinoy Dream Academy", both acquired from Endemol of the Netherlands and are big hits on Channel 2.
Expansion to sports programming.
In 1998, ABS-CBN, through its sports division, ABS-CBN Sports, used Studio 23 to highlight its own professional basketball league, the Metropolitan Basketball Association (MBA). The league adopted the home and away format used by the American professional league the National Basketball Association (NBA). (It however sold the franchise of the league after incurring heavy losses.) It marked the network's first serious foray into sports programming.
Later, that would be added by acquiring broadcast rights to the collegiate leagues UAAP and NCAA and the PBL.
It carried a wide variety of local sporting competitions, many of which involved neighborhood schools and showcasing budding Filipino sports talents.
Rebrand to ABS-CBN Sports+Action.
Sports programming in Channel 23 was fully expanded with the launch of ABS-CBN Sports+Action on January 18, 2014, replacing Studio 23.
On August 29, 2016, in time with the National Heroes Day celebration, ABS-CBN Sports+Action was renamed as simply S+A (S and A).
Shutdown.
On May 5, 2020, S+A Manila went off-air due to the cease and desist order from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) after its franchise expiration.
On January 5, 2022, its former UHF frequencies (channel 23 and 43) were assigned by NTC to Aliw Broadcasting Corporation (for channel 23) and Swara Sug Media Corporation (for channel 43); the former began conducting test broadcast since May 6, 2022.

Riva Ridge

Riva Ridge (April 13, 1969 – April 21, 1985) was a Thoroughbred racehorse, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes in 1972.
Often remembered simply as a stablemate of Secretariat, Riva Ridge was a successful racehorse in his own right, winning 17 of his 30 starts and two championships: American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse in 1971 and American Champion Older Male Horse in 1973. Contrary to popular belief, Riva Ridge's success was largely responsible for saving Meadow Stable from financial ruin.
Background.
Riva Ridge was a light bay stallion who stood 16 hands high. A son of First Landing out of Iberia (by Heliopolis), Riva Ridge and his sire were owned and bred by the Meadow Stable of Christopher Chenery in Doswell, Virginia. Secretariat, the Triple Crown champion in 1973, was owned and bred by the same stable.
Riva Ridge's name came from Chenery's daughter Penny and her husband, John Tweedy, honoring their favorite ski run at Vail, Colorado. Tweedy had trained with the U.S. Army's Tenth Mountain Division in Colorado in 1943, but later served in Burma with the OSS. Upon his return from the war, he and fellow veterans from the Tenth Mountain division founded Vail Ski Resort in Colorado in 1962. They named the longest run "Riva Ridge" after a costly but important strategic victory by the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division on February 18 in the North Apennine mountains of Italy.
In 1971, Meadow Stable was struggling financially. Christopher Chenery was very ill, and Penny wanted to save the operation, at odds with her siblings Hollis and Margaret, who wanted to sell it. Following Riva Ridge's success as a two-year-old, however, Hollis and Margaret stopped pushing for her to sell the farm.
A winner of the Eclipse Award at age two and four, Riva Ridge was ridden mainly by Hall of Fame jockey Ron Turcotte, who also rode stablemate Secretariat a year later. He was trained by Lucien Laurin.
Riva Ridge was described by Penny Chenery as a very timid and unassuming horse who "ran to get away from [other horses]." He was nicknamed "Old Pea Head" while racing.
Racing career.
1971: two-year-old season.
Riva Ridge made his racetrack debut on June 9, 1971, at Belmont Park. Despite going off at 2-1 odds, Riva Ridge was bumped at the start and finished seventh. With blinkers added, he then won in both maiden and allowance company, having broken on the lead in both races. In his stakes debut in the Great American Stakes, he again disappointed as the favorite, finishing eighth.
For his next start in the Flash Stakes at Saratoga Race Course, Riva Ridge benefited from a jockey change to Ron Turcotte. Turcotte guided Riva Ridge back to the rail after he tried to bolt to the outside following the break, resulting in a length victory. Because of Riva Ridge's behavior in the Flash Stakes, Turcotte realized that Riva Ridge had a fear of close quarters caused by the difficult start in his first race. He asked trainer Lucien Laurin if Riva Ridge could take a month away from racing to work on overcoming his fear. Laurin had plans for Riva Ridge to run in other races at Saratoga, so he initially declined Turcotte's request. Turcotte insisted that that month would make a huge difference in Riva Ridge's future career, telling Laurin "you can have a champion or a claimer. It’s your call." Following this, Laurin agreed to allow Turcotte to work Riva Ridge in company, using stable ponies at first and then two other horses from Laurin's barn. Laurin planned to run Riva Ridge in the Hopeful Stakes after Turcotte was finished working with him, but the horse came down with a fever a few hours before the race and had to be scratched. Ultimately, Turcotte's idea worked, and Riva Ridge won four consecutive stakes in the fall of 1971, netting him honors as that year's two-year-old champion.
1972: three-year-old season.
In early 1972, Laurin announced that Riva Ridge would only run in three races prior to the Kentucky Derby, which shocked many observers. In his three-year-old debut, Riva Ridge won the Hibiscus Stakes at Hialeah Park Race Track. He then ran in the Everglades Stakes, but he did not take well to the sloppy track and finished fourth. He then came back and won the Blue Grass Stakes in his final prep race nine days before the Kentucky Derby.
The morning of the Kentucky Derby, Turcotte asked Laurin if he could cut larger holes in Riva Ridge's blinkers because it would help the horse should he need to go to the front early in the race. While Laurin thought it was too late to make changes, he allowed Turcotte to alter the blinkers as long as it wouldn't hurt the horse's chances. In the Derby, the other jockeys held their horses back early on, as Turcotte expected, and Riva Ridge took the lead early, holding it throughout the race to win by lengths.
After his win as the 9-5 favorite at the Kentucky Derby, many expected Riva Ridge to win the Triple Crown. Although a 1-5 odds-on favorite at Pimlico in Baltimore, he finished fourth to longshot Bee Bee Bee, after rain made the going sloppy. Turcotte later said that Riva Ridge "would never feel secure on an off track," indicating the track condition likely factored into the loss. In the -mile (2.4 km) Belmont Stakes, Riva Ridge defeated nine other horses with a seven-length victory.
Later in his three-year-old season, Riva Ridge won the Hollywood Derby by a nose, but then suffered five straight losses, two of which were to eventual champion three-year-old male Key to the Mint. After freshening up and training well in July, Riva Ridge's first race following the Hollywood Derby was the Monmouth Invitational. Before his fourth-place finish, Laurin and Penny Chenery thought he was unusually docile in the saddling paddock and Turcotte described him as having been "dull" in the post parade. When Riva Ridge returned to Saratoga the day after, he tested positive for traces of a tranquilizer derivative, indicating someone had likely given him a tranquilizer between 8 and 48 hours before the race. However, Riva Ridge was not tested immediately after the race by officials and the levels reported were not grounds for any action regardless. Riva Ridge then lost the Stymie Handicap by a neck to Canonero II, winner of 1971's Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, and was off the board in his final three starts, all over off tracks or turf. Riva Ridge is one of five horses who won two of three Triple Crown races but not that year's three-year-old championship.
1973: four-year-old season.
At age four, Riva Ridge developed a kidney condition and a chronic shoulder issue, but still won five of the nine races he entered, set track records four times, and equaled the 1-mile track record at Suffolk Downs in winning the Massachusetts Handicap. His winning time of 1:52 in the Brooklyn Handicap (raced that year at Aqueduct Racetrack) set a world record for 1 miles on the dirt. His mark was equaled by Farma Way in 1991 at Pimlico Race Course. As of January 2008, their record still stands.
With much fanfare, the Philip Morris company (manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes) sponsored what was to be a match race with stablemate Secretariat. After both horses were beaten in preparatory races for the match, it was changed to an invitational race which brought together top horses three years old and up. In record time, Secretariat (ridden by Turcotte) finished first and Riva Ridge (ridden by Eddie Maple) finished second. Both horses surpassed the world record time, though only Secretariat received credit due to his first-place finish. During their careers, both horses wore the blue and white checks of Meadow Stable. In 30 lifetime starts, Riva Ridge won 17 races, finished second three times and third once, with earnings of $1,111,497.
Stud career.
After the death of Christopher Chenery in January 1973, Riva Ridge and his stablemate Secretariat were both sold to breeding syndicates and retired to stud at Claiborne Farm at the end of the 1973 racing season. Riva Ridge was syndicated for $5.12 million, and Secretariat for $6.08 million. Penny Chenery often came back to visit both horses, but over time Secretariat would no longer acknowledge her due to the many visitors he got. Riva Ridge, however, developed a stronger bond with Penny since he was largely overlooked by the general public. "There was never a time when Riva wouldn’t come up to me to say hello," she later said in an interview.
Out of Riva Ridge's 360 named foals, 228 were winners, including 29 stakes winners.
Riva Ridge died of a heart attack in his paddock on April 21, 1985, after a trip to the breeding shed. Claiborne staff saw him fall over in his paddock and immediately rushed over to him, but he had died by the time he hit the ground. He was 16 years old.
Assessment.
In the Top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred Champions of the 20th century, Riva Ridge was ranked No. 57. He was elected to the American Racing Hall of Fame in 1998.

Minnesota Internet Users Essential Tool

Minnesota Internet Users Essential Tool (Minuet) is an integrated Internet package for DOS operating systems on IBM-compatible PCs.
Background.
Minuet was created at the University of Minnesota, in the early days of the World Wide Web (1994–1996). At that time, Internet software for MS-DOS was immature — the only programs available were NCSA Telnet and NCSA FTP. Both are glitchy, hard to configure, and TTY-oriented. 
The microcomputer support department at the university decided to come up with something better. Their design goals were:
The result was "Minuet". Minuet was quite successful at its time, being used at many colleges and institutions. Its usage peaked around 1996, going down as Windows 95 and its free e-mail reader and web browser proliferated.
Implementation.
The program was written in Turbo Pascal, using the Turbo Vision GUI. This base is a good match for the PCs of that time. Turbo Vision in its early incarnations uses the 80×25 character text mode, meaning very speedy screen updates, even on slow PCs. Later Minuet versions - including the last one "1.0 Beta 18A" - also support graphical modes up to 1600 × 1200 pixels (UXGA) while displaying up to 16.7 million colors, depending on the capabilities and VESA compatibility of the hardware used. 
A homebrew multi-tasking kernel allows users to have several Minuet windows active at the same time. An FTP session could be transferring files, while in another window, the user could be composing an e-mail. All the parts of Minuet use multi-tasking, the user does not have to wait for a slow operation to complete.
Features.
Email.
Email in Minuet resembles most standard email programs — "From:", "To:", "cc:", "Bcc:", and "Message body" fields. Attachments use the BinHex and UUCP encoding schemes, which predated MIME and were popular in Minuet's days.
Newsgroups.
In Minuet, Newsgroups appear much like e-mail folders. An innovative concept is included — Minuet would not attempt to download the whole newsgroups file, which even then included thousands of newsgroups. Instead, a Perl server is contacted to search for interesting newsgroups. This cuts down the newsgroup searching startup time from many minutes to a few seconds.
Gopher.
Minuet also comes with a built-in Gopher client.
FTP.
Minuet is one of the first programs to have a graphical tree-structured approach to FTP. At the time, most FTP clients required an almost endless sequence of "cd", "ls" commands to browse servers.
Web browser.
In its last version "1.0 Beta 18A" from 1994, Minuet also includes a WWW browser for the first time. However, it is only HTTP/1.0-compliant, renders web sites in a pre-HTML 2.0 standard and therefore comes with no web form or table support. Later common web browser features such as JavaScript, CSS or proxy server support are not present in this version either. Enabling the graphical mode, however, allows Minuet to directly render GIF and JPEG images in HTML documents, which is a superior feature compared to other DOS-based WWW browsers of the time.
SLIP.
At that time most PC users connected to the internet using a modem, so a robust modem-capable driver was required. Unfortunately, SLIP drivers of the time were poor — hard to configure, difficult to test, missing important features like dialing, and often not using all of the buffering features of the serial port chips. Consequently, the Minuet team developed a SLIP driver and dial-up program.

Sheridan Anderson

Sheridan Andreas Mulholland Anderson (18 September 1936 — 31 March 1984) was an American cartoonist, fly fisherman, outdoorsman, illustrator, author, and sign painter.
He is primarily known for being the author of the cult classic "Curtis Creek Manifesto", a 48-page illustrated guide to fly fishing that has sold close to one million copies and has been reprinted over 20 times since its first publication in 1978.
Biography.
Early life.
Anderson was born on September 18, 1936, in Los Angeles. His father, first enrolled in the Army, then a car salesman, moved the family to Salt Lake City where Anderson spent most of his early life drawing and painting.
His uncle-in-law Grant was the only angler among his relatives and the one that taught him fly fishing on the rivers of West Yellowstone and Montana.
While Anderson studied art at the University of Utah, he dropped out after two semesters, never completing his studies. Afterwards he attended some college courses around the Western United States, spending most of his 20s wandering from place to place.
60s and 70s at Camp 4.
In his vagabonding Anderson eventually met climbers that led him to Camp 4, a campground in Yosemite National Park that was the epicenter of the American rock climbing scene during the 60s. Camp 4 attracted pioneers such as Chuck Pratt, Steve Roper, Yvon Chouinard and Royal Robbins, whom Anderson befriended. He was especially close to Chouinard, Patagonia's founder, whom he used to fish with. While not as skilled a climber, Anderson partook in at least two first ascents: Andy’s Inferno in 1964, and Aunt Fanny’s Pantry in 1965.
Anderson spent nearly two decades embedded in Camp 4's climbing community, taking on the role of unofficial artist-in-residence and gaining a reputation for using his satirical cartoons to poke fun at any climbing star who dared to take themselves too seriously. During this time he also applied his artistry beyond the campground, illustrating how-to climbing books "Basic Rockcraft" and "Advanced Rockcraft" written by Royal Robbins, as well as contributing words and cartoons to climbing magazines such as "Summit" (America’s first monthly climbing magazine), "Ascent", "Mountain", and "Mountain Gazette". During this time, trying not to be recognized by the publishers of "Summit", he took on the pen name of "E. Lovejoy Wolfinger III" so that he could contribute to the short-lived, off-color, climbing zine "Vulgarian Digest."
When he wasn't spending summers in Yosemite, Anderson wintered in places like Reno, Bishop, and, mostly, San Francisco, where he sometimes made ends meet as a sign painter and regularly haunted the Golden Gate casting ponds and local fly shops.
While the details of the accident remained contested, a vertebrae fracture in 1971 forced Anderson to stop climbing completely.""
Writing "Curtis Creek Manifesto".
The idea for "Curtis Creek Manifesto" began to form at Camp 4, where Anderson had to "[supply] a half-dozen fellow pirates with fresh trout" and reported being encouraged to monetize his talents—fishing and drawing—so as to live his bohemian lifestyle more comfortably.
Anderson wanted to co-write the book with his uncle Grant, the master angler that taught him how to fly fish, but Grant turned him down saying the book was "his baby" and encouraged him to continue pursuing it alone. Grant is credited in the "Acknowledgements and Thanks" section of the final book as the "best fly fisherman [Anderson] ever knew" and thanked for "his genius" without which the book "would have never been possible."
During one of his stays in San Francisco Anderson drew the first 15 pages of the book. Despite a couple of rejections from publishers who thought the book was not "sophisticated enough"' he sent the pages, unsolicited, to a publisher in Milwaukie, Oregon, Frank Amato. Amato's reaction was enthusiastic and for the first time he flew to meet a potential author. The book was published in 1978, virtually unedited, and was met with immediate success.'
Later life.
After publishing the book, Anderson worked with Early Winters to create the "Curtis Creek Stalker", a set of fly-fishing equipment that included a custom-made four-piece fiberglass pack rod, a nylon shoulder bag that doubled as a creel, a tackle bag, a Ryobi 355 single-action reel, a weight-forward Scientific Anglers fly line, leaders, tippets, flies, hook hone, fly floatant, clippers, knife, flashlight, and a copy of "Curtis Creek Manifesto".
In the late 70s Anderson was forced by his asthma and emphysema to move out of San Francisco and relocate to better climates. Living off of the royalties from the book, the modest revenue from "Curtis Creek Stalker", and the occasional stint as a fly fishing guide for the Sierras, Anderson bought a weathered cabin in the high desert around Chiloquin, Oregon, close to the Williamson and Sprague rivers.' He shared the cabin, dubbed by Anderson as the "Visqueen Manor", with Polly Rosborough, a pioneer of modern fly-fishing and author of "Tying and Fishing the Fuzzy Nymph". While he spent summers in Chiloquin, the winters proved too harsh for his ailments and he regularly relocated to Las Vegas, where he stayed with his grandmother Hazel.'
In 1980 Anderson wrote and illustrated "Baron Von Mabel's Backpacking", a humorous guide for beginning backpackers, later translated into German and reprinted in 1993.
Death and posthumous work.
On 31 March 1984 Sheridan, 47 years old, died in Las Vegas of an acute attack of emphysema.""
Michael Sheridan, his younger brother, hired a plane and spread Anderson's ashes in the Golden Trout Wilderness, near Lone Pine, an area that Sheridan explored thoroughly, fishing its streams and high mountain lakes.
In 1989, climbing writer Joe Kelsey edited "The Climbing Cartoons of Sheridan Anderson", a posthumous collection of Anderson's cartoons from published and unpublished sources.
The legacy of "Curtis Creek Manifesto".
The "Curtis Creek Manifesto" was successful right from the start, selling thousands of copies. By the end of the 80s it was translated and sold in Germany as well as Japan, where it sold particularly well.' By 2004 it had sold nearly 300,000 copies, and as of 2024 it has sold near one million copies, experiencing continuous publication with over 20 reprints.'
The book has become a cult classic known to be one of the most enduring fly fishing manuals, something that "almost every fly fisherman has, knows, or recommends." Patagonia's founder Yvon Chouinard described it as "probably the best beginner’s treatise on how to fly-fish."
In the book Anderson urged its readers "to go forth and seek [their] own Curtis Creek — a delightful, unspoiled stretch of water that [they] will cherish above all others." Its publisher, Frank Amato, said that “other than Isaak Walton, [Anderson is] probably the single American who got more people fishing than anyone else.”
Personal life.
Anderson, who in adulthood reached over 6 feet and weighed over 200 pounds, was often described as making a strong impression, a ragged and rugged "big man with a full chest" that "talked with a growl" and had a "laugh you could hear all over the lodge". He was often compared to a pirate due to his long dark hair, his limp, and his all-black clothing which included the signature black cape that he wore even while fishing. He self-described as an "angler, artist, wanderer, eternal foe of the work ethic."
His parents did not have a peaceful marriage, with frequent spats often fueled by alcohol. Anderson himself was notorious for drinking often and abundantly, showing up in camp with a bottle of Jack Daniel's, emptying his friend's cabinets and drunkenly calling them in the middle of the night. He is reported to have said "from the first drink I ever had, I knew this was what I wanted to do."
Anderson married and divorced twice, both marriages childless and lasting less than two years. He described marriage as "an admission of failure."

Momčilo Đujić

 
Momčilo Đujić (, ; 27 February 1907 – 11 September 1999) was a Serbian Orthodox priest and Chetnik . He led a significant proportion of the Chetniks within the northern Dalmatia and western Bosnia regions of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a fascist puppet state created from parts of the occupied Kingdom of Yugoslavia during World War II. In this role he collaborated extensively with the Italian and then the German occupying forces against the communist-led Partisan insurgency.
Đujić was ordained as a priest in 1933 and gained a reputation as something of a firebrand in the pulpit. After the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia in 1934, he joined the Chetnik Association of Kosta Pećanac, forming several bands in the Knin region of Dalmatia. The Chetnik Association became a reactionary force used by the central government to oppress the populace. Active in promoting workers' rights, Đujić was briefly jailed for leading a protest by railroad workers, and he was a member of the exclusively-Serb Agrarian Union political party.
After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Croatian Ustaše regime implemented a policy of widespread incarcerations, massacres, forced emigration and murder of Serbs and other groups, but Đujić escaped to the coastal zone annexed by Italy and began recruiting Chetniks in a refugee camp. When a general uprising began in August, Đujić returned to Knin and deployed his Chetniks to defend local Serbs from the Ustaše, and under his command they captured the town of Drvar in the Bosanska Krajina. He then quickly began collaborating with the Italians, gaining their help through signing a non-aggression agreement. At this time, he was still aligned with the insurgency led by the communists. He soon betrayed them and began subverting Partisan units and attacking them alongside the Italians. He formed the Chetnik Dinara Division in early 1942. By mid-1942, Đujić was encouraging his Chetniks to co-operate with NDH forces, and on 1 October Chetniks under his command perpetrated a massacre of nearly 100 Croat civilians in the village of Gata. In early 1943 he attempted to participate on the Axis side in the Case White campaign against the Partisans but this was blocked by the Germans. In August, the Dinara Division suffered significantly at the hands of the Partisans and through desertion. By the time of the Italian capitulation in September it was of little use for offensive operations. When the Germans occupied the area, they restricted it to guarding railway tracks from Partisan sabotage. By November 1943, the Chetnik supreme commander, Draža Mihailović, was ordering Đujić to collaborate with the Germans. In November 1944, Đujić and 4,500 of his Chetniks combined with German and NDH forces in an attempt to defend Knin from the ascendant Partisans. Đujić progressively withdrew his troops until they surrendered to the western Allies in May 1945.
Đujić was tried and convicted "in absentia" for war crimes by the new Yugoslav communist government, which found him guilty of mass murder, torture, rape, robbery, forcible confinement and collaborating with the occupying forces. Included in these charges was responsibility for the deaths of 1,500 people. He eventually emigrated to the United States, settling in California. He played an important role in Serbian émigré circles and founded the Ravna Gora Movement of Serbian Chetniks alongside other exiled Chetnik fighters. He later retired to San Marcos, California. In 1989, Đujić appointed the ultranationalist Serb politician Vojislav Šešelj as a Chetnik "vojvoda". He later stated that he regretted awarding the title to Šešelj due to his involvement with Slobodan Milošević and his Socialist Party. In 1998, Biljana Plavšić, then President of Republika Srpska, presented Đujić with an honorary award. Plavšić was later convicted of crimes against humanity related to her activities during the Bosnian War. Đujić died at a hospice in San Diego in 1999, aged 92. Moves in Serbia to rehabilitate the reputations of Đujić and the Chetnik movement have been criticised as historical revisionism and falsification of history.
Early life, education and priesthood.
Momčilo Đujić was the oldest of three sons and two daughters of Rade Đujić and his wife Ljubica (née Miloš), and was born in the village of Kovačić, near Knin in the Kingdom of Dalmatia, on 27 February 1907. The family was of Bosnian origin. Rade had moved to Kovačić with his disabled Austro-Hungarian Army veteran father, Glišo, and his brother, Nikola, in the late 1880s and lived off his father's army pension for a time. Ljubica hailed from the village of Ljubač, southeast of Knin. Shortly after his marriage to Ljubica, Rade established himself as a successful farmer.
Đujić's mother wished to name him Simo, after his uncle. Đujić's father disliked the name and, having been raised listening to the traditional Balkan a single-string musical instrument, and reciting Serbian epic poetry, named his son after Momchil, a 14th-century brigand in the service of Serbian Emperor Dušan the Mighty. It was not until Momčilo started primary school in 1914 that his mother discovered that he had not been named Simo at his baptism. Đujić finished primary school in 1918 and graduated as the best student in his class. Between 1920 and 1924, he attended lower gymnasium in Knin. After a two-year pause, he began attending the higher gymnasium in Šibenik, but in 1929 decided to leave for Sremski Karlovci, where he would attend the Serbian Orthodox seminary. He graduated from the seminary in 1931. In the same year he published a poetry book, "Emiilijade". He was ordained a priest two years later. In 1931 Đujić was assigned to the Orthodox parish in Strmica, near Kovačić. Shortly before ordination, he married Zorka Dobrijević-Jundžić, the eldest daughter of a wealthy merchant from Bosansko Grahovo. The two were married in the Church of St. George in Knin, where Đujić had been baptised as an infant. Đujić's first child, Siniša, was born in 1934. In 1935, Zorka gave birth to twins, a son named Radomir and a daughter named Radojka.
Đujić and his family were relatively wealthy by the standards of Depression-era Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Đujić consequently became the most influential person in the village. He sought to use his money and influence to help the Serb peasants in the Dalmatian hinterland. In 1934, he organised the construction of the "Petar Mrkonjić" cultural centre in Strmica, financed and oversaw the irrigation of farmland west of Mračaj and approved the casting of a pair of church bells on the Church of St. John the Baptist. The casting of new church bellsthe originals having been destroyed by Austro-Hungarian artillery in 1916was financed with money donated by the Yugoslav government and further improved his reputation among the local population. Đujić's critics accused him of misappropriating funds, which he denied from the pulpit.
Interwar Chetnik Association.
In October 1934, Vlado Chernozemski assassinated Yugoslavia's King Alexander. Đujić was chosen to stand by Alexander's coffin as the funeral train travelled through Knin. On this occasion, he met the future World War II Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović for the first and only time. The king's assassination was partially orchestrated by the Ustaše, a Croatian terrorist organisation at the time. Soon after this, Đujić began carrying arms and organising Serb paramilitary groups in and around Knin. "I knew that the country would not survive", Đujić explained, "because nobody can put Serbs and Croats in the same bag". In late 1934, he met with Kosta Pećanac, the head of the interwar Chetnik Association, and formed eleven Chetnik bands in the vicinity of the town. Chetnik insurgency did not have a long tradition in Dalmatia, and only emerged in the 1930s. Đujić subjected local Serbs to constant propaganda, hoping that it would convince them to join the Chetniks. Most ignored his appeals, and continued living peacefully with their Croat neighbours.
On 9 January 1935, Đujić, with a carbine slung over his back, presided over a gathering of twenty newly recruited Chetniks in the village of Sveti Štefan, just north of Knin, together with gendarmerie "Brigadni đeneral" Ljubo Novaković and one of Pećanac's deputies who brought Chetnik and Sokol insignia from Belgrade. The gathering was held in full view of the villagers, and marked the first time that Đujić publicly donned a Chetnik uniform. On 6 September 1935, Đujić formed a Chetnik organisation in Vrlika. Several months later, he assembled a band of 70 Chetniks in the villages of Otrić and Velika Popina. By this time the Chetnik organisation had transformed from the popular Serb guerrilla bands of the Balkan Wars and World War I into a reactionary force that was used by the central government to oppress the populace.
Đujić became known for his fiery speeches, which earned him the nickname "Father Fire" (). The tone of his speeches changed depending on the course of political developments in Yugoslavia, and his statements ranged from right-wing royalism to left-wing progressivism. At certain points, Đujić appeared to embrace the quasi-fascism of the leader of the Yugoslav National Movement, Dimitrije Ljotić. At others, he strongly propagated conservative Chetnik ideology and Serb chauvinism. Đujić's repeated calls for democracy and national rights prompted the regency of Prince Paul to brand him a "left-wing agitator". He received considerable support from the Serbian Orthodox Church in Knin. He also used his position as a priest and respected local leader to influence how the people of Strmica would vote, instructing his parishioners to cast ballots for a candidate of his choosing in the 1935 Yugoslav parliamentary elections.
In May 1937, Đujić gave a sermon in which he accused the Yugoslav government of being responsible for the poor working conditions of railroad workers in Dalmatia and western Bosnia. In mid-May, Đujić led a massive strike between Bihać and Knin in which more than 10,000 railroad workers participated. The Una–Butužnica railroad was one of eight being built in Yugoslavia by two French civil engineering companies, "Société de Construction des Batignolles" and "Société Edmond Bayer de Agner". Đujić wished to minimise the influence that the communist-dominated United Workers Syndicate Union of Yugoslavia held over the workforce in Dalmatia, and presented himself as a man out to defend the rights of workers throughout the country. The strike began on 15 May, on the Srb–Dugopolje road. After three days, it was broken up by the Yugoslav gendarmerie. Đujić then led the striking workers south to Vrpolje, where he attempted to negotiate a deal with the authorities. After negotiations broke down, Đujić led the workers north to Strmica, via Golubić and Pileći kuk. He held a large rally at Pileći kukwhich was attended by a crowd of over 800 peopleand delivered a speech criticising the regency for its "pro-[Roman] Catholic, anti-[Eastern] Orthodox and anti-worker" policies. An eyewitness reported that Đujić waved "a red [communist] flag and greeted followers with a clenched fist, all while being the leader of a Chetnik band." In Knin, Đujić and the striking workers clashed with police. The police fired on the protesters, wounding three and killing a young girl who was watching the clash. Đujić was subsequently arrested and spent ten days in prison for "insulting His Majesty" during the rally at Pileći kuk.
He later received financial compensation from the Yugoslav government for the "spiritual suffering and pain" caused by his brief period of detention. Đujić's actions greatly enhanced his reputation among Dalmatian peasants, who referred to him as a "brave leader of working men". The local authorities continued to view Đujić with suspicion, describing him as a "priest of left-wing democracy" in internal documents. Unsubstantiated rumours circulated that Đujić supported Ljotić's organisation, and that he was one of the few people that had voted for Ljotić in the 1938 Yugoslav parliamentary elections. The local authorities suspected that Đujić was an "old Italian spy" who received orders from the Italian intelligence headquarters in Zadar, but never uncovered any evidence to substantiate these suspicions. Before World War II, Đujić was a member of the exclusively-Serb Agrarian Union political party.
The historians Popović, Lolić and Latas observe that Đujić's espoused political views appear to be wildly inconsistent during the interwar period, but they ascribe this to his willingness to do anything to achieve power and wealth, including embracing the populism of opposing the Yugoslav state. Despite this apparent inconsistency, they also detect an underlying theme of Great Serb chauvinism in his actions throughout the period leading up to the war.
World War II.
Following the 1938 annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, Yugoslavia shared a border with the Third Reich and came under increasing pressure as her neighbours became aligned with the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with Italy when that country invaded and occupied neighbouring Albania. At the outbreak of World War II, the Yugoslav government declared its neutrality. Between September and November 1940, Hungary and Romania joined the Axis, and Italy invaded Greece from Albania. From that time, Yugoslavia was almost completely surrounded by Axis powers and their satellites, and her neutral stance toward the war came under tremendous pressure. In late February 1941, Bulgaria joined the Axis. The next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, almost closing the ring around Yugoslavia. With the aim of securing his southern flank before the pending attack on the Soviet Union, Adolf Hitler began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis powers. The Yugoslav government conditionally signed the Tripartite Pactthe instrument that constituted the Axisafter some delay, on 25 March 1941. Two days later, a group of pro-Western Serb-nationalist air force officers deposed Prince Paul in a bloodless coup d'état. The conspirators declared 17-year-old Prince Peter of age and brought to power a government of national unity led by General Dušan Simović. The coup enraged Hitler, who ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia which commenced on 6 April 1941.
Đujić did not support the coup. He realised that Yugoslavia's collapse was inevitable after seeing a column of demoralised troops from the barely mobilised 12th Infantry Division "Jadranska" pass his home. Once it became clear that the Royal Yugoslav Army (, VKJ) could not hold the Axis advance, Đujić started blaming Croat fifth column activity for the VKJ's military defeats. On 10 April 1941, the Ustaše-led Independent State of Croatia (, NDH) was proclaimed in Zagreb and divided into German and Italian zones of occupation. The Italians divided those parts of the NDH that they occupied into three zones: Zone I was those parts of Dalmatia that were annexed by Italy and formed the Governorate of Dalmatia; Zone II was an area which was demilitarised in respect of NDH forces, but was under NDH civil administration; and Zone III was the remainder up to the demarcation line with the Germans. This arrangement was implemented following the signing of the Treaties of Rome on 18 May. Following the signing, the Italians withdrew the bulk of their forces from Zones II and III, and those that remained there were formally considered to be allied forces stationed on NDH territory by mutual agreement. Strmica and Knin were included in the NDH and fell within Zone II.
Collaboration agreements with the Italians.
Đujić's emergence as a Chetnik leader in the region around Knin was rapid. Commencing in April 1941, the Ustaše implemented a policy of widespread incarcerations, massacres, forced emigration, and murder of Serbs within the territory they controlled. Around this time, Đujić's Chetniks began killing and mutilating Croat civilians. According to Italian reports, Đujić had around 300 Chetniks under his command in April, centered mainly around Knin. The first Ustaše atrocity in the Knin area occurred on 29 May, when a group of Serbs were killed. Around the same time, a group of Ustaše surrounded Strmica with the aim of capturing Đujić, but he was forewarned and escaped to Kistanje in Zone I where he sought Italian protection. Between late May and 27 July, the Ustaše killed more than 500 Serbs in the Knin district. On 13 July, the Ustaše ordered the arrest of all Serbian Orthodox priests in the district and the confiscation of their property, but Đujić was already beyond their reach. While the Italians generally stood by as the Ustaše committed atrocities, they did open up the border crossings into the Governorate of Dalmatia for Serbs fleeing the Ustaše. Refugees from Knin and nearby regions were taken into Italian-run camps located in Split, Obrovac, Benkovac, Kistanje and Šibenik. Đujić was a principal organiser within the Kistanje camp, which held around 1,500 refugees, and from mid-July was recruiting among them for the Chetnik cause.
Once a general uprising against the Ustaše had begun in August, Đujić went to the centre of the revolt in Drvar with another Chetnik leader and sought approval from the leadership of the uprising to take leadership of the rebellion in the Knin region. Đujić then established his Chetniks around Knin and coordinated with Chetniks in the Bosansko Grahovo district. Đujić's Chetniks successfully kept the Ustaše out of Knin and its surroundings, sparing the local Serb population from further massacres. As summer approached, Đujić's Chetniks captured Drvar from the Ustaše. By early summer, he and Chetnik commander Stevo Rađenović had contacted the Italians and asked them to put a halt to the Ustaše mistreatment of Serbs, enable the return of Serb refugees, and repeal a decree that enabled the confiscation of Serb-owned property in the NDH. The Italians obliged in the hope that doing so would win the Chetniks over to collaboration and seriously weaken any future uprising in the area, which would have further disrupted rail traffic along the Split–Karlovac railway line. On 13 August, at a meeting in the village of Pađene northwest of Knin, Đujić and several other Serb nationalists agreed to collaborate with the Italians. They secretly signed a pact of non-aggression with the Italian military, and in exchange, the Italians approved Đujić raising a force of up to 3,000 Chetniks. On 31 August, at a Drvar assembly, Đujić was given the task of stopping the Italian advance on the town. Immediately afterwards, he made an agreement with the Italians granting them free passage. Recruiting for Chetnik formations in the region was assisted by the so-called leftist errors of the Yugoslav Partisans, which drove undecided Serbs to join the Chetniks.
Dinara Division.
1942.
In early January 1942, the Dinara Division was formed after Đujić was contacted by Mihailović, via a courier. Under Mihailović's putative control, Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin played a central role in organising the units of Chetnik leaders in western Bosnia, Lika, and northern Dalmatia into the Dinara Division and dispatched former Royal Yugoslav Army officers to help. Đujić was designated the commander of the division with a goal of the "establishment of a Serb national state" in which "an exclusively Orthodox population is to live". At the time of its formation, the division was no more than 1,500 strong. The headquarters of the Dinara Division was located in Knin.
In mid-April, Đujić fomented a pro-Chetnik coup in a Partisan unit in the Gračac district northwest of Knin, which was part of a pattern of subversive Chetnik activity in the Knin region at the time. Around the same time Đujić's Chetniks were launching raids against villages held by the Partisans between Bosansko Grahovo and Drvar in conjunction with the Italians, who considered him a filibuster. He operated in northern Dalmatia under Trifunović-Birčanin who acted as liaison officer between the Chetniks and the Italians, and whose collaboration agreements were condoned by Mihailović. In June, Đujić was appointed as a Chetnik warlord (, војвода) by Mihailović. By the summer of 1942, Đujić's Chetniks had effectively become Italian auxiliaries, and they began providing Chetnik detachments with arms, ammunition and supplies. It is likely that the agreements between Đujić and the Italians were negotiated without Mihailović's prior knowledge. They were later denounced by Mihailović.
In mid-May, Đujić was a member of a Chetnik delegation that approached the Ustaše civil administration in the Knin region, and discussed joint action against the increasing threat from the Partisans. The Chetniks were given funds amounting to 100,000 kuna and arrangements were made for them to co-locate units with NDH forces and to receive food from the Ustaše authorities. On 28 June, as a gathering in the village of Kosovo near Knin, Đujić urged his Chetniks to be loyal to the NDH. In this way, Đujić and other Chetnik leaders established co-operation with the Ustaše, although according to the political scientist Sabrina P. Ramet, these relationships were "based only on their common fear of the Partisans" and "characterised by distrust and uncertainty". Đujić actively co-operated with Italian forces, with whom he had concluded a non-aggression pact. On 1 October, Italian units, accompanied by units of the Dinara Division under the command of Đujić, Mane Rokvić and Veljko Ilijić conducted an operation in and around the village of Gata near Split. During the operation, the Chetniks killed 95–96 Croats, mostly women, children and the elderly, then burned most of the village. According to the journalist Tim Judah, about 200 Croats were killed, and the actions of the Chetniks at Gata outraged the Italians. In the same month Đujić told his men "we Chetniks have to be in good relations with the Croats for the time being in order to get a large number of arms and munitions, but when the time comes we will settle accounts with them". At the same time, while Đujić and fellow Chetnik leader Uroš Drenović were hoping to join forces in western Bosnia, the Partisans were in the ascendancy. In November, arrangements were made with the Italians for 3,000 Herzegovinian Chetniks to be transferred to the Knin region and Lika to prevent the destruction of the Dinara Division by the Partisans. This transfer was effected in mid-December.
1943.
In early February 1943, Đujić and fellow Chetnik leader Petar Baćović tried to participate in the Axis Case White offensive against the Partisans but the Germans stopped them from getting involved. On 10 February, Đujić, Ilija Mihić, Baćović and Radovan Ivanišević, the Chetnik commanders of east Bosnia, Herzegovina, Dalmatia, and Lika, signed a joint proclamation declaring to the "people of Bosnia, Lika, and Dalmatia" that "since we have cleansed Serbia, Montenegro, and Herzegovina, we have come to help to crush the pitiful remnants of the Communist international, criminal band of Tito, Moša Pijade, Levi Vajnert and other paid Jews". The Partisan rank and file was called upon to "kill the political commissars and join our ranks right away," like the "hundreds and hundreds who are surrendering every day, conscious that they have been betrayed and swindled by the Communist Jews." By 17 February, it was clear that the Chetniks in western Bosnia, including Đujić's Dinara Division, had failed to use Case White to recapture Drvar and unite the Chetnik forces in the Dinaric Alps and western Bosnia.
Following the death of Trifunović-Birčanin in February 1943, Đujić, along with Dobroslav Jevđević, Baćović, and Ivanišević vowed to the Italians to carry on Trifunović-Birčanin's policies of closely collaborating with them against the Partisans. By March, detachments of the Dinara Division were refusing to budge from the localities in which they had been recruited, would not carry out mobile operations, and according to the Italians, "were good for little else but plunder". By April, difficulties had arisen between Mihailović's delegates and civilian Chetnik leaders like Đujić, to the extent that Mihailović's delegate told Đujić to avoid interaction with the Italians unless Mihailović had given prior approval. Despite these orders, Mihailović's delegates never achieved control of all of the civilian Chetnik leaders like Đujić.
In late May, Đujić and the other long-term civilian collaborationist Chetnik leaders in the region suffered a severe setback when the Italian leader, Benito Mussolini, acquiesced to German demands and ordered the commander of the Italian Second Army, "Generale di Corpo d'Armata" (Lieutenant General) Mario Robotti, to coordinate with the Germans in the disarming of Chetnik detachments. Đujić prevailed upon Robotti to intercede with the Germans, and in June was granted a reprieve when the German Commander-in-Chief South-East Europe, "Generaloberst" Alexander Löhr, agreed that Đujić's Chetniks could be disarmed gradually, or in a few months time. At the same time as this was agreed, the Italian XVIII Army Corps were ordered to progressively reduce the supplies of food provided to the Dinara Division.
Throughout the summer, Đujić's Chetniks fought the Partisans in western Bosnia, but by early August they had suffered severe reverses at the hands of the Partisans around Bosansko Grahovo and had to withdraw from that area. Around the same time, one of Mihailović's delegates, Mladen Žujović, reported that the Dinara Division was "poorly formed, badly armed and disciplined", did not have "accurate registers of officers and troops", and could muster no more than 3,000 men. Žujović concluded his report by stating that the division was a "figment of the imagination". Mihailović's delegate in western Bosnia, Đuro Plećaš, was killed in August after he clashed with Đujić. Around the middle of the month, Đujić and other Chetnik leaders approached the Italians and admitted that Mihailović had directed them to disarm Italian units in case of an Italian capitulation to the Allies. They promised that they would not carry out these orders. By late August, German pressure, reduced Italian supplies and the fighting against the Partisans was resulting in increased defections to the Partisans and was also undermining Đujić's position as leader. Around the same time, Đujić narrowly escaped arrest by the Italians, and thanks to an intervention by Robotti, also avoided arrest by the Germans.
Despite these difficulties, Đujić's detachments in Dalmatia and western Bosnia were used by the Italians almost up to the point of their surrender. Just before the Italian surrender, in an attempt to shore up Italian support, Đujić travelled to XVIII Army Corps headquarters in Knin to assure the Italians of his "sincere friendship and cooperation with the Italian people", but at this point the Italians were incapable of developing a coherent policy towards the Chetniks. By this time, Đujić's detachments had rapidly declined in military value and were of little use for offensive operations.
Following the Italian capitulation on 8 September, the Germans moved quickly to secure the Adriatic coastline ahead of a feared Allied landing, and Đujić's detachments tried unsuccessfully to slow their deployment through sabotage. Late that month, Đujić fled to avoid arrest by the Germans. In western Bosnia, many members of the Dinara Division had already transferred their allegiance to the Partisans or deserted. The remainder began collaborating with the Germans as early as October, although they did not number more than a few thousand. In mid-October, Đujić managed to persuade the Germans to withdraw their arrest order. Nevertheless, the Germans were less supportive of his Chetniks than the Italians had been, did not trust them in large-scale actions, and restricted their activities to guarding railway tracks between Knin and the Adriatic coast from Partisan sabotage.
The Germans required all members of the Dinara Division to produce their German-issued identification passes to receive arms and munitions, and eschewed a written agreement with Đujić. His new situation was in stark contrast to the advantageous position he had enjoyed when dealing with the Italians, and the activities of the Dinara Division were strictly controlled, including a prohibition against undertaking operations in areas populated by Croats. The Germans had intercepted his radio communications with Mihailović in September, which meant that his reported strength and intentions were known to the Germans, and further undermined his attempts to gain greater freedom of action. On 19 or 20 November 1943, Mihailović ordered Đujić to collaborate with the Germans, adding that he himself was unable to openly do so "because of public opinion." By the end of December, Đujić began to develop links with Ljotić's Yugoslav National Movement in German-occupied Serbia. Đujić also began to actively circumvent Mihailović's influence by sending him false information.
Retreat and surrender.
In February 1944, Đujić ordered his commanders to infiltrate the Partisans with the aim of engaging in sabotage and assassination. Đujić said of the Dinara Division that it was:
On 25 November 1944, the Yugoslav Partisans attacked the town of Knin, which was defended by 14,000 German troops, 4,500 of Đujić's Chetniks, and around 1,500 Ustaše. On 1 December, Đujić was wounded and sent an emissary to General Gustav Fehn of the German 264th Infantry Division in Knin with the following message: 
On 3 December 1944, Đujić's force of between 6,000 and 7,000 withdrew to Bihać with help from the Wehrmacht 373rd Infantry Division. The Chetniks received ammunition and food from the Germans and began a joint German-Chetnik offensive against the Partisans. Fehn organised the transportation of Đujić's wounded Chetniks through Zagreb to the Third Reich. Đujić requested a written guarantee from Ante Pavelić, leader of the NDH, to afford him and his forces refuge in German-occupied Slovenia. Ljotić and Nedić also petitioned to Nazi party official Hermann Neubacher in Vienna that Đujić's forces should be allowed passage, as did Slovene collaborationist General Leon Rupnik.
On 21 December 1944, Pavelić ordered the military forces of the NDH to give Đujić and his forces "orderly and unimpeded passage". Đujić and his 6,000-odd typhus-ridden Chetniks took an alternate route towards the Istrian peninsula, as the routes offered by Pavelić were not secure from Partisan attacks. Along the way, hundreds were lost to Ustaše attacks. When Đujić and his troops reached Slovenia in late December, his forces joined Jevđević's Chetniks, Ljotić's Serbian Volunteer Corps, and Nedić's Serbian Shock Corps, forming a single unit that was under the command of Odilo Globocnik, the Higher SS and Police Leader in the Adriatic Littoral. In January Đujić's men were disarmed by the Germans. Together, the collaborationist forces tried to contact the western Allies in Italy in an attempt to secure foreign aid for a proposed anti-Communist offensive to restore royalist Yugoslavia. Mihailović did not oppose this plan openly and even sent warm letters to Đujić during this period. In May 1945, Đujić surrendered his troops to Allied forces and they were then taken to southern Italy, from there to displaced persons camps in Germany and then dispersed.
Life in exile.
In 1947, Đujić was tried and convicted of war crimes "in absentia" by Yugoslavia's communist government. He was found guilty of mass murder, torture, rape, robbery, and forcible confinement, as well as collaborating with the German and Italians. He was accused of being responsible for the deaths of 1,500 people over the course of the war. Between 1947 and 1949, Đujić lived in Paris, before emigrating to the United States. Many of his former Chetniks followed him. Following his arrival in the United States, Đujić and his fighters played a role in the foundation of the Ravna Gora Movement of Serbian Chetniks. He was very active among the Serbian diaspora and the Serbian Orthodox Church in North America. In the 1960s, he enraged some in the diaspora by supporting German, the Tito-approved Serbian patriarch, against the anti-communist American bishop Dionisije Milivojević. Nevertheless, he remained strongly opposed to Yugoslavia's communist government. Đujić retired to San Marcos, California. In 1988, the Yugoslav authorities unsuccessfully sought Đujić's extradition from the United States. By this time, Đujić was the oldest surviving leader of the wartime Chetniks.
On 28 June 1989, the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo, Đujić granted the title of "vojvoda" to Vojislav Šešelj. He further ordered him "to expel all Croats, Albanians, and other foreign elements from holy Serbian soil", stating he would return only when Serbia was cleansed of "the last Jew, Albanian, and Croat". Šešelj was at the time an anti-communist dissident. The writer and political analyst Paul Hockenos subsequently described Šešelj's activities in the Yugoslav Wars as those of "a man whose killer commando units operating in Croatia and Bosnia carried on the very worst of the Chetnik tradition." Šešelj later became the leader of the Serbian Radical Party, a government coalition partner of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. In 1993, Đujić remarked: "[I condemn] Vojislav Šešelj who, by openly siding with the Socialist Party of Serbia, who are Communists who have only changed their name, has sullied the name of Chetnikdom and Serbian nationalism." In 1998, Đujić publicly stated that he regretted awarding the title to Šešelj. "I was naïve when I nominated Šešelj [as] "vojvoda"; I ask my people to forgive me," Đujić remarked. "The greatest gravedigger of Serbdom is Slobodan Milošević." Đujić considered Milošević the successor to Tito, and that he had compromised Serbian national rights within Yugoslavia.
According to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) testimony of Croatian Serb leader Milan Babić, Đujić financially supported the Republic of Serbian Krajina in the 1990s with a donation of . Đujić's wife died in 1995. In 1998, Biljana Plavšić, then President of Republika Srpska, presented an honorary award to Đujić. Plavšić was later indicted by the ICTY and convicted of crimes against humanity.
Death and legacy.
Đujić died on 11 September 1999 at a hospice in San Diego, California at the age of 92. A "New York Times" obituary by the journalist David Binder stated that Đujić participated in "epic World War II battles" and carried out many "acts of wartime bravery." Editorial writer for "The Washington Post", Benjamin Wittes, observed that the obituary only mentioned "in passing" the war crimes and collaboration accusations against Đujić, as well as his influence in the Yugoslav Wars. He concludes that Đujić "was no anti-fascist hero," and that he was an example of the dangers inherent in ultranationalism. The historian Marko Attila Hoare stated that Binder was known for his "admiration of Serb Nazi-collaborator Momčilo Đujić."
A commemoration marking six months since Đujić's death, organised by the "Vojvoda" Momčilo Đujić Dinara Chetnik Movement, was celebrated at St. Mark's Church in Belgrade in March 2000, and his death was commemorated again at the same church in 2012. The latter service was attended by Mladen Obradović, the leader of the far-right Serbian ultra-nationalist political party, Obraz. The Serbian diaspora in the United States set up a monument dedicated to Đujić at the Serbian cemetery in Libertyville, Illinois. The management and players of the football club Red Star Belgrade visited the monument on 23 May 2010. Darko Miličića former Serbian national basketball player who played in the NBA for ten yearshas a tattoo of Đujić on his body.
Commemorations of the Gata massacre committed by Đujić's Chetniks on 1 October 1942 have been conducted in the recent past, including on the 75th anniversary in 2017, at which Blaženko Boban, a prefect of Split-Dalmatia County, represented the president of Croatia, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. A survivor of the massacre, Andrija Pivčević, who was eight years old at the time and was stabbed nine times by Chetniks, placed a wreath and a candle during the 2017 commemorative service. Pivčević testified about the massacre at Mihailović's trial in 1946. Several of those who spoke at the service decried the rehabilitation of Chetnik collaborators and war criminals in Serbia. 
In 2021, Prvomajska (1st of May) Street, a busy thoroughfare in the Belgrade district of Zemun was renamed Father Momčilo Đujić Street. This action was condemned by Tomislav Žigmanov, the leader of the Democratic Alliance of Croats in Vojvodinaa political party in Serbia, and by the Serbian journalist Tomislav Marković in an opinion piece for Al Jazeera Balkans. Both decried the move as a continuation of the official rehabilitation of Serb World War II collaborators by Serbian authorities since 2004 via historical revisionism and falsification of history, which has even spread into school textbooks.

Roadheader

A roadheader, also called a boom-type roadheader, road header machine, road header or just header machine, is a piece of excavating equipment consisting of a boom-mounted cutting head, a loading device usually involving a conveyor, and a crawler travelling track to move the entire machine forward into the rock face.
The cutting head can be a general purpose rotating drum mounted in line or perpendicular to the boom, or can be special function heads such as jackhammer-like spikes, compression fracture micro-wheel heads like those on larger tunnel boring machines, a slicer head like a gigantic chain saw for dicing up rock, or simple jaw-like buckets of traditional excavators.
History.
The first roadheader patent was applied for by Dr. Z. Ajtay in Hungary, in 1949. It was invented as a remote operated miner for exploitation of small seam, close walled deposits, typically in wet conditions.
Types.
Cutting Heads:
Uses.
Roadheaders were initially used in coal mines. The first use in a civil engineering project was the construction of the City Loop (then called the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop) in the 1970s, where the machines enabled around 80% of the excavation to be performed mechanically.
They are now widely used in such as tunneling both for mining and municipal government projects, building wine caves, and building cave homes such as those in Coober Pedy, Australia.
On February 21, 2014, Waller Street, just south of Laurier Avenue collapsed into an 8m-wide and 12m-deep sink-hole where a roadheader was excavating the eastern entrance to Ottawa's LRT O-Train tunnel. A similar incident occurred in June 2016, when a sink-hole opened up in Rideau Street during further construction of the tunnel, and filled with water up to a depth of three metres. The CBC reported that one of Rideau Transit Group’s 135-tonne roadheaders was in a part of the tunnel where the flooding was the deepest. Three roadheaders were used in the construction of the O-Train.

The Rock Machine Turns You On

The Rock Machine Turns You On was the first bargain priced sampler album. It was released in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, The Netherlands, Germany and a number of other European countries in 1968 as part of an international marketing campaign by CBS, the Columbia label then active in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
A 1969 edition (Number ASF 1356) bought in South Africa has a different sleeve (yellow with cut-outs in the Rock Machine boxes) and psychedelic multicoloured vinyl. It also has a completely different track list, significant tracks being Big Brother and the Holding Company's "Piece of my Heart" and Leonard Cohen's "Suzanne".
Marketing campaign.
The "Rock Machine" marketing campaign was initiated in the US in January 1968, by CBS's American parent, Columbia Records, under its president Clive Davis. The campaign was intended as a promotion for its expanding roster of rock and folk rock acts, who included Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Simon and Garfunkel, Leonard Cohen, Moby Grape, Spirit, Taj Mahal, and Blood, Sweat and Tears. Early promotional material in "Billboard" magazine stated:""The Rock Machine"...it's the happening sounds of today. Out of it comes the biggest, hottest rock list that ever started off any month. And with our Columbia Rock Machine, the most exciting and meaningful merchandising campaign we've ever devised... It's all here - the talent, the product and the big concept to make it all happen. Now, doesn't that turn you on?"
The design of the "Rock Machine" logo, used in subsequent publicity material, including album covers, was by Milton Glaser.
Sampler album.
As part of its highly successful campaign, CBS Records released "The Rock Machine Turns You On", the first budget sampler LP, in the UK in 1968. The album was priced at 14 shillings and 11 pence (£0.75), less than half the cost of a full priced LP at the time. It entered the UK Albums Chart in June 1969, several months after its first release, rising to no. 18, and was estimated to have sold over 140,000 copies.
"The Rock Machine Turns You On" influenced a generation of music fans. At the time, what was then called "underground music" was starting to achieve some commercial success in Europe, bolstered by new radio and TV programmes such as John Peel's "Top Gear". CBS competed actively for this new market against other “progressive” labels such as Elektra, Island, Immediate, and the EMI subsidiary Harvest, who followed with similar samplers of their acts. Although some of the featured artists were already stars, others such as Leonard Cohen, Taj Mahal and Spirit were only starting to become known in Europe, and the album made a major contribution to their success.
Follow-ups.
CBS released a second, similar, sampler album in the UK in 1968, "Rock Machine I Love You". The company followed up these LPs in 1970 with three double sampler albums - "Fill Your Head with Rock", "Rockbuster", and "Together!".
Some years later, the affiliated company, Epic Records, used a similar format for "The Rock Machine Still Turns You On", Vols. 1 and 2, in 1983.
A version of "The Rock Machine Turns You On" was issued on CD by Sony Records in 1996, but it lacked the Simon and Garfunkel track for licensing reasons.

Tommy Carcetti

Thomas J. "Tommy" Carcetti ( ) is a fictional character on the HBO drama "The Wire", played by Aidan Gillen. Carcetti is an ambitious and venal Baltimore politician who begins the series with a seat on the city council.
Biography.
Season 3.
Tommy Carcetti first appears as a member of the Baltimore City Council. Although he is depicted as a loving father, he is regularly unfaithful to his wife Jen. He also works closely with Tony Gray, a fellow councilman. Carcetti is idealistic and ambitious, and has the backing of local Democrats in Baltimore's 1st district as well as Major Stan Valchek of the Baltimore Police Department. To improve upon the crime and urban decay plaguing Baltimore, Carcetti considers running for mayor against the African-American incumbent, Clarence Royce, despite the prospect of being a white candidate in a predominantly black city.
Using his connection to Valchek, Carcetti successfully manipulates Acting Commissioner Ervin Burrell into working with him, promising resources and political capital in exchange for inside information about Royce's decision-making. Carcetti becomes increasingly disillusioned with Royce and decides to run against him, recruiting college friend and Washington political consultant Theresa D'Agostino as his campaign manager.
With Carcetti's encouragement, Gray starts his own campaign for mayor. Realizing that Gray's campaign would split the black voter base in the election, D'Agostino advises Carcetti that enhancing Gray's chances of success would in turn improve his own. Carcetti dislikes the idea of abusing his friend's trust, but follows D'Agostino's strategy nonetheless.
After the BPD learns about "Hamsterdam" — Major Howard "Bunny" Colvin's drug-tolerant zones in West Baltimore — Royce refuses to allow the department to immediately shut them down. Burrell, believing the mayor is making a ploy against the police, leaks the information to Carcetti. At D'Agostino's suggestion, Carcetti tours the area with Colvin, seeing that Hamsterdam has had the positive impact of isolating the drug trade from the rest of Colvin's district.
At a city council meeting, Carcetti implicitly blames Royce for the debacle in an impassioned speech. Through this, Gray realizes that Carcetti is running for mayor without his knowledge or input. After Carcetti publicly launches his campaign, Gray ends both their alliance and their friendship. Carcetti's speech relies heavily on "war" rhetoric, which clashes with Colvin's view that such perspectives have made the War on Drugs unwinnable.
Season 4.
Carcetti continues his campaign, with D'Agostino serving as his strategist while Norman Wilson, a former editor at "The Baltimore Sun", becomes his campaign manager. When early polls show low numbers for Carcetti, he assumes that he has already lost on the basis of his race and begins to lose interest in the campaign. He chooses not to prepare for an upcoming debate with Royce and Gray, believing that he could win the debate but still lose the election regardless.
However, Carcetti's debate performance is invigorated when he learns from Valchek that a state's witness was recently murdered. He uses this inside information and his previous request for a witness protection scheme to ambush Royce to great effect. Carcetti persuades Gray to publicly criticize Royce with the promise of a prominent council position in exchange for taking a large share of the African-American vote.
His confidence restored, Carcetti hits the campaign trail with renewed vigor, receiving assistance from State Delegate Odell Watkins, who has turned against Royce. Thanks to his alliance with Watkins, Carcetti defeats Royce in a close Democratic primary election. In a city with a 9 to 1 Democratic advantage, Carcetti easily defeats a Republican named Crawford in the general election with 81% of the vote.
As mayor-elect, Carcetti immediately makes changes before his inauguration. After discussions with city officials, he decides to replace Burrell as BPD commissioner, planning to attract outside candidates while asking Burrell to resign. Burrell quickly realizes what is happening and rallies support from City Council President Nerese Campbell, corrupt State Senator Clay Davis, and a group of influential black ministers. Burrell orders an increase in arrests at Davis' suggestion, hoping to prove that the BPD is functioning well under his leadership. A frustrated Carcetti restricts Burrell's authority and insists that he clear his orders through Deputy Commissioner William Rawls.
Major Cedric Daniels, a politically neutral African-American district commander, impresses Carcetti with his interest in securing quality felony arrests instead of statistically based reductions in crime. Carcetti offers Daniels a promotion to the Criminal Investigations Division and an automatic promotion to the rank of colonel. Through Daniels, Carcetti learns of Burrell's arrest hike and consequently orders the BPD to reform its approach by prioritizing quality felony cases over statistical quotas.
Carcetti's plans for the BPD are derailed when he learns that Baltimore's schools face a $54 million budget deficit. He and Wilson travel to Annapolis in order to convince the governor to bail out the schools. The governor agrees on the condition that Carcetti face public humiliation by publicly admitting to eliciting his aid. Carcetti rejects the offer, as it would be damaging to his own planned campaign for governor; Wilson is left disappointed at Carcetti's decision to put his ambition ahead of the needs of the city. Carcetti justifies his decision by saying that he would be in a better place to help the city schools as governor.
Carcetti deals with a brutality complaint against BPD sergeant Thomas "Herc" Hauk. At Wilson and Rawls' suggestion, Carcetti decides to defer to Daniels, Herc's former commanding officer, who decides that a reprimand for excessive force is sufficient punishment. Burrell approaches Carcetti to suggest that a more rigorous review of Herc is needed. Herc is forced to leave the BPD as an eventual result. Burrell is finally able to prove his usefulness to Carcetti by exploiting his political intellect, but Carcetti continues to consult Daniels on policing strategy.
Season 5.
Carcetti's decision to reject the governor's bailout leaves him with intractable budget problems. He is forced to cut spending in other areas in order to plug the schools' budget deficit and is unable to keep his promises to reform the BPD. Despite the problems facing the city, Carcetti remains focused on running for governor two years into his term. Carcetti meets with Burrell and Rawls to discuss the BPD's problems, becoming concerned with crime statistics despite his prior decision to discourage stat-based policing. Morale in the BPD is at a low because Carcetti is withholding payment of overtime. The commissioners convince him to lift a cap on secondary employment for officers in order to improve their morale.
Carcetti's new chief of staff, Michael Steintorf, replaces Wilson as his primary advisor. The mayor faces criticism from Wilson but still seeks his counsel. Meanwhile, he meets with the U.S. Attorney to discuss federal assistance in the vacant murders case. The U.S. Attorney, a Republican, desires federal handling of a corruption investigation against Davis. Carcetti refuses because he is worried it will be used to discredit Baltimore's Democratic Party.
Carcetti, intent on running for governor, alienates Watkins with his lack of attention to the city. Carcetti considers the prospect of being replaced by Campbell, who has become tainted by a corruption scandal. Elsewhere, Rawls leaks BPD statistics to Carcetti showing a rising crime rate. When Burrell delivers manipulated statistics to Carcetti, the mayor finally has the political ammunition needed to have him fired. Carcetti plans to replace Burrell with Daniels, but is worried that he will not be accepted by Campbell and the ministers. He plans to temporarily promote Rawls to acting commissioner while Daniels prepares for the role as Deputy Commissioner of Operations. Carcetti leaks news of the plan to the press via Wilson to test the waters.
Carcetti offers favors to Campbell and the ministers to accept his plans for the BPD. Carcetti grants Campbell permission for the demolition of the McCullough homes, a housing project that is adjacent to Andy Krawczyk's latest building development. Campbell convinces Burrell to leave office quietly by promising him a lucrative replacement position. Carcetti reluctantly accepts the deal when Campbell hints that Burrell has knowledge of corrupt activity in Daniels' past, but Carcetti remains unaware of the specifics. Carcetti officially announces his plans for the BPD at a press conference.
In the end of series montage, it is shown that Carcetti's political machinations have succeeded and he has been elected governor of Maryland. Campbell, as the city council president, succeeds him as mayor for the remainder of his term. Rawls and Valchek are promoted to superintendent of the Maryland State Police and commissioner of the BPD, respectively.
Critical response.
"Entertainment Weekly" named Carcetti one of the five most interesting characters in season four.
Character inspiration.
A fictionalized version of the events of the 1999 Baltimore mayoral election were presented in the third and fourth seasons of "The Wire", which aired in 2004 and 2006, respectively. Many saw the connection between Carcetti and Martin O'Malley, an Irish-American Baltimore City Councillor who was elected mayor, defeating two African American opponents. Carlos Watson of MSNBC once introduced O'Malley as "one of the real-life inspirations for the mayor of the hit TV show "The Wire"", to which O'Malley responded that he was instead the show's "antidote".
Show creator David Simon denied that the character of Tommy Carcetti was supposed to be O'Malley. Simon did acknowledge that O'Malley was "one of several inspirations" for Carcetti. He further stated that while Carcetti was "reflective" of O'Malley, Carcetti was a composite drawing aspects from other local politicians that he had covered when he worked as a reporter for "The Baltimore Sun". In 2018, show writer William F. Zorzi said that Carcetti was "based in part on O'Malley" and "a number" of other politicians.

Iowa in the American Civil War

 
The state of Iowa played a significant role during the American Civil War in providing food, supplies, troops and officers for the Union army.
Prelude to war.
Iowa had become the 29th state in the Union on December 28, 1846. Settlers had defeated the Sauk, Meskwaki, and Ho-Chunk during the 1832 Black Hawk War, resulting in lopsided treaties ceding land to the settlers. Future treaties forced out these and Dakota peoples and opened nearly all land to settlers. As a territory, Iowa had a small number of enslaved people (16 counted in the 1840 census). When Iowa earned statehood, its new constitution outlawed slavery.
Many native-born settlers in Iowa were Yankee, who had moved West from New England and upstate New York across what is now the upper Midwest. From the Northeast, these settlers brought family-based smallholder farms rather than the large plantation systems of the Southern United States. By the time of war, only the extreme northwestern part of the state remained an unsettled frontier area. Prominent foreign-born places of origin included Germany and Ireland, and many of these immigrants established farms similar to those of the Yankees. Many of the settlers in Iowa were also of Mid-Atlantic (Pennsylvanian) stock. Some Upland Southern/Appalachian settlers from Virginia and Kentucky arrived and settled in Southern Iowa.
Most of the settlers in Iowa were located along Eastern rivers, especially the Mississippi, at the outbreak of war. Davenport was a prominent river port, and Muscatine had a large concentration of free blacks, either escaped fugitives or from Northeastern free states. Steamboat trade connected the state to other Mississippi river ports, including those in slave states. With the development in the 1850s of the Illinois Central and the Chicago and North Western Railway, Iowa's fertile fields were linked with Eastern supply depots. Agricultural producers and manufacturers in the state could readily get their products to the Union army by river or rail during the War.
Some settlers continued West into the Plains. One such settler was abolitionist John Brown, who used Iowa as a base for his operations in Kansas.
Civil War.
Politics.
The Civil War era brought considerable change to Iowa's politics. During the 1850s, the state's dominant Democratic Party developed serious internal problems, as well as being unsuccessful in getting the national Democratic Party to respond to their local needs.
Iowans soon formed the newly emerging Republican Party. The new party opposed the expansion of slavery and favored opening newly conquered Western lands to free farmers, rather than slave-based plantations. The new party promoted homesteading, banking, railroads, and the creation of public agricultural colleges. Iowa had a strong anti-slavery presence that included some Protestant religious denominations (such as the Quakers and the evangelical denominations affected by the Second Great Awakening), German immigrants, and a free black community.
The Republican Party's "free soil, free labor, free men" platform favored small-scale farmers that made up Iowa and much of the present-day Midwest. Iowa voted for John C. Fremont, the first Republican presidential candidate, in 1856. In 1860 and 1864, it voted heavily for Abraham Lincoln and other Republican politicians. There was a strong antiwar "Copperhead" movement among settlers of Southern origins. Some pacifist religious groups, such as the Mennonites, favored the Democrats and their anti-war position and opposed mandatory military service. The Democratic party remained particularly in places around the Mississippi River such as Dubuque that had been heavily settled by German and Irish immigrants. While many Germans strongly opposed slavery, the Republican party had nativist elements, especially against Catholics.
The governorship.
In 1859, Samuel J. Kirkwood was nominated for governor and defeated Democrat Augustus C. Dodge after a bitter campaign which focused on the slave issue. In 1860, Kirkwood's first year in office, the John Brown raid on Harpers Ferry further polarized the nation over slavery, and Kirkwood was clearly on the side of the abolitionists. When Barclay Coppock, a youth from Springdale, who was part of Brown's raid, fled to Iowa, Kirkwood refused to accept extradition papers for him from Virginia, and allowed Coppock to escape.
During the Civil War, Kirkwood gained national attention for his extraordinary efforts to secure soldiers and supplies from Iowa for the Union Army. A strong supporter of President Abraham Lincoln's policies during the American Civil War, he was active in raising and equipping dozens of regiments for the Union Army. In 1862, he attended the Loyal War Governors' Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, which ultimately gave Lincoln support for his Emancipation Proclamation.
Military recruitment.
As the Civil War erupted, Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood led efforts to raise and equip volunteer troops for the Federal service. The 1st Iowa Infantry was raised for three-months duty from May until August 1861. It helped secure the strategic Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad in northern Missouri, then endured a series of forced marches across the state, finally fighting with distinction in the Battle of Wilson's Creek, a task rewarded by the official Thanks of Congress, and two Iowans would later be awarded the Medal of Honor for their efforts in the fighting.
Iowa contributed 48 regiments of state infantry, 1 regiment of black infantry, 9 regiments of cavalry, and 4 artillery batteries. In addition to these Federally mustered troops, the state also raised a number of home guard or militia units, including the Northern Border Brigade and Southern Border Brigade, primarily for defense of the borders, but with a commission from governor Kirkwood authorizing the border brigades to cross into Missouri (or into Minnesota and Dakota Territory) to pursue Confederate or Indian raiders. Alexander Clark, prominent African American citizen of Muscatine, recruited the "60th Iowa Colored Troops, originally known as the 1st Iowa Infantry, African Descent." Despite being a small minority in the state, by war's end, a total of nearly 1,100 blacks from Iowa and Missouri served in the regiment.
Military action.
There were no significant battles in Iowa, but the state sent large supplies of food to the armies and the eastern cities. Sporadically, Confederate partisans and bushwhackers raided Iowa. One such incursion in the fall of 1864 was designed to disrupt the reelection of Abraham Lincoln. Near the Missouri border, some Iowans were Copperhead anti-Lincoln sympathizers, and they provided a safe haven for guerrillas. On October 12, 1864, a dozen raiders disguised as Union soldiers terrorized Davis County, where they looted residences and kidnapped and murdered three Iowans near Bloomfield.
76,242 Iowa men (out of a total population of 674,913 in 1860) served in the military, many in combat units attached to the western armies. 13,001 died of wounds or disease (two-thirds of whom were of the latter). 8,500 Iowa men were wounded. Cemeteries throughout the South contain the remains of Iowa soldiers who fell during the war, with the largest concentration at Vicksburg National Cemetery. A number also died in Confederate prison camps, including Andersonville prison. Though the total number of Iowans who served in the military during the Civil War seems small compared to the more heavily populated eastern and southern states, no other state, north or south, had a higher percentage of its male population between the ages of 15 and 40 serve in the military during the course of the war.
Actions against Native Americans.
Both the Ho Chunk (Winnebagos) and the Santee band of the Sioux nation posed the biggest threat to Iowa's northwestern border. Other local units included the Sioux City Cavalry—a militia company which, however, was subsequently mustered into US service and deployed to Dakota Territory after the Santee Sioux Uprising of 1862 and became General Alfred Sully's Headquarters Guard during the Union Army's subsequent "Punitive Expeditions" against 700 renegade Santee Sioux in 1863 and 1864. Sully selected the Sioux City Cavalry as his escort and guard over several other cavalry units because of the previous experience of its members who had worked for years before the war as trappers, traders and teamsters along the Military Road running from the US Army logistics depot at Sioux City northwest to the Dakota Territorial capital at Yankton and onward to Fort Randall which, at that time, was the largest US Army post on the upper Missouri river. As such these militia troopers were thoroughly experienced with other Sioux bands—such as the Yankton and Yankonais—and knew their sign, their language, and their customs. Likewise, the 6th Iowa Cavalry and one battalion of the 14th Iowa Infantry were deployed to Forts Randall, Pierre and Berthold, Dakota Territory as part of the same campaigns against the Santee renegades.
Iowans in the Confederacy.
A minority of Iowans sympathized with the Confederacy and some Iowans served in the Confederate Army. The number, 76 identified individuals, including at least four men who were sons of Iowan politicians and James Harrison Williams, an Iowa state representative before he "went South".
Postbellum memorialization.
The Keokuk National Cemetery was established as a final resting place for bodies from five local U.S. Army hospitals in Keokuk. It holds over 600 Union soldiers, and 8 Confederate prisoners of war.
Following the war, a number of veterans organizations, and in particular the Grand Army of the Republic, played a prominent role in providing social functions, financial support, and memorialization of the former soldiers. The G.A.R. provided the funds and impetus for the construction of the Iowa Soldiers' Home in Marshalltown and other similar homes and hospitals, as well as orphanages.

Virginia State Route 24

State Route 24 (SR 24) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs from U.S. Route 221 (US 221) and SR 116 in Roanoke east to US 60 in Mt. Rush. SR 24 connects Roanoke with several small communities in southern Bedford County and central Campbell County. The state highway also runs concurrently with US 460 west of Appomattox and passes through Appomattox Court House National Historical Park, which is the site of Robert E. Lee's final stand and surrender in the American Civil War.
Route description.
SR 24 begins at an intersection with US 221 and SR 116 at the southern edge of downtown Roanoke. SR 116 runs north–south along Jefferson Street; US 221 joins SR 116 north on Jefferson Street and heads west on two-lane undivided Elm Avenue. SR 24 heads east along Elm Avenue, which becomes a four-lane divided boulevard at SR 24's terminus. The state highway intersects Williamson Road and crosses over a rail line before reaching the diamond interchange at the southern terminus of Interstate 581 (I-581). US 220 runs concurrently with I-581 north to I-81 and south solo as the Roy Webber Expressway toward Rocky Mount. East of I-581 and US 220, SR 24 splits into a one-way pair that follows Bullitt Avenue eastbound and Jamison Avenue westbound. The two directions come together at 13th Street to form four-lane divided Dale Avenue, along which the state highway crosses over a rail line and Tinker Creek to leave the city of Roanoke.
SR 24 continues through the town of Vinton in Roanoke County as Virginia Avenue, which bypasses the center of town to the south. At Chestnut Street, the four-lane divided boulevard transitions onto Hardy Road; when Hardy Road continues east, SR 24 curves north as Bypass Road, which ends at Washington Avenue, the main street of Vinton. The state highway heads east along Washington Avenue to the town limit of Vinton at Wolf Creek. SR 24 has an interchange with the Blue Ridge Parkway at a low gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains between Stewart Knob and Chestnut Mountain immediately before the highway enters Bedford County, where its name changes to Stewartsville Road. The state highway remains a four-lane divided highway to just east of Stewartsville. SR 24 continues east as a two-lane undivided road through the southern Bedford County community of Chamblissburg and Meads Store.
SR 24 crosses Goose Creek shortly before intersecting SR 122 (Moneta Road) west of the hamlet of Body Camp. The state highway continues east as Shingle Block Road to its western intersection with SR 43 (Virginia Byway). SR 24 and SR 43 continue east along Glenwood Drive to their split at Gillespie, where SR 43 heads south as Leesville Road. SR 24 continues northeast as Wyatts Way, which enters Campbell County in the middle of its curvaceous course between its crossing of the Big Otter River and the village of Evington. The state highway, now named Colonial Highway, intersects US 29 (Wards Road) at Yellow Branch on its way to Rustburg, which sits at the southern end of Long Mountain. SR 24 runs concurrently through the county seat with US 501, which heads south as Brookneal Highway toward Brookneal and north as Campbell Highway toward Lynchburg.
SR 24 continues northeast as Village Highway to Concord, where the state highway joins US 460 (Richmond Highway). The four-lane divided highway immediately enters Appomattox County, where the two highways pass through Spout Spring on their way to the county seat of Appomattox. US 460 and SR 24 have a diamond interchange with US 460 Business and the south end of SR 26 (Oakville Road) on the northwest side of the town. SR 24 and US 460 diverge at the following diamond interchange with Old Courthouse Road, which heads south toward the Appomattox Historic District as SR 131. SR 24 heads northeast as a two-lane undivided road through Appomattox Court House National Historical Park, within which the highway crosses the headwaters of the Appomattox River. The state highway heads through the hamlet of Vera and passes through sections of Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest as the highway enters Buckingham County and becomes named Mt. Rush Highway. SR 24 passes through Sliders and crosses the upper reaches of the Slate River before reaching its eastern terminus at US 60 (James Anderson Highway) in Mt. Rush.

Gabe's

Gabriel Brothers, Inc. (doing business as Gabe's) is an American off-price department store chain headquartered in Morgantown, West Virginia, United States. As of 2023, there are 131 Gabe's stores and 38 Old Time Pottery stores across 20 states, with the support of six distribution centers serving the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Southeast.
History.
In the early 1920s, Zaghieb G. "Z.G." Gabriel began selling merchandise out of the back of a green-paneled truck he had outfitted with shelves and drawers. As he drove his mobile shop through the coal towns of Fayette County, Pennsylvania, he greeted and got to know his customers, seeing firsthand the need for inexpensive merchandise. Z.G. began to hop freight trains bound for New York City, taking empty duffle bags with him. There, he would buy up excess inventory from shops, returning with bags full of merchandise to sell at deep discounts.
In 1961, Z.G.'s two sons, James and Arthur, co-founded Gabriel Brothers in Morgantown, West Virginia. Through the 1980s and 1990s, the brothers led Gabe's through an expansion into various states including Maryland, Ohio, and Virginia.
On March 21, 2012, the Gabriel family sold its majority interest in the company to Alvarez &amp; Marsal Capital, a New York City-based middle-market private equity firm. In 2013, the stores were rebranded as "Gabe's", but retained "Gabriel Brothers" as its legal name.
On December 22, 2016, Alvarez &amp; Marsal Capital sold their stake to Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm also based in New York City.
In April 2023, Gabe's acquired the Tennessee-based, home merchandise chain Old Time Pottery.
As of 2024, there are 131 Gabe's and 34 Old Time Pottery store locations in 20 states: Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.

Multiple Sclerosis International Federation

The Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF) was established in 1967 as an international body linking the activities of various national MS societies. The federation seeks to partner with member societies and the international scientific community to eliminate multiple sclerosis and its consequences, and to advocate for those affected by multiple sclerosis.
MSIF has the following key priorities:
History.
Since its establishment in 1967, MSIF has grown to link the work of 48 member MS societies worldwide. MSIF is in touch with many other emerging societies, and aims to support all MS societies in their development. MSIF has a budget of around £2 million per year, with most funding coming from member societies, charitable foundations and fundraising campaigns. Around a quarter of its income comes from the health care industry.
In cooperation with the World Health Organization, MSIF has published the most extensive source of global data about the epidemiology of MS, the "Atlas of MS". The most recent edition of the Atlas of MS was published in 2020, and shows that there are 2.8 million people living with MS globally.
MSIF supports the "International Pediatric MS Study Group" (IPMSSG) - a group of medical professionals from all continents working to improve the treatment of children with MS, and to undertake international research into childhood MS.
In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, MSIF gathered MS research experts and clinicians from around the world to produce global COVID-19 advice for people with MS. This has been updated at various intervals throughout the pandemic as new evidence has emerged. MSIF collaborated with the MS Data Alliance to establish the COVID-19 and MS Global Data Sharing Initiative. This collected data on how the coronavirus impacted people with MS and the results informed the global COVID-19 advice for people with MS.
World Multiple Sclerosis Day.
Since May 2009, MSIF has organized a World Multiple Sclerosis Day, which is now supported by MS organizations and individuals in around 100 countries. The purpose of the day is to raise awareness of MS as a global issue and make changes in the lives of people with MS. It is "A day to celebrate global solidarity and hope for the future"
World MS Day is officially marked on 30 May every year, though events and campaigns take place throughout the month of May.
The theme for World MS Day 2020-2022 is 'MS Connections'. The campaign focuses on building community connection, self-connection and connections to quality care.
The campaign tagline is ‘I Connect, We Connect’ and the campaign hashtag is #MSConnections.MS Connections challenges social barriers that leave people affected by MS feeling lonely and socially isolated. It is an opportunity to advocate for better services, celebrate support networks and champion self-care.

USS Seaman

"Seaman" (DD-791) was a of the United States Navy, named for Lieutenant Commander Allen L. Seaman (1916–1944), a naval aviator who was awarded two Navy Crosses for service in the Pacific War.
"Seaman" was laid down on 10 July 1945 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation, Seattle, Washington; launched on 29 May 1946; sponsored by Mrs. Barbara K. Seaman, widow of Lt. Comdr. Seaman; and delivered, partially complete, on 25 June 1946 to the officer-in-charge of demobilized shipping for the 13th Naval District.
Never commissioned, the destroyer was subsequently placed in the Bremerton Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, where she remained until struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1961. Her hulk was sold to the First Steel and Ship Corp., New York City, on 12 September 1961, and was delivered to the Learner Co., Alameda, California, on 22 September 1961 for scrapping.

OTA bitmap

OTA Bitmap (Over The Air Bitmap) was a specification designed by Nokia for black and white images for mobile phones.
The OTA Bitmap was defined by Nokia as part of their Smart Messaging specification, to send pictures as a series of one or more concatenated SMS text messages. The format has a maximum size of 255x255 pixels. It is very rare for an OTA bitmap to measure anything other than 72x28 pixels (for Picture Messages) or 72x14/72x13 pixels (for Operator Logos). The specification contains a byte of data to be used for indicating a multicolour image. This was to future-proof the standard, but the advent of MMS meant it never got to implementation.
Basic format description.
The OTA Bitmap format is a monochrome, uncompressed format using one bit per pixel. As the format was designed for cellular phones, there is no standard computer format. It may be stored as a binary file or as hex (usually without spaces) in a text file. Recognized extension is .otb.
The data header.
Before the image itself there is a header. The header is four bytes wide. A typical example is:
codice_1. These are:
 00 The 'Infofield' (always remains as 00).
 48 The width of the bitmap, 72 pixels in this case (48 is hex for 72).
 1C The height of the bitmap, 28 pixels in this case (1C is hex for 28).
 01 The number of colours (always 1).
Other possibilities may be: codice_2 (for 72x14 bitmaps), codice_3 (for 72x13 bitmaps).
Encoding the pixels.
After the header the image itself starts.
This example will use the following 72x28 pixel image.
The first 8 pixels, reading right from the top left hand corner are one white (0) followed by seven blacks (1111111), giving the first byte, in Binary, as 01111111.
Converting from the binary 01111111 to hex, results in the first byte that represents the pixels (7F). The next 8 characters are 8 blacks (11111111 or FF) and so on.
When all pixels from the top row are encoded, simply move to the next. There are no markers to indicate a new row, that information is contained in the header.
In the case of an OTA bitmap that is not a multiple of eight pixels in width, a single byte is used to convey information from two lines (e.g. two pixels from the first row and six from the second.) This is not the case in some other formats, so it is important to exercise care when converting between OTA and formats like WBMP.
Putting it together.
Here is the result of the image converted to OTA.

Doug Johnson (American football)

Doug Johnson Jr. (born October 27, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for five seasons in the National Football League (NFL) during the early 2000s. Johnson played college football for the Florida Gators, and thereafter, he played professionally for the Atlanta Falcons, the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Cincinnati Bengals, the Cleveland Browns, and the Tennessee Titans of the NFL. He is in the Florida Georgia Hall of Fame, and played in minor league baseball for the Tampa Bay Rays organization.
Early life.
Johnson was born in Gainesville, Florida in 1977. He attended in Buchholz High School in Gainesville, where he was a stand-out high school football and baseball player for the Buchholz Bobcats.
College career.
Johnson accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, where he was a quarterback for coach Steve Spurrier's Gators teams from 1996 to 1999. Memorably, Johnson threw for 460 yards and seven touchdowns against the Central Michigan Chippewas in 1997, setting a Southeastern Conference (SEC) record for most touchdown passes in a game, and an NCAA Division I record for most touchdown passes in a half. In three seasons as the Gators' principal starter, he threw for 7,114 yards, sixty-two touchdowns and thirty-six interceptions, completing 504 of 907 attempts, and was selected as a team captain as a senior.
Professional career.
After graduating from Florida, Johnson was not selected in the 2000 NFL draft, but signed with the Atlanta Falcons as a free agent. As an Atlanta Falcon in 2002, Johnson led the team to a 17–10 victory in a start against the New York Giants. In the game, Johnson completed 19 of 25 passes for 257 yards and one passing and one rushing touchdown. In four seasons with the Falcons, he started eleven games and passed for 2,600 yards. He has since played three additional seasons, mostly as a back-up or practice squad quarterback for three different teams. On September 1, 2007, he was released by the Cincinnati Bengals after playing the preseason as a backup to Carson Palmer.
Johnson was also a second-round draft pick in 1996 for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, playing as a third baseman in their minor league system in 1996 and 1997 before suffering a rotator cuff injury and leaving to concentrate on football full-time.
Football Outsiders uses the term called "the Doug Johnson Effect," referring to "part-time players who had a very good performance the previous season in only one or two games," as a caution against overvaluing NFL players for the next season.

Get Wild

"Get Wild" is a song by the New Power Generation, and the first single from their 1995 album "Exodus". The song was a hit in the UK, reaching number 19 on the UK Singles Chart.
"Get Wild" is a funk song in the style of Parliament and Funkadelic. The lead vocals are by Sonny T., with Prince delivering a rap during the bridge and some Spanish vocals provided by Mayte. A maxi-single was released with several remixes of the song.
A remix of "Get Wild" was played in the 1994 film "Prêt-à-Porter" and was included on the soundtrack album. A video featuring cameo scenes with Lolly Pop and various others was shot at Glam Slam Minneapolis, but was shelved by Warner Bros.
Prince's rap from "Get Wild" was later reused in a promotional remix of the "Gold Experience" track "P. Control".
The B-side of the single was another album track, the psychedelic "Hallucination Rain". This mid-tempo track is mainly spoken but builds into a soaring crescendo of noise and thundering drums in which Prince's voice can be clearly heard at the end. The single also includes the song "Beautiful Girl", a remix of Prince's 1994 hit "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World".
In 1995, Prince released a perfume called "Get Wild", inspired by the song. It was sold through Prince's mail order retail outlet and New Power Generation stores until 1999. In June 1995, author Jackie Collins sued Prince, claiming he copied the name and design from her own "Wild!" fragrance.

<doc id="7007464" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7007464" title="Modern history of Yemen">
Modern history of Yemen

The modern history of Yemen began with the withdrawal of the Ottoman Empire. In 1839 the British set up a protective area around the southern port of Aden and in 1918 the northern Kingdom of Yemen gained independence from the Ottoman Empire. North Yemen became a republic in 1962, but it was not until 1967 that the British Empire withdrew from what became South Yemen. In 1970, the southern government adopted a communist governmental system. The two countries were officially united as the Republic of Yemen on May 22, 1990.
North Yemen.
Kingdom.
The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, established in 1918, was an autocratic, theocratic state governed under an absolute monarchy. The majority of the population spoke Arabic, with a minority speaking Yemenite Hebrew. Religiously, approximately 55% of the population were Zaydi Muslims, 45% Sunni Muslims, and a small portion were historically Jewish.
Following Imam Yahya's assassination in 1948, his son Ahmad bin Yahya ascended the throne. In 1958, Yemen joined the United Arab States under pressure from Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. However, after Syria's departure from the union in 1961, Yemen also withdrew. The monarchy was eventually overthrown in 1962 following a coup led by Abdullah al-Sallal, supported by Egypt, resulting in the establishment of the Yemen Arab Republic.
Republic.
Shortly after assuming power in 1962, Ahmad's son, the Imam Muhammad al-Badr was deposed by revolutionary forces, who took control of Sana'a and created the "Yemen Arab Republic" (YAR). Egypt assisted the YAR with troops and supplies to combat forces loyal to the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia and Jordan supported Badr's royalist forces to oppose the newly formed republic starting the North Yemen Civil War. Conflict continued periodically until 1967 when Egyptian troops were withdrawn. By 1968, following a final royalist siege of Sana'a, most of the opposing leaders reached a reconciliation and Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic in 1970.
South Yemen.
British domain, Colony of Aden and Aden protectorate.
British interests in the area which would later become South Yemen, began to grow when in 1839, British East India Company forces captured the port of Aden, to provide a coaling station for ships en route to India. The colony, known as the Aden Settlement, gained much political and strategic importance after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.
Aden was ruled as part of British India until 1937, when the city of Aden became the Colony of Aden, a crown colony in its own right. The Aden hinterland and Hadhramaut to the east formed the remainder of what would become South Yemen and was not administered directly by Aden but were tied to Britain by treaties of protection. Starting in the latter decades of the 19th century and continuing into the 20th century, Britain signed agreements with local rulers of traditional polities that, together, became known as the Aden Protectorate. The area was divided into numerous sultanates, emirates, and sheikhdoms, and was divided for administrative purposes into the East Aden Protectorate and the West Aden Protectorate. The eastern protectorate consisted of the three Hadhramaut states (Qu'aiti State of Shihr and Mukalla, Kathiri State of Seiyun, Mahra Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra) with the remaining states comprising the west. Economic development was largely centred in Aden, and while the city flourished partly due to the discovery of crude oil on the Arabian Peninsula in the 1930s, the states of the Aden Protectorate stagnated.
Encouraged by the rhetoric of President Nasser of Egypt against British colonial rule in the Middle East, pressure for the British to leave grew. Following Nasser's creation of the United Arab Republic, attempts to incorporate Yemen in turn threatened Aden and the Protectorate. To counter this, the British attempted to unite the various states under its protection and, on 11 February 1959, six of the West Aden Protectorate states formed the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South to which nine other states were subsequently added. During the 1960s, the British sought to incorporate all of the Aden Protectorate territories into the Federation. On 18 January 1963, the Colony of Aden was incorporated against the wishes of much of the city's populace as the State of Aden and the Federation was renamed the Federation of South Arabia. Several more states subsequently joined the Federation and the remaining states that declined to join, mainly in Hadhramaut, formed the Protectorate of South Arabia.
In 1963, fighting between Egyptian forces and British-led Saudi-financed guerrillas in the Yemen Arab Republic spread to South Arabia with the formation of the National Liberation Front (NLF), who hoped to force the British out of South Arabia. Hostilities started with a grenade attack by the NLF against the British High Commissioner on 10 December 1963, killing one person and injuring fifty, and a state of emergency was declared, becoming known as the Aden Emergency.
In 1964, the new British government under Harold Wilson announced their intention to hand over power to the Federation of South Arabia in 1968, but that the British military would remain. There were around 280 guerrilla attacks in 1964, and over 500 in 1965. In 1966, the British Government announced that all British forces would be withdrawn at independence. In response, the security situation deteriorated with the creation of the socialist Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) which started to attack the NLF in a bid for power, as well as attacking the British.
In January 1967, there were mass riots by NLF and FLOSY supporters in the old Arab quarter of Aden town, which continued until mid February, despite the intervention of British troops. During the period there were many attacks on the troops, and an Aden Airways Douglas DC-3 plane was destroyed in the air with no survivors. At the same time, the members of FLOSY and the NLF were also killing each other in large numbers.
The temporary closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 effectively negated the last reason that British had kept hold of the colonies in Yemen, and, in the face of uncontrollable violence, they began to withdraw.
On 20 June 1967, there was a mutiny in the Federation of South Arabia Army, which also spread to the police. Order was restored by the British, mainly due to the efforts of the 1st Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, under the command of Lt-Col. Colin Mitchell.
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (1967–1990).
The British pulled out on 30 November 1967, leaving Aden under NLF control. The Royal Marines, who had been the first British troops to occupy Aden in 1839, were the last to leave. The Federation of South Arabia collapsed, and Southern Yemen became independent as the People's Republic of South Yemen. The NLF, with the support of the army, attained total control of the new state after defeating the FLOSY and the states of the former Federation in a drawn out campaign of terror.
In June 1969, a Marxist wing of the NLF gained power and changed the country's name to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) on 1 December 1970. In the PDRY, all political parties were amalgamated into the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), which became the only legal party. The PDRY established close ties with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Cuba, and Palestine.
These major communist powers assisted in the building of the PDRY's armed forces. Strong support from Moscow resulted in the Soviet Navy gaining access to naval facilities in South Yemen.
Relations between North Yemen and South Yemen.
1972 conflict.
Although the governments of the PDRY and the YAR declared that they approved a future union in 1972, little progress was made toward unification, and relations were often strained. A declaration was made in 1972 that unification would eventually occur. However, fighting erupted between North Yemen and South Yemen in October of that year; North Yemen was supplied by Saudi Arabia and South Yemen by the USSR. The fighting was short-lived, and led to the Cairo Agreement of October 28, 1972, which put forward a plan to unify the two countries.
1979 conflict.
Fighting broke out again in February and March 1979, with South Yemen allegedly supplying aid to rebels in the north through the National Democratic Front and crossing the border. Southern forces made it as far as the city of Taizz before withdrawing. This conflict was also short-lived. The war was only stopped by an Arab League intervention. The goal of unity was reaffirmed by the northern and southern heads of state during a summit meeting in Kuwait in March 1979.
What the PDRY government failed to tell the YAR government was that it wished to be the dominant power in any unification, and left wing rebels in North Yemen began to receive extensive funding and arms from South Yemen.
1980s.
In 1980, PDRY president Abdul Fattah Ismail resigned and went into exile. His successor, Ali Nasir Muhammad, took a less interventionist stance toward both North Yemen and neighbouring Oman.
South Yemen Civil War.
On January 13, 1986, a civil war broke out in Aden between Ali Nasir's supporters and supporters of the returned Ismail, who wanted power back. Fighting lasted for more than a month and resulted in thousands of casualties, Ali Nasir's ousting, and Ismail's death. Some 60,000 people, including the deposed Ali Nasir, fled to the YAR.
Unification talks (1988-1990).
In May 1988, the YAR and PDRY governments came to an understanding that considerably reduced tensions including agreement to renew discussions concerning unification, to establish a joint oil exploration area along their undefined border, to demilitarize the border, and to allow Yemenis unrestricted border passage on the basis of only a national identification card.
In November 1989, the leaders of the YAR (Ali Abdullah Saleh) and the PDRY (Ali Salim al-Baidh) agreed on a draft unity constitution originally drawn up in 1981.
Efforts toward unification proceeded from 1988 and, on May 22, 1990, the Republic of Yemen's independence was declared.
Republic of Yemen.
Unification and transitional period.
The Republic of Yemen (ROY) was declared on 22 May 1990 with Saleh becoming President and al-Baidh Vice President. For the first time in centuries, much of geographical Greater Yemen was politically united.
A 30-month transitional period for completing the unification of the two political and economic systems was set. A presidential council was jointly elected by the 26-member YAR advisory council and the 17-member PDRY presidium. The presidential council appointed a Prime Minister, who formed a Cabinet. There was also a 301-seat provisional unified parliament, consisting of 159 members from the north, 111 members from the south, and 31 independent members appointed by the chairman of the council.
A unity constitution was agreed upon in May 1990 and ratified by the populace in May 1991. It affirmed Yemen's commitment to free elections, a multiparty political system, the right to own private property, equality under the law, and respect of basic human rights. Parliamentary elections were held on 27 April 1993. International groups assisted in the organization of the elections and observed actual balloting. The resulting Parliament included 143 GPC, 69 YSP, 63 Islaah (Yemeni grouping for reform, a party composed of various tribal and religious groups), 6 Baathis, 3 Nasserists, 2 Al Haq, and 15 independents.
Islaah was invited into the ruling coalition, and the presidential council was altered to include one Islaah member. Conflicts within the coalition resulted in the self-imposed exile of Vice President Ali Salim Al-Bidh to Aden beginning in August 1993 and a deterioration in the general security situation as political rivals settled scores and tribal elements took advantage of the unsettled situation.
1994 civil war.
Haydar Abu Bakr Al-Attas, the former PDRY Prime Minister continued to serve as the ROY Prime Minister, but his government was ineffective due to political infighting. Continuous negotiations between northern and southern leaders resulted in the signing of the document of pledge and accord in Amman, Jordan on 20 February 1994. Despite this, clashes intensified until civil war broke out in early May 1994.
Almost all of the actual fighting in the 1994 civil war occurred in the southern part of the country despite air and missile attacks against cities and major installations in the north. The United States strongly supported stopping the war and called for a cease-fire and a return to the negotiating table. Various attempts, including by a UN special envoy, were unsuccessful to effect a cease-fire.
Southern leaders declared secession and the establishment of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" (DRY) on 21 May 1994, but the DRY was not recognized by the international community. Ali Nasir Muhammad supporters greatly assisted military operations against the secessionists and Aden was occupied on 7 July 1994. Other resistance quickly collapsed and thousands of southern leaders and military went into exile.
Early during the fighting, President Ali Abdallah Salih announced a general amnesty which applied to everyone except a list of 16 persons. Most southerners returned to Yemen after a short exile. An armed opposition was announced from Saudi Arabia, but no significant incidents within Yemen materialized. The government prepared legal cases against four southern leaders--Ali Salim al-Baidh, Haydar Abu Bakr Al-Attas, Abd Al-Rahman Ali Al-Jifri, and Salih Munassar Al-Siyali—for misappropriation of official funds. Others on the list of 16 were told informally they could return to take advantage of the amnesty, but most remained outside Yemen. Although many of Ali Nasir Muhammad's followers were appointed to senior governmental positions (including Vice President, Chief of Staff, and Governor of Aden), Ali Nasir Muhammad himself remained abroad in Syria.
Mid 1990s.
1994 Constitutional Amendments and Presidential Election.
In 1994, Yemen amended its unity constitution, abolishing the Presidential Council and establishing a system where the President would be elected by Parliament. Subsequently, on 1 October 1994, President Ali Abdullah Saleh was elected by Parliament to a five-year term.
1997 Parliamentary Elections.
Yemen conducted its second multiparty parliamentary elections in April 1997. The General People's Congress, led by President Saleh, secured a significant majority, consolidating its political influence. These elections were part of Yemen's ongoing efforts to establish a democratic political system following unification.
1999 Presidential Election.
The first direct presidential election in Yemen took place on 13 September 1999. President Ali Abdullah Saleh was elected to a seven-year term, receiving 96.2% of the vote. His sole opponent, Najeeb Qahtan al-Shaabi, an independent candidate and son of South Yemen's former president, garnered 3.8% of the vote.
2000s.
On October 12, 2000, the USS "Cole" - an American guided missile destroyer - was attacked by waterborne terrorists as the American ship was refueling in the port of Aden. Two suicide bombers approached the Cole in a small boat loaded with explosives. Once alongside the ship, the men detonated the explosives, killing themselves and 17 American sailors. It was later determined the bombers were part of Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaida terrorist network.
Constitutional amendments adopted in the summer of 2000 extended the presidential term by 2 years, thus moving the next presidential elections to 2006. The amendments also extended the parliamentary term of office to a 6-year term, thus moving elections for these seats to 2003. On 20 February 2001, a new constitutional amendment created a bicameral legislature, the Assembly of Representatives of Yemen, consisting of a Shura Council (111 seats; members appointed by the president) and a House of Representatives (301 seats; members elected by popular vote).
In the 2000s the government has been fighting rebel groups such as the one led by Hussein al-Houthi's Zaydi movement Shabab al-Mu'mineen, "The Young Believers".
2011 Yemeni Revolution and subsequent crisis.
The 2011 Yemeni protests followed the initial stages of the Tunisian revolution and occurred simultaneously with the Egyptian Revolution and other mass protests in the Arab world in early 2011. The protests were initially against unemployment, economic conditions and corruption, as well as against the government's proposals to modify the constitution of Yemen. The protestors' demands then escalated to calls for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to resign.
A major demonstration of over 16,000 protestors took place in Sana'a on 27 January. On 2 February, President Saleh announced he would not run for reelection in 2013 and that he would not pass power to his son. On 3 February, 20,000 people protested against the government in Sana'a, others protested in Aden, in a "Day of Rage" called for by Tawakel Karman, while soldiers, armed members of the General People's Congress and many protestors held a pro-government rally in Sana'a. In a "Friday of Anger" on 18 February, tens of thousands of Yemenis took part in anti-government demonstrations in Taiz, Sana'a and Aden. On a "Friday of No Return" on 11 March, protestors called for the ousting of Saleh in Sana'a where three people were killed. More protests were held in other cities, including Mukalla, where one person was killed. On 18 March, protesters in Sana'a were fired upon resulting in over 40 deaths and ultimately culminating in mass defections and resignations.
On 23 April Saleh accepted a proposal to step down and shift control to his deputy after thirty days. The agreement included immunity for him and his family and further required the opposition to stop public protests and join a coalition with Saleh's ruling party. Reactions to Saleh's acceptance have been reserved, without the agreement formalized or accepted by both sides and with the possibility of the stand-off continuing.
On 22 May Saleh had agreed to the deal only to back away hours before the scheduled signing for the third time. On 23 May Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar, the head of the Hashid tribal federation, one of the most powerful tribes in the country, declared support for the opposition and his armed supporters came into conflict with loyalist security forces in the capital Sana'a. Heavy street fighting ensued, which included artillery and mortar shelling.
Saleh and several others were injured and at least five people were killed by a 3 June rocket attack on the presidential compound when ordnance struck a mosque used by high-level government officials for prayer services. The next day, Vice President Abd al-Rab Mansur al-Hadi took over as acting president while Saleh flew to Saudi Arabia to be treated. As Saleh flew to the Saudi capital of Riyadh for surgery on 4 June, a cease-fire was brokered by Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah.
In early July the government had repeatedly rejected the opposition's demands, including the formation of a transitional council with the goal of formally transferring power from the current administration to a caretaker government intended to oversee Yemen's first-ever democratic elections. In response, factions of the opposition announced the formation of their own 17-member transitional council on 16 July, though the Joint Meeting Parties that have functioned as an umbrella for many of the Yemeni opposition groups during the uprising said the council did not represent them and did not match their "plan" for the country.
Post Yemeni Revolution (2011-Present).
Transition of power and political challenges.
Following President Ali Abdullah Saleh's departure in early 2012, his vice president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, assumed leadership amid expectations of democratic reforms. However, Hadi's administration struggled with internal divisions, economic challenges, and the rise of militant groups, notably the Houthi rebels in the north.
Houthi rebellion and escalation.
In September 2014, the Houthis seized control of Yemen's capital, Sana'a, and later expanded their influence to other regions, including the strategic port city of Hodeidah. This move significantly altered the country's power dynamics and led to the formation of a unity government.
Saudi-Led intervention and ongoing conflict.
In March 2015, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia initiated an air campaign aimed at restoring Hadi's government. This intervention marked the beginning of a protracted conflict that has resulted in thousands of deaths and a severe humanitarian crisis.
2025 Developments.
As of March 2025, the conflict persisted with no definitive resolution in sight. The U.S. faced scrutiny over its military actions in Yemen, particularly regarding civilian casualties and the effectiveness of its strategies against Houthi forces. A leak of U.S. military plans targeting the Houthis sparked controversy and renewed debates about the conduct and objectives of foreign interventions in Yemen.

Ayr Gold Cup

The Ayr Gold Cup is a flat handicap horse race in Great Britain open to thoroughbreds aged three years or older. It is run at Ayr over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.
History.
The event was established in 1804, and it was originally held at Ayr's former racecourse at Belleisle. In the early part of its history it was restricted to horses bred and trained in Scotland. It was initially contested over two separate heats of two miles, and was subsequently a single race with a two-mile distance.
The Ayr Gold Cup became a handicap in 1855, and it was shortened to about a mile in 1870. The Belleisle track closed in 1907, and the race was relocated and cut to 6 furlongs in 1908.
The lightest winning weight in the race since it became a sprint is 6 st 13 lb (44 kg). This was carried to victory by Marmaduke Jinks in 1936. The heaviest is 10 st (63½ kg), the burden of Roman Warrior in 1975. The latter horse, trained at Ayr by Nigel Angus, is the most recent winner trained in Scotland.
The field for the Ayr Gold Cup is formed from the highest-weighted horses entered for the race. The maximum number of runners is currently twenty-five. Those eliminated are now offered the chance to compete in the Ayr Silver Cup, a consolation race introduced in 1992. An event for horses excluded from "that" race, the Ayr Bronze Cup, was established in 2009.

Allen L. Seaman

Allen Lang Seaman was born on 21 December 1916 at New Haven, Connecticut, and educated at Duke University. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on 15 August 1938 and was ordered to Naval Air Station Pensacola as an Aviation Cadet five months later. Designated a Naval Aviator on 19 October 1939, he was commissioned Ensign in the Naval Reserve on 24 November.
After service in several patrol squadrons, he was assigned to a bomber squadron in May 1943. He flew many missions including long range reconnaissance and bombing missions in support of major task force strikes in October 1943 against Wake Island, for which he was awarded the Air Medal, and missions in support of the Allied thrust toward Hollandia, New Guinea, in April 1944, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.
Appointed Lieutenant Commander on 15 April 1944, Seaman was declared missing in action on 1 May 1944 after inflicting substantial damage on enemy land and sea forces in the New Guinea area despite damage to his own aircraft. For that action and for his judgment and skill in crash landing his plane in such a manner as to save several members of his crew, he was awarded the Navy Cross. Declared dead as of 1 May 1944, he was also awarded, posthumously, a 5/16 inch star in lieu of a second Navy Cross for the skill, leadership, and courage he consistently showed in pressing home, with great accuracy, low level strikes against enemy installations and shipping in the New Guinea area from November 1943 to March 1944.

Cobb's Battery

The 1st Kentucky Artillery (also known as Cobb's Battery) was an artillery battery that was a member of the Orphan Brigade in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. It fought in several engagements throughout the Western Theater, including the battles of Shiloh, Baton Rouge, Siege of Jackson, Sulphur Trestle, Resaca, Murfreesboro, Jonesborough, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and Johnsonville. Following the end of the Atlanta Campaign, Cobb's Battery was detached from the Orphan Brigade and reassigned to defend Mobile, Alabama.
Formation.
The battery was organized at the very outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 at Mint Springs, Kuttawa, Kentucky. Former United States Army Officer, Hylan B. Lyon—who had resigned his commission when war became inevitable—was elected the first Captain of the battery. However, due to Kentucky's official policy of neutrality during the early days of the conflict, Captain Lyon found that he could not train and drill his battery properly in Mint Springs. Consequently, the battery moved to Clarksville, Tennessee and enlisted as a group to join the Confederate States Army. At Camp Boone the battery was trained in artillery, and from this point forward was known either as the 1st Kentucky Artillery or Cobb's Kentucky Battery.
Following Lyon's promotion to General, Robert H. Cobb was made Captain of the battery; under his command the unit moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky, and was officially brought into John C. Breckinridge's 1st Kentucky Brigade, later to gain fame as the "Orphan" Brigade.
Armament.
The battery started its service with four M1841 6-pounder smoothbore guns and two 12-pounder M1841 mountain howitzers. By July 1863 it had acquired four M1857 12-pounder Napoleon Guns, and, by the Atlanta Campaign, it had acquired a total of six 12-pounder Napoleon Guns. Three of the Napoleon Guns were named by the battery after Orphan Brigade commanders' wives, "Lady Breckinridge," "Lady Buckner," and "Lady Helm."
Battles.
Shiloh.
The battery, listed on the Confederate Order of Battle as Lyon's Battery, took part in the Battle of Shiloh on 6 April 1862. Designated a reserve unit along with the remainder of Gen. Breckinridge's Division, the six-gun battery engaged the Federal Army at about 11:30 a.m., and its position was overrun by about noon, with all guns captured. The guns were subsequently recaptured by Confederate forces, but four removed from the field were not used again during the battle. The Shiloh National Military Park Marker also states that all horses were killed when the Federals overran the position, but another report indicates that horse belonging to Frank Gracey escaped death. That same report states that 34 members of the battery were killed in action during the combat. The battery could very well have been misnamed by Brig. Gen. Daniel Ruggles in his official report, calling the battery, "Captain Trabue's Kentucky," (which according to another Shiloh Military Park Marker, is a unit that is not mentioned another time in the Official Records, and Shiloh Military Park's Marker Finder attributes the location to "Cobb's Company.") which was used later in the day to reinforce the Confederate line, and also allowed Ruggles' Division to push further into the Federal line.
Baton Rouge.
During the Battle of Baton Rouge, 5 August 1862, Cobb's Battery was a participant only at the beginning of the battle. The battery was ordered to the rear while the battle was still being fought, and was able to escape the Battle of Baton Rouge without a single casualty due to enemy fire. However, while in the swampland between Vicksburg, Mississippi and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the entire Orphan Brigade was hit hard by malaria, to the point that by 11 August 1862, Cobb's Battery had dropped from 117 men fit for duty to only 36.
Chickamauga.
Cobb's Battery, along with Slocomb's Battery and the residue of the Orphan Brigade under the brigade command of Brig. Gen. Benjamin H. Helm, and making up a portion of Breckinridge's Division, was deployed across Glass' Ford with two cannons on 19 September 1863. During the ensuing artillery duel, the commands of Cobb, Slocomb, and Helm suffered 22 wounded or dead, which equaled the Union losses during the battle. On the following day, a portion of the battery was sent to Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest to assist in repelling the Union advance.
Missionary Ridge.
The battery, still in Breckinridge's Division, was set on the left flank of Bragg's Army of Tennessee, and was credited by Bragg with causing "much confusion before the enemy reached musket range." However, following the collapse of the Confederate defensive line on the ridge, guns "Lady Buckner" and "Lady Breckinridge" were captured by forces under Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan.

Virginia State Route 26

State Route 26 (SR 26) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. Known as Oakville Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 460 (US 460), SR 24, and US 460 Business in Appomattox north to US 60 in Bent Creek.
Route description.
SR 26 begins as a four-lane divided highway at a diamond interchange with US 460 and SR 24 (Richmond Highway) just north of the town of Appomattox. The roadway continues south of the expressway bypass of the town as US 460 Business (Confederate Boulevard), which leads to the Appomattox Historic District. SR 26 reduces to a two-lane undivided road and heads north as Oakville Road through northwestern Appomattox County. The state highway passes through the hamlet of Oakville. Near the northern end of SR 26, the highway descends into the narrow valley of Bent Creek. The state highway crosses the stream just south of the stream's mouth at the James River. A short distance to the north, SR 26 reaches its terminus at US 60 (James Anderson Highway) in the hamlet of Bent Creek just south of the U.S. Highway's crossing of the James River.
History.
The route originally continued south of Appomattox through to Charlotte and Halifax Counties, passing by what is now VA 40 in Phenix and ending at what is now VA 92 in the former town of Clover. The Appomattox-Phenix portion is now SR 727, while the Phenix-Clover portion is now SR 746.

Ambika Mata Temple

Ambika Mata Mandir is a Hindu temple located in the village of Jagat, about 50 km southeast of Udaipur in the state of Rajasthan, India. Ambika Devi, a form of Goddess Durga is the presiding deity of the temple. It was built under the reign of Rawal Allata of Mewar. The temple, located in a cleft of rock possesses a number of inscriptions. The earliest one, dated 961 AD, refers to a repair made to it. Today, the temple is preserved by the State Department of Archaeology and Museum, Rajasthan.
The temple is an early, transitional, example of the style known as Māru-Gurjara architecture.
This is a little-known temple, dating back to the tenth century with images of Durga and many other female divinities. Ambika, a form of the Hindu Goddess Durga, is the principal image in the shrine and worshipped as Shakti, a primeval source of energy. She is associated with Durga through her lion mount and is connected to the Jains through a vision advising Vimala about building his Adinath temple at Mount Abu.
Architecture.
The temple is also known as the "Khajuraho of Mewar". There are many fine sculptures in the temple which have been excellently preserved. This pentagonal temple, enclosed by a massive rampart wall, has 17 turrets and a pagoda-like gabled roof. Exquisite details appear high on the exterior walls of the temple, above larger sculptures of gods or goddesses, with musicians, dancers, and singers of the heavenly court, as well as countless beautiful women. The richness and arrangement of the carving often has a curling vegetal motif. The theme is of a mountain palace, a heavenly abode of the gods. The tower is covered with intricate motifs, including clouds, and is surrounded by small shikhara towers which echo the surrounding mountain peaks. The architecture of the mountain palace, as the heavenly abode of the gods, echoes the temple which is their earthly residence.
Sculptures.
As a Devi temple, most of the sculptures here represent either (1) Durga, the fierce devi, or (2) Lakshmi and other beneficent devis, or (3) Brahmani and other theoretical counterparts of the traditional (male) Hindu divinities.

Charles Neale

Charles Neale (1751–1823) was a leader of the Jesuit mission in America. Neale came from a prominent Catholic family of Maryland.
Family.
Charles Neale was born in Province of Maryland to a prominent family, descended from Captain James Neale, who had settled in the colony in 1642 with a royal grant of land of two thousand acres. Walleston Manor included Cobb Island, which is separated from the mainland by Neale Sound.
The family traced its origins to the noble O'Neill family of Ireland, from whom came the kings of Ulster. Among his ancestors were Roswell Neale (grandfather to Charles) and his brother, Father Bennett Neale, S.J., one of the first Jesuits in the English colony.
He was one of thirteen children born to William and Ann Brooke Neale of Chandler's Hope, the mansion of the Neale family, near Port Tobacco, Charles County, Maryland.
Early life.
At the age of about seven, Charles was sent to a Jesuit school in Bohemia, Cecil County where his brother Leonard was also a student. The school prepared those who could afford it to enter St. Omer’s in French Flanders for their college or seminary education. In 1760, Leonard and Charles set sail for St. Omer’s, accompanied by their sister Anne, who was joining the Carmelites at Lier, Belgium. When the Jesuits were expelled from France in 1764, the students relocated to Bruges.
On September 7, 1771, Charles Neale entered the same Jesuit novitiate in Ghent as his older brothers. Two years later, before he was able to take his religious vows as a Jesuit, Pope Clement XIV authorized the worldwide suppression of the Society of Jesus. Due to his poor health, Charles Neale joined other members of the suppressed Society who were continuing their seminary studies in Liege. There he was ordained around 1780. Shortly afterward, he became chaplain to an English-language community of Discalced Carmelite nuns in Antwerp. Their prioress, Mother Mary Margaret of the Angels, OCD, born Mary Brent in Maryland, was Neale's cousin through his grandmother, the wife of his grandfather, Roswell Neale.
Neale also served as confessor at the Carmel in Hoogstraten. During his ten years in Antwerp, he maintained contact with his friends and colleagues in Maryland. Through this dialogue, the nuns were encouraged to attempt a foundation in the new nation, the United States of America, which was just emerging from the American Revolution. Neale accompanied the nuns on their return voyage to Maryland. Initially, the intention was to have his cousin, Mother Mary Margaret, lead the new foundation, but she died in 1784. Instead the small community was led by Mother Bernardina Teresa Xavier of St. Joseph, OCD (born Ann Teresa Mathews), who was to serve as prioress. She was accompanied by her nieces, Sisters Mary Eleanora of St. Francis Xavier, OCD, and Mary Aloysia of the Blessed Trinity, OCD. Neale chose the final participant, Sister Clare Joseph of the Sacred Heart, OCD, an Englishwoman.
Voyage.
The small contingent sailed from the port of Texel on May 1, 1790, on a ship called "The Brothers", commanded by one Captain MacDougal, a Scotsman. 
Although the captain had advertised New York as the destination, he failed to advise the passengers that he was carrying cargo destined for the Canary Islands, which was a detour of some two thousand miles. The voyage was a difficult one, due both to the weather, and the lack of provisions, from the captain's unwillingness to provide adequate food for either the crew or passengers. Additionally, according to the account by the nuns, when they landed in Tenerife to drop off the cargo, local church authorities heard reports bandied about by the captain that the women were fleeing their monastery in order to marry the priests. Another priest on the ship, one surnamed Plunkett, went to the authorities to scotch the rumor. 
Nevertheless, Neale and the nuns stayed on board out of fear of being arrested by the Spanish Inquisition.
The ship finally arrived in New York on May 31. They stayed in the city for a month, sailing out on the Fourth of July, for Norfolk, Virginia, where they landed five days later. They then transferred to a sloop, for the final leg of the journey to Maryland, where they arrived on July 10. They then stayed for a week at the home of the brother of the late Mother Mary Margaret and Mr. Neale's cousin, before proceeding to Port Tobacco, St. Mary's County, the county seat, where Neale built them a house at his own expense.
Maryland.
After his return, Neale worked tirelessly to maintain the works of the Society from prior to the Suppression and to restore the Society of Jesus as an official Order. In 1803, the members of the Maryland Mission, consisting of the surviving former Jesuits, learned that, two years earlier, Pope Pius VII had approved the continuation of the Society in Russia, where the decree of suppression had never been implemented by the Empress Catherine the Great. 
As a Russian Orthodox ruler, she had no obligation to obey a papal order, and she valued the educational works of the Jesuits in the territories she ruled, particularly Poland. Thus in May of that year, Bishop John Carroll, the sole Ordinary for the entire nation, supported by his coadjutor bishop, Leonard Neale (Charles' brother), both of whom were former members of the Society, appealed to the new Father General in Russia that the former Jesuits in the United States be re-admitted to the Society, noting that the structure of the Jesuit Mission in Maryland had remained intact from the time of the Suppression up to that date. 
The Father General agreed and authorized the re-admission of the former Jesuits to the Society, appointing Father Robert Molyneux as Superior for the United States. Thus, Charles Neale was finally able to profess his vows as a Jesuit for the first time on August 18, 1805. 
The following summer, he was appointed Vice Superior for Charles and St. Mary's counties. Neale made his final profession of solemn vows on November 16 of that same year at the Jesuit church in Georgetown.
Upon the death of Molyneux in 1808, Father Neale was appointed to succeed him as Superior of the American Jesuit community. At that time (as had also occurred after his taking vows), Neale was instructed by the Father General to leave the direction of the Carmel he had founded, in order that he might help staff the institutions of the Society. Carroll, who was by then the Archbishop of the nation, again prevailed upon the Jesuit superiors to leave him in the duty to which he was so committed.
In December 1821, Father Anthony Kohlmann, S.J., then superior of the Mission, was succeeded by Father Neale. At this point Neale, always in feeble health, was in his advanced years. It was to be his third time carrying out the duties of that office.
At the time of his re-appointment, Father Neale was still working as chaplain and living with the community of Carmelite nuns at Port Tobacco. Father Kohlmann and Father Francis Dzierozynski, a Polish Jesuit who was newly arrived in America, went to inform Father Neale of his appointment and to bring some letters from Rome.
In light of the unsatisfactory conditions at White Marsh, Neale decided to transfer the Jesuit novitiate to St. Thomas Manor in St. Charles County, Maryland.
Father Neale died in 1823 and was buried in the graveyard of the monastery by order of Mother Clare Joseph, one of the nuns brought by him from Europe. She became prioress in 1800, and remained so until her death on March 27, 1830. The monastery moved to Baltimore in September 1831, at which time Father Neale's remains were relocated to the new location, along with those of ten nuns.

Soviet Second League

The Soviet Second League (, Soviet football championship (Second League)) was the third highest division of Soviet football, below the Soviet First League. The league was formed in 1971 in place of the Class A Second Group of the Soviet football championship just a year after the division was downgraded to the third tier. Previously, the third-tier competition predecessor Class B was liquidated completely. The Second League remained in force until dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Overview.
The Soviet third tier competitions were conducted since the establishment of the Soviet football championship among teams of masters in 1936. At first they were called as the Group V (Cyrillic letter of V) of the Soviet football championship, but was discontinued after the 1937. The experimental edition of the third-tier competition was re-introduced in 1946 as the Third Group of the Soviet football championship. But the consistent competitions really took off in 1963 when the Class B of the Soviet football championship was downgraded to the third tier.
The most titles of the League won was two by 11 different teams out of various now independent republics. The last winners of the League were FC Karpaty Lviv, FC Asmaral Moscow, and FC Okean Nakhodka.
Between 1963 and 1970 football competitions in Class B were split by republican principle at first as tier two, then as tier three, and at the end in 1970 it was downgraded to the auxiliary tier four (or lower tier three). Each territorial Class B competition had multiple number of sub-groups that were known as zones. Winners of each territorial (republican) Class B was granted promotion to Class A Second Group (First League). Also on occasions, there were relegation play-offs to allow rotation for the collective of physical culture (KFK).
In 1970–71, the Soviet league system was restructured for lower leagues and Class B competitions were discontinued. Republican competitions were conducted with the Soviet Second League which consisted of multiple groups (zones). There was no explicit designation of zones as they were simply numerated. Initially the league consisted of six groups, but for the next couple of season was increased to seven before reducing back to six again. Normally winners of group were getting promoted to the First League.
In 1980 the league was expanded to 9 groups, winners of which qualified for a mini-tournament that consisted of three groups with three teams. The three winners of that mini-tournament received promotion to the First League. This format remained in place until 1989.
Republican competitions continued to be conducted among collective of physical culture and were considered as amateur.
In 1990 the league again went through another transformation reducing the number of groups from 9 to 3, winners of which would have been promoted to the First League. Due to withdrawal of teams, promotion and relegation was disrupted and the 1991 season became the last.
Winners.
All-time table (top 20).
There were over 520 teams that played in the third tier competitions.
1Three points for a win. In 1973, a point for a draw was awarded only to a team that won the subsequent penalty shootout. In 1978–1988, the number of draws for which points were awarded was limited.

Viktor Röthlin

Viktor Röthlin (born October 14, 1974 in Kerns, Obwalden) is a Swiss former long-distance runner, who specialized in the marathon.
Röthlin won the silver medal at the 2006 European Championships in Gothenburg, Sweden, the bronze medal at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan, and the gold medal at the 2010 European Championships in Barcelona, Spain.
He also competed in the marathon at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia (finishing 36th), at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece (where he did not finish), at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China (where he placed 6th in a time of 2:10:35) and at the 2012 Olympics in London, Great Britain (where he finished in 11th with a time of 2:12:48).
Röthlin has set four Swiss national records at the marathon distance: In September 2001 at the Berlin Marathon, his time of 2:10:54 eclipsed the previous Swiss national record of 2:11:10 (set by Daniel Boltz in 1991). In April 2004, in his victory at the Zürich Marathon, Röthlin lowered the national record to 2:09:56. In April 2007, he lowered the national record again, when he won the Zürich Marathon in a time of 2:08:20, and in February 2008, he once more improved the Swiss record to 2:07:23 when he won the Tokyo Marathon.
Röthlin attempted no marathons in 2009, because he contracted thrombosis during a flight from the United Arab Emirates in the Spring of 2009, which led to a pulmonary embolism and fluid buildup in his chest; the condition was treated with rest and medication.
At the 2012 Tokyo Marathon he had his fastest performance since his victory in 2008, as he finished fifth with a time of 2:08:32 hours.
Röthlin retired from competitive marathon running in 2014, after finishing fifth at the European Championships in Zürich.
Since retiring, Röthlin has been active in coaching, becoming the coach of Matthias Kyburz in 2024.

2006 North American E. coli outbreak in spinach

The 2006 North American "E. coli" outbreak was an outbreak from prepackaged spinach reported in 27 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Ontario. The outbreak cases spanned from August 30 to October 6, and its origin was traced back to a farm in San Benito County, California. At least 276 consumer illnesses and 3 deaths were attributed to the outbreak.
History.
In September 2006, there was an outbreak of foodborne illness caused by "Escherichia coli" ("E. coli") bacteria found in prepackaged spinach in 26 U.S. states. The initial reports of the outbreak came from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
By October 6, 2006, 199 people had been infected, including three people who died and 31 who developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic–uremic syndrome after eating spinach contaminated with , a potentially deadly bacterium that causes bloody diarrhea and dehydration. This strain is more potent than in any other food poisoning scares. Federal health officials said half of those reported sick have been hospitalized, compared to 25 to 30 percent in past outbreaks.
The FDA called for bagged fresh spinach to be removed from shelves and warned people not to eat any fresh spinach or fresh spinach-containing products. The FDA has also speculated that washing the spinach is insufficient to sanitize it because the bacteria is systemic, meaning that it is not just on the outside of the spinach, but that it has been absorbed through the roots and is now inside the spinach. This hypothesis has since been deemed only hypothetical, as there is no evidence that this can happen in spinach. The FDA has since reduced its warning to certain brands with specific dates.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency advised consumers not to eat fresh spinach from the U.S., including bagged, loose in bulk or in salad blends.
Cause.
The outbreak was traced to prepackaged spinach—sold as conventional produce—grown on a farm in San Benito County, California. Investigators with the CDC initially speculated that the dangerous strain of bacteria, , originated from irrigation water contaminated with cattle feces or from grazing deer.
A follow-up report by the CDC and a joint report by the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) and the U.S. FDA concluded that the probable source of the outbreak was Paicines Ranch, an Angus cattle ranch that had leased land to spinach grower Mission Organics. The report found 26 samples of "E. coli" "indistinguishable from the outbreak strain" in water and cattle manure on the San Benito County ranch, some within a mile from the tainted spinach fields. Although officials could not definitively say how the spinach became contaminated, both reports named the presence of wild pigs on the ranch and the proximity of surface waterways to irrigation wells as "potential environmental risk factors." The reports also noted that flaws in the spinach producer's transportation and processing systems could have further spread contamination. Paicines Ranch is not under investigation for its alleged role in the outbreak.
Soon after the reports were released, California's farm industry announced it would adopt "good agricultural practices" to reduce the risk of "E. coli" contamination for leafy green vegetables.
Two companies in California voluntarily recalled spinach and spinach-containing products: Natural Selection Foods LLC, based in San Juan Bautista, and River Ranch Fresh Foods. Natural Selection brands include Natural Selection Foods, Pride of San Juan, Earthbound Farm, Bellissima, Dole, Rave Spinach, Emeril, Sysco, O Organic, Fresh Point, River Ranch, Superior, Nature's Basket, Pro-Mark, Compliments, Trader Joe's, Jansal Valley, Cheney Brothers, D'Arrigo Brothers, Green Harvest, Mann, Mills Family Farm, Premium Fresh, Snoboy, The Farmer's Market, Tanimura &amp; Antle, President's Choice, Cross Valley, and Riverside Farms. Affected brands from River Ranch include Hy-Vee, Farmer's Market, and Fresh and Easy. Later, a third company, RLB Food Distributors, issued multiple East Coast states recalls of spinach-containing salad products for possible "E. coli" contamination. Natural Selection Foods announced on September 18, 2006, that its organic produce had been cleared of contamination by an independent agency, but did not lift the recalls on any of its organic brands. On September 22, Earthbound Farm announced that the FDA and the CDHS confirmed that its organic spinach had not been contaminated with "E. coli".
Impact.
The outbreak consisted of 26 states and provinces, with at least 200 reported cases. Three deaths were confirmed: an elderly woman in Wisconsin, a two-year-old in Idaho, and an elderly woman in Nebraska. The death of an elderly woman in Maryland was investigated, but DNA fingerprinting was not possible to confirm the death as a result of the outbreak. Spinach has also been distributed to Canada and Mexico; one case has been reported in Canada. At the time of the outbreak, there were over 400 produce-related outbreaks in North America since 1990.
The areas reported to be affected are:
Economic impact.
In California, where three-quarters of all domestically grown spinach are harvested, farmers could face up to $74 million in losses due to the "E. coli" outbreak. In 2005, the spinach crop in California was valued at $258.3 million, and each acre lost amounts to a roughly $3,500 loss for the farmer.
Online help.
The PulseNet system, part of the Association of Public Health Laboratories and coordinated by CDC, detected clusters of infection in two states, Oregon and Wisconsin, which initiated investigations in each state. The first cluster was detected on Friday, September 8, in one state, and the second cluster emerged in the second state on Wednesday, September 13, by which time PulseNet had also identified potential associated cases in other states.
The OutbreakNet, a group of state public health officers who investigate foodborne infection outbreaks, shared information with CDC that indicated that Oregon and Wisconsin were considering the same hypothesis: fresh spinach was the possible vehicle of infection. The group tracked and updated the increasing case count and exposure information. During a multistate call on Thursday, September 14, the group noted that the data strongly suggested fresh spinach was a likely source. Within 24 hours of the outbreak, the data indicated that the outbreak was probably ongoing.
CDC made communication to the public a priority by developing press releases, coordinating with FDA on press documents, conducting interviews with major media, and sending out notices on September 14 to the public health community via the Health Alert Network (HAN) and the Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X). By the next morning, the news media warned the U.S. population not to eat bagged spinach, with remarkable coverage.
Timeline.
September.
The Centers for Disease Control issued an official "Health Alert", the highest category of alert message, on September 14 and started to investigate the "E. coli" outbreak. The FDA warned consumers about an "E. coli" outbreak tied to fresh spinach bags. The FDA reported that they received complaints from 19 states in the United States. The FDA advised consumers not to eat bagged fresh spinach. Three days later, their updated warning said not to eat fresh spinach or fresh spinach-containing products. The United States also expanded the warning to avoid all fresh spinach. Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle formally requested federal aid on September 15. His office said the CDC will help assess the causes and the magnitude of the outbreak in his state.
On September 18, Illinois and Nebraska reported their first cases of "E. coli" infection due to spinach, bringing the total number of affected states to 21. Ohio public health officials investigated a two-year-old's death that may also be linked. The number of people sickened by the "E. coli" laced spinach reached 111.
On September 19, it was reported that there may be a link to a further death in Ohio and irrigation water is being investigated as a possible source.
This is the 9th outbreak traced to the Salinas Valley in California and the 25th leafy green "E. coli" outbreak (spinach or lettuce) in the United States since 1993.
On September 20, the CDC announced that the genetic fingerprint, a PFGE pattern, of "E. coli" O157 isolated from an opened package of Dole baby spinach packed by Natural Selection in the refrigerator of an ill New Mexico resident matched that of the outbreak strain.
On September 25, consumer advocates and lawmakers began urging tougher rules for fields and processing plants.
On September 29, the FDA downgraded the warning, reducing it to a warning against specific brands packaged on specific dates instead of fresh spinach.
October.
On October 5, 2006, the FBI launched a criminal investigation into the matter.
On October 26, 2006, some of the largest grocery chains, including Vons, Albertsons, Ralphs, and others, sent a letter to the farmer's associations, giving them six weeks to come up with a plan to prevent problems like the "E. coli" outbreak from happening again.

Description.
This perennial grows from deep rhizomes. The leaves are large, suborbicular and up to 20 cm across and stalked with small regular teeth. The species is dioecious, male and female flowers being borne on separate plants. The erect flower-heads grow in short racemes on stems up to 25 cm long with a few scale-leaves. The florets are pinkish-mauve and appear in December in Ireland and from January to March in Great Britain. The flowers have a vanilla-like scent. Other species to be found in Ireland and Great Britain: "Petasites hybridus" (L.) P.Gaertner, B. Meyer &amp; Scherb, "Petasites albus" (L.) Gaertner. and "Petasites japonicus" (Siebold &amp; Zucc.) Maxim.
Distribution.
"Petasites pyrenaicus" is native to the Mediterranean region of Europe, including Italy, Sicily, Sardinia and north Africa. It was introduced to Great Britain in 1806 where it has become naturalized. It was recorded in the wild by at least 1835 in Middlesex It is also introduced and naturalized in Ireland. Female plants are unknown in the British Isles. The male plant is grown as an ornamental in gardens and some churchyards, and was well established by the start of the 20th century.
Ecology.
Common on shady roadside banks. The underground rhizomes allow it to spread and its large leaves can shade out other plants. It is considered an invasive plant but can be controlled by cultivation or weedkiller.

James Ward (psychologist)

James Ward (27 January 1843 – 4 March 1925) was an English psychologist and philosopher. He was a Cambridge Apostle.
Life.
Ward was born in Kingston upon Hull, the eldest of nine children. His father was an unsuccessful merchant. Ward was educated at the Liverpool Institute and Mostyn House, but his formal schooling ended when his father became bankrupt.
Apprenticed to a Liverpool architect for four years, Ward studied Greek and logic and was a Sunday school teacher.
In 1863, he entered Spring Hill College, near Birmingham, to train for the Congregationalist ministry. An eccentric and impoverished student, he remained at Spring Hill until 1869, completing his theological studies as well as gaining a University of London BA degree.
In 1869–1870, Ward won a scholarship to Germany, where he attended the lectures of Isaac Dormer in Berlin before moving to Göttingen to study under Hermann Lotze. On his return to Britain Ward became minister at Emmanuel Congregational Church in Cambridge, where his theological liberalism unhappily antagonised his congregation. Sympathetic to Ward's predicament, Henry Sidgwick encouraged Ward to enter Cambridge University. Initially a non-collegiate student, Ward won a scholarship to Trinity College in 1873, and achieved a first class in the moral sciences tripos in 1874.
With a dissertation entitled "The Relation of Physiology to Psychology", Ward won a Trinity fellowship in 1875. Some of this work, "An Interpretation of Fechner's Law", was published in the first volume of the new journal "Mind" (1876).
For the rest of his life, the "Dictionary of National Biography" reports that he: 
During 1876–1877 he returned to Germany, studying in Carl Ludwig's Leipzig physiological institute. Back in Cambridge, Ward continued physiological research under Michael Foster, publishing a pair of physiological papers in 1879 and 1880.
From 1880 onwards Ward moved away from physiology to psychology. His article "Psychology" for the ninth edition of the "Encyclopædia Britannica" – criticising associationist psychology with an emphasis upon the mind's active attention to the world – became enormously influential.
Ward was a strong supporter of women's education, and met his Irish-born suffragist wife-to-be, Mary (née Martin), when she attended one of his series of lectures. The couple married in Nottingham on 31 July 1884, and settled in Cambridge in a house built for them by J. J. Stevenson. She went on to become a lecturer in moral sciences at Newnham College, and a member of the Ladies Dining Society. They had two daughters and a son.
Ward was elected to the new Chair of Mental Philosophy and Logic in 1897, his students including G. E. Moore, Bertrand Russell, Mohammed Iqbal and George Stout. He served as president of the Aristotelian Society from 1919 to 1920.
Ward died in Cambridge, and was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium.
Philosophical work.
Ward defended a philosophy of panpsychism based on his research in physiology and psychology which he defined as a "spiritualistic monism". In his Gifford Lectures and his book "Naturalism and Agnosticism" (1899) he argued against materialism and dualism and supported a form of panpsychism where reality consists in a plurality of centers of activity. Ward's philosophical views have a close affinity to the pluralistic idealism of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Ward had believed that the universe is composed of "psychic monads" of different levels, interacting for mutual self- betterment. His theological views have been described by some as a "personal panentheism".

Sam &amp; Mark's TMi Friday

Sam &amp; Mark's TMi Friday (originally TMi) is a British children's entertainment programme that was produced for five series by the BBC and aired from 16 September 2006 to 17 December 2010.
Format.
"TMi "launched on 16 September 2006 as a Saturday morning show, airing in the autumn/winter months on BBC Two, replacing former occupant Dick &amp; Dom in da Bungalow. Former Pop Idol contestants turned presenters Sam Nixon and Mark Rhodes, better known as Sam &amp; Mark, were joined by Caroline Flack for a mix of cartoons, competitions, games, music videos and celebrity guests. The first series had a reality theme to the proceedings, which had never been done before on a children's Saturday morning show. This consisted of Sam and Mark living in the 'TMi flat' throughout the week, mainly rehearsing or practising for their weekly head to head challenges in the studio. In 2007, it had been reported that TMi had used a fake phone-in caller during the game, Birthday Bingo, on the first show.
The second series in 2007 saw the demise of the TMi flat and the introduction of a new theme where each week the presenters encouraged viewers to become their 'friend' on the show's website. Nixon, Rhodes and Flack would participate in various challenges, mostly involving gunge, in the hope of gaining new friends. This series also saw a change of location from MTV in Leicester Square to TC9 at BBC Television Centre, and a reduced time slot from the original 165 to 90 minutes.
Flack would later leave the programme after the third series, though her departure was not officially announced until the start of the fourth series in 2009 by Nixon and Rhodes - the last that would air on Saturday mornings.
In 2010 the programme returned with a new slot of Friday evenings on the CBBC Channel, and a new name - "Sam &amp; Mark's TMi Friday".
The final edition was broadcast on 17 December 2010.

Hot Creek Range

The Hot Creek Range is a volcanic mountain range in Nye County, in central Nevada in the western United States. From the historic community of Warm Springs, the range runs north-northeast for approximately .
To the west are Stone Cabin Valley, Little Fish Lake Valley, and the large Monitor Range. To the east are Hot Creek Valley, Big Sand Springs Valley, and the Lunar Craters Volcanic Field. Further east lies the large Railroad Valley, and the Grant and Quinn Canyon Ranges. Highway 6 passes south of the range at Warm Springs Summit. To the north, the range almost merges with the smaller Antelope and Park Ranges.
The northern section of the Hot Creek Range has two distinct crests. The eastern crest rises to Morey Peak (), the highest point of the range. Nearby is the historic silver mining district of Morey. The western crest, across Sixmile Canyon, includes Mahogany Peak (), Hot Creek Canyon, and the rugged Fandango Wilderness Study Area.
The range took its name from a nearby hot spring.

Arthur's Pike

Arthur's Pike is a fell in the English Lake District, near Ullswater. It is a subsidiary top on the ridge falling north from Loadpot Hill in the Far Eastern Fells. An extensive craggy face stands above the lower reach of Ullswater.
Topography.
The fell is separated from Loadpot Hill by a broad depression just south east of the summit, the ground here being quite marshy. The descending ridge turns north east at Arthur's Pike, passing over the knoll of White Knott as it falls between Aik Beck and the lake, heading for Pooley Bridge. Wainwright chose to define the fell between these narrow limits, assigning the wider slopes around Moor Divock to Loadpot Hill, and that convention is followed here.
To the west of Arthur's Pike the land falls steeply to Swarthbeck. This stream divides the fell from its twin, Bonscale Pike, before flowing to Ullswater. The north western face of Arthur's Pike has several tiers of crag, dropping to a belt of cultivated land and then the lakeside road to Howtown.
Summit.
Arthur's Pike has a small summit set back from the crags on a grassy plateau. The remains of a beacon (columnar cairn) mark the brink of the face.
Ascents.
There is no clear path to the summit, but a little to the south east the High Street Roman road runs past. The obvious direct ascent is from Swarthbeck on the Howtown road, outflanking the crags to the north and making for White Knott on a good path. The top can also be reached from the Roman road, either northwards from Loadpot Hill or southwards from Pooley Bridge or Helton.

Soviet Second League B

The Soviet Second League B or Soviet Lower Second League was an auxiliary fourth tier of the Soviet league system, because it was not consistent as it existed only for six seasons and somewhat randomly. It was the fourth highest division of Soviet football, below the Soviet Second League.
Description.
It was introduced initially for three seasons (two tiers) at the inception of Soviet league football in 1936 as the "Group G" until 1938 when all teams were allowed to compete in one "Super League". At that time it consisted of a single group. At the first championships two of them occurred in 1936, it contained around five teams. In 1937 the league was increased to 12 participants. Also the same year another division was added that was lower than the Group G, called the Group D. Group D included two groups – one regular and another with the name "Cities of the East". The regular group consisted of 11 teams, while "Cities of the East" involved participation of only seven teams. The champions of the Group G became two teams: twice it was won by Traktor Factory Kharkiv (later Torpedo Kharkiv) and Traktor Stalingrad. In 1938 the league was discontinued.
Later it was revived in 1970 for just one season as the extension of the second League and under the name "Class B". It was divided into four republican sub-leagues: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Middle Asia. The Russian sub-league was divided further into four zones with five sub-groups. Number of participating clubs varied between 17 and 18. The Ukrainian sub-league contained two zones: one consisting of 13 clubs, another – 14. The Kazakhstani sub-league had 16 clubs participating and the Asian sub-league – 18. The total participants amounted to 149 clubs. Nine clubs from each zones were promoted, the rest attained status of amateurs. The league champions were: Russia – Motor Vladimir, Terek Grozny, Kord Balakovo, Sakhalin Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk; Ukraine – Khimik Severodonetsk; Kazakhstan – Tsementnik Semipalatinsk; Asia – Zarafshan Navoi from Zarafshan.
In 1990, the league was recreated to contain the nine regional zones that were previously a part of Soviet Second League, and an additional 10th zone (as well as replacement teams for those previously promoted were added). It was named as the Second Lower League. Later it was referred to as the Second League, while the Second League was renamed into the Buffer League. The winners of the zones would qualify for the Soviet Second League (Buffer League). Most notably, the 1st Zone represented Ukraine, 2nd – Armenia, 3rd – Azerbaijan, 4th – Southern Russia, 5th – Central Russia, Moldova, Belarus (later moved to the 6th), 6th – Baltic Russia, Baltic states, Moscow, 7th – Volga region, 8th Zone – Kazakhstan, 9th – Uzbekistan, 10th – Russia's Far East.
Note: major reorganizations of the League system took place in 1970, before introduction of the UEFA Cup and All-European League ranking, and later in 1989, before fall of the Soviet Union.

Tom Hausman

Thomas Matthew Hausman (March 31, 1953 – January 16, 2019) was a Major League Baseball pitcher. He was the first free agent signing of the New York Mets.
Early career.
Hausman was born in Mobridge, South Dakota, but moved to California as a child. He was an All-state baseball and basketball player, and pitched two years of American Legion ball in La Verne, California. The Milwaukee Brewers drafted the right hander right out of high school in the tenth round of the 1971 Major League Baseball draft.
Minor leagues.
Hausman spent his first professional baseball season in the class "A" New York–Penn League with the fourth-place Newark Co-Pilots. He appeared in thirteen games and 74 innings and allowed 54 hits and 30 walks. He struck out 54 and had an earned run average of 2.68.
His season was spent playing for Joe Nossek and the class "A" Midwest League champions in Danville. An injury placing him on the disabled list from June 13 to August 6, limiting his appearances to only ten games, with 55 innings pitched. He gave up 53 hits and 17 walks, struck out 32 and his ERA was a 2.13.
As a starter in , Hausman pitched 162 innings in 25 games at class "AA" Texas League for the Shreveport Captains. With a record of 12–9, he allowed 193 hits, 49 walks, struck out 56 and had a rather high 4.44 ERA, however, his performance earned him a promotion to AAA for the season.
In 26 games for the Pacific Coast League's last-place Sacramento Solons, he led the league in complete games with eleven. In 180 innings, he struck out 104, but gave up 215 hits, fifty of which were home runs. As a result, he had an inflated 6.00 ERA.
Milwaukee Brewers.
The fifth place Milwaukee Brewers needed pitching in , and Hausman made the team. He made his major league debut in relief in a 10-1 loss to the New York Yankees on April 26. On May 27, Hausman entered a game against the Chicago White Sox in relief of Ed Sprague in the second inning with the Brewers already down 3-0. As soon as Hausman entered the game, an error by Robin Yount at shortstop made the score 4-0. From there, Hausman pitched 6.2 innings, and allowed three runs. The Brewers, meanwhile, battered Wilbur Wood for eight runs to earn Hausman his first major league victory.
Hausman's first major league start was cut short by a back injury. He made his second start in the first game of a July 6 doubleheader with the Detroit Tigers. He faced four batters without recording an out. Undeterred, he pitched seven innings in the second game.
His record was 3-2 with a 3.92 ERA when he was moved into the starting rotation. On July 27, Hausman pitched eight innings of scoreless ball against the Baltimore Orioles, and was in line for his first win as a starting pitcher when he handed the ball to relief pitcher Tom Murphy with a 6-0 lead. The bullpen imploded for six runs, and Hausman ended up with a no decision. Facing the O's again in his next start, Hausman pitched his first career complete game, and lost, 3-1. Hausman would end up going 0-4 with a 4.66 ERA in August. His recurring back injury forced the Brewers to shut him down for the last month of the season.
In , Hausman appeared in only three games with the Brewers, all in relief. In three innings of work, he gave up three hits, three walks and two earned runs. The rest of the year was spent with the AAA Spokane Indians who finished last in the PCL West. He played in 22 games (111 innings) and allowed 135 hits and 36 walks for an ERA of 5.68. Hausman struck out forty and was on their suspended list from August 14 to September 7.
In , Hausman remained the whole year at Spokane where he led the PCL in games started with 30. He completed a career high 207 innings, had a 13–6 record for the second place team. Hausman gave up 251 hits, 55 walks with a 4.22 ERA. He struck out 88. He declared as a free agent after the season.
New York Mets.
On, November 21, 1977, Hausman signed as a free agent with the New York Mets. Despite being the franchise's first free agent signing, Hausman began the season in triple A with the Tidewater Tides. In ten starts, Hausman went 5-2 with a 1.22 ERA to quickly earn a call up to New York, however, a stint on the DL from May 25 to June 17 delayed his Mets debut until July 7. He earned his first win as a starter on July 17 against the Atlanta Braves, and also collected his first career run batted in. His finest start of the season was his third start, also against the Braves. He pitched eight innings of shutout ball before handing the ball to Mets closer Skip Lockwood. All told, Hausman went 3-3 with a 4.70 ERA.
Hausman, again, began the season in AAA. For Tidewater (12 g, 72 inn), Hausman gave up 75 hits, 23 walks and struck out 27. His ERA was at 4.50. When he came up in June, he split his time between starting and relief roles, and lost all four of his first four decisions despite a relatively low 2.84 ERA. He earned his first career save on July 8 against the San Diego Padres, pitching 3.1 innings of one hit ball. His first win of the season was a complete game victory over Vida Blue and the San Francisco Giants six days later. He was lifted early in his July 31 start against the Pittsburgh Pirates when he hurt his lower back covering first on a ground ball. After sitting out the entire month of August, he wouldn't earn a second win until September 26 against the Chicago Cubs. For the season, he went 2-6 with two saves and a 2.75 ERA.
Hausman began the season as a starter. After falling to 0-1 with a 6.75 ERA, he was moved into a "mop up duty" role in the bullpen, but an exceptional month of June changed that. His first win of the season came on June 6 against the Pirates. He entered in the fifth inning, and pitched 4.2 innings of scoreless ball. His next win came in his next appearance, when he pitched five innings of shutout ball against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Perhaps his finest performance came on June 27, when he earned his only save on the season by pitching three innings of no hit ball against the eventual World Series champion Philadelphia Phillies.
The strong pitching continued into July. He pitched five innings, and allowed one unearned run to pick up his fourth win of the season against the Montreal Expos on July 3. From June 6 through July 18, Hausman was 4-1 with a 0.94 ERA. For the season, he went 6-5 with a 3.98 ERA. He pitched a career high 122 innings, and gave up 125 hits and only 26 walks while striking out 53.
Slowed by an elbow injury in , he made only 20 relief appearances for the Mets. In 33 innings, he allowed 28 hits and 7 walks with 13 strike outs and an ERA of 2.18. The injuries continued in with both shoulder and elbow problems. He pitched part of the year for Tidewater (9.00 ERA) and was in 21 games for the Mets (37 inn, 44 hits, 6 walks, 16 so, 4.42 ERA, .295 OBA). On September 10, he was reunited with his former manager Joe Torre, when he was traded to the first place Braves for Carlos Diaz. During their stretch run, he appeared in 3 games (4 innings) for his new club, allowing 6 hits and 4 walks.
Late career.
Hausman signed with the Pirates during Spring training . He appeared in four games with the Pacific Coast League's Hawaii Islanders. going 2–1 with a 1.59 ERA. He was out of baseball in , but attempted a comeback in the PCL for the Padres' affiliate, the Las Vegas Stars, and the Dodgers' affiliate, the Albuquerque Dukes in . His record was 3–4 with a 5.25 ERA.
Death.
Hausman died on January 16, 2019.

American upper class

The American upper class is a social group within the United States consisting of people who have the highest social rank, due to economic wealth, lineage, and typically educational attainment. The American upper class is estimated to be the richest 1% of the population.
The American upper class is distinguished from the rest of the population because its primary source of income consists of assets, investments, and capital gains rather than wages and salaries. Its members include owners of large private companies, heirs to fortunes, and top executives of certain publicly traded corporations (more importantly, critically vital large scale companies and corporations).
Definitions.
The American upper class is seen by some as simply being composed of the wealthiest individuals and families in the country. The American upper class can be broken down into two groups: people of substantial means with a history of family wealth going back a century or more (called "old money") and families who have acquired their wealth more recently (e.g. fewer than 100 years), sometimes referred to as "new money".
The main distinguishing feature of this class, which includes an estimated 1% of the population, is the source of income. While the vast majority of people and households derive their income from wages or salaries, those in the upper class derive their primary income from business profits, investments, and capital gains. Estimates for the size of this group commonly vary from 1% to 2%, based on wealth.
Many heirs to fortunes, top business executives such as CEOs, owners of large private companies, successful venture capitalists, and celebrities may be considered members of the upper class.
Upper class versus rich.
In some academic models, the rich are considered to constitute 5% of U.S. households, and their wealth is largely in the form of financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and private businesses. Other contemporary sociologists, such as Dennis Gilbert, argue that this group is not part of the upper class but rather part of the upper middle class, as its standard of living is largely derived from occupation-generated income and its affluence falls far short of that attained by the top percentile. In a 2015 CNBC survey of the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans, 44% described themselves as middle class and 40% as upper middle class. Some surveys have indicated that as many as 6% of Americans identify as "upper class."
Sociologist Leonard Beeghley considers total wealth to be the only significant distinguishing feature of this class and refers to the upper class simply as "the rich." Beeghley divides "the rich" into two sub-groups: the rich and the super-rich. The super-rich, according to Beeghley, are those able to live off their wealth without depending on occupation-derived income. This demographic constitutes roughly 1% of American households. Beeghley's definition of the super-rich is congruent with the definition of upper class used by most other sociologists.
Power and influence.
Sociologists such as W. Lloyd Warner, William Thompson, and Joseph Hickey recognize prestige differences among members of the upper class. Established families, prominent professionals, and politicians may be deemed to have more prestige than some entertainment celebrities; national celebrities, in turn, may have more prestige than members of local elites. However, sociologists argue that all members of the upper class have great wealth and influence, and derive most of their income from assets rather than income.
In 1998, Bob Herbert of "The New York Times" referred to modern American plutocrats as "The Donor Class", referring to political donations. In 2015, the "New York Times" carried a list of top donors to political campaigns. Herbert had noted that it was "a tiny group – just one-quarter of 1 percent of the population – and it is not representative of the rest of the nation. But its money buys plenty of access."
Theories regarding social class.
Functional theorists in sociology assert that the existence of social classes is necessary to ensure that only the most qualified persons acquire positions of power, and to enable all persons to fulfill their occupational duties to the greatest extent of their ability. Notably, this view does not address wealth, which plays an important role in allocating status and power. According to this theory, to ensure that important and complex tasks are handled by qualified and motivated personnel, society attaches incentives such as income and prestige to those positions. The more scarce that qualified applicants are and the more essential the given task is, the larger the incentive will be. Income and prestige—which are often used to indicate a person's social class—are incentives given to that person for meeting all qualifications to complete an important task that is of high standing in society due to its functional value.
As mentioned above, income is one of the most prominent features of social class, but is not necessarily one of its causes. In other words, income does not determine the status of an individual or household, but rather reflects that status. Income and prestige are the incentives created to fill positions with the most qualified and motivated personnel possible.
Sociologist William Lloyd Warner also asserts the existence of class markers:
Warner asserts that social class is as old as civilization itself and has been present in nearly every society from before the Roman Empire, through medieval times, and to the modern-day United States. He believes that complex societies such as the United States need an equally complex social hierarchy.
Assortative mating in humans has been widely observed and studied. It includes the tendency of humans to prefer to mate within their socio-economic peers, that is, those with similar social standing, job prestige, educational attainment, or economic background as they themselves. This tendency has always been present in society: there was no historical area when most of the individuals preferred to sort, and had actually sorted, negatively into couples or matched randomly along these traits.
Education.
Members of the upper class in American society are commonly distinguished by their extensive education and affiliations with prestigious institutions, such as the Ivy League and other private universities. Often hailing from wealthy backgrounds, these individuals benefit from access to elite educational opportunities that serve as key mechanisms for maintaining their socioeconomic status across generations.
Upper-class parents prioritize securing their children's positions within their social stratum, frequently by enrolling them in renowned primary schools followed by prestigious middle and high schools. As they progress in their academic journeys, many aspire to attend elite private colleges, with such institutions representing the pinnacle of academic achievement and social prestige. Additionally upper class members may join exclusive clubs, secret societies, or select fraternities and sororities.
Religion.
The spectrum of wealth accumulation in the United States is characterized by its diversity, mirroring the nation's intricate array of religious beliefs and customs. While individuals from diverse religious backgrounds have attained affluence, discernible trends emerge concerning the religious affiliations prevalent among the affluent segment of the population.
Within the American upper class, Mainline Protestantism stands out prominently in terms of religious representation. Among its various denominations, Episcopalians and Presbyterians notably feature prominently among the affluent segment of society. These denominations, steeped in historical connections to prosperous communities and esteemed institutions, have fostered networks of privilege and influence that permeate economic realms. In terms of social status, in the 1940s survey data showed the "top rank" comprised Christian Scientists, Episcopalians, Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Jews. In the 1980s the top ranked were Unitarians, Jews, Episcopalians, Presbyterians and United Church of Christ (Congregationalists). In terms of occupation, according to sociologist Andrew Greeley, in the 1960s and 1970s, "Jews, Episcopalians and Presbyterians represent the elite of non-Spanish white Americans; Methodists, Catholics and Lutherans represent the middle class; and Baptists are the less successful."
Episcopalians frequently originate from socioeconomically advantaged backgrounds and have traditionally occupied leadership roles in many spheres such as business, academia, high culture, and politics. Their focus on education, traditional values, and social obligation has fostered a climate of achievement and charitable giving within Episcopal circles, enabling the transmission and endurance of affluence through successive generations.
Bradley J. Longfield argues, "Presbyterians, as articulate and educated members of the dominant culture in America, were significant shapers of that culture for generations." Presbyterians have exerted significant influence on American economic and cultural landscapes, leveraging their cohesive community dynamics and shared values to advance financial prosperity. Rooted in Calvinist principles emphasizing diligence, discipline, and stewardship, Presbyterian congregations have cultivated an ethos of entrepreneurship and accomplishment congruent with the pursuit of material success in the United States.
Apart from Mainline Protestantism, various religious communities have made notable contributions to the economic landscape of the United States. Jewish-Americans, in particular, have demonstrated exceptional achievements in finance, law, and entertainment throughout history. Their cultural emphasis on education, entrepreneurship, and communal solidarity has played a pivotal role in their pursuit of financial prosperity and success in diverse sectors of American society.
Similarly, Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, and Sikh communities have witnessed significant instances of wealth accumulation and entrepreneurial success, underscoring the rich diversity and vibrancy of America's religious landscape. Members of these communities, ranging from pioneering Silicon Valley innovators to influential figures in Wall Street finance, have left an indelible imprint on the American economy.
Empirical distribution of income.
One 2009 empirical analysis analyzed an estimated 15–27% of the individuals in the top 0.1% of adjusted gross income (AGI), including top executives, asset managers, law firm partners, professional athletes and celebrities, and highly compensated employees of investment banks. Among other results, the analysis found that individuals in the financial (Wall Street) sector constitute a greater percent of the top income earners in the United States than individuals from the non-financial sector, after adjusting for the relative sizes of the sectors.
Statistics.
There are 3,144 counties and county-equivalents in the United States. The 2020 United States census provided data on the 100 counties with the highest median household income. Virginia has the most counties in the top 100 with 18 followed by California with 11; Maryland with 10; New Jersey with nine; New York and Texas with six each; Illinois with five; Colorado, Massachusetts, and Minnesota with four each; Ohio and Pennsylvania with three each; Georgia, Indiana, Utah, and Washington with two each; and Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Wisconsin with one each.

Shi Yongxin

Shi Yongxin (), born Liu Yingcheng (), is a Chinese Buddhist monk who served as abbot of the Shaolin Temple from 1999 to 2025. He is known for his role in commercializing the temple and for controversies surrounding his personal life.
Biography.
Shi was born in Yingshang County, Anhui, China. At the request of his parents, he entered monastic life at the Shaolin Temple at the age of 16 and received full ordination in 1984. At 22, following studies at various Buddhist colleges, he was designated successor to the abbacy of Shaolin Temple. A Dharma assembly was held at the temple from 19 to 20 August 1999, to mark his inauguration as abbot. Shi has served as Chairman of the Henan Province Buddhist Association, Vice-chairman of the Buddhist Association of China, and a delegate to the Ninth through Twelfth sessions of the National People's Congress. His responsibilities were both scholarly and ecclesiastical, including presiding over major ceremonies at the Shaolin Temple.
Controversies.
Commercialization of the Shaolin Temple.
Shi has drawn controversy for commercializing the Shaolin Temple and managing it like a business, earning him the nickname "CEO Monk." He has been criticized for accepting lavish gifts, promoting the temple through paid advertisements, and implementing fees for admission and incense burning. Additionally, in 2001, he faced criticism for approving the demolition of the surrounding village to support the temple's bid for UNESCO World Heritage status. In November 2009, the official website of the Shaolin Temple was hacked twice. In the first incident, a calligraphic message reading "Shaolin evildoer Shi Yongxin, go to hell" was posted. In the second, hackers uploaded a letter purportedly written by Shi Yongxin, in which he appeared to apologize for leading a materialistic lifestyle and commercializing the temple. The Shaolin Temple attracts an estimated 3 to 5 million visitors annually, generating over 300 million RMB each year from entrance fees and incense offerings alone. As of 2023, Shi Yongxin controls 18 companies. The temple has registered more than 700 trademarks across categories such as food, lodging, and jewelry. Shaolin cultural centers operate in over 50 countries and regions worldwide, with a global following of more than 3 million international disciples.
Shi has defended his actions by arguing that commercialization is a modern means to promote and preserve traditional Shaolin culture: "Commercialization or industrialization, whatever term you use it, is a path leading up to the truth of Zen. My vision is that Shaolin will eventually become a source of consolidating Chinese people's confidence and wisdom."
Criminal allegations.
In 2011, a rumor alleging that Shi had been arrested for soliciting prostitution circulated widely online. On 8 May of that year, the Shaolin Temple filed a report with local authorities, requesting an investigation into the allegedly defamatory claims.
On 26 July 2015, an anonymous post titled "Shaolin Abbot Shi Yongxin, This Big Tiger—Who Will Supervise?" surfaced online. The author, with the pseudonym "Shi Zhengyi," accused the abbot of holding dual household registrations ("hukou") and government identifications, and having been excommunicated twice for theft by previous abbots Xingzheng in 1987 and Dechan in 1988—actions approved by the Buddhist Association of China in 1988—thereby rendering his succession to the abbacy illegitimate. The post also alleged that Shi raped a Buddhist nun, maintained multiple mistresses, and had fathered two daughters: Liu Mengya, with Guan Lili in the early 1990s, and Han Jia'en (b. 2009), with a nun named Shi Yanjie (born Han Mingjun). The Shaolin Temple denied the allegations the following day. On 30 July, a joint statement of 29 Shaolin monks alleged that the anonymous poster "Shi Zhengyi" was Shi Yanlu, the former head of the temple's martial monks. While Shi Yanlu denied being the author of the online post, he publicly supported its contents. Shi Yongxin was scheduled to lead a delegation to Thailand on 2 August, but his trip was canceled due to an ongoing investigation launched by the Dengfeng Religious Affairs Bureau. On 8 August, Shi Yanlu and five associates formally submitted a written report to the National Religious Affairs Administration, largely reiterating the online allegations. The case was subsequently referred to the Henan Religious Affairs Bureau, which concluded in November 2015 that the accusations were unfounded.
On 27 July 2025, the Shaolin Temple announced that Shi Yongxin was under investigation for alleged criminal misconduct, including the embezzlement and misappropriation of temple funds and assets. He was also accused of serious violations of Buddhist monastic discipline, including maintaining improper relationships with multiple women and fathering illegitimate children. The following day, the Buddhist Association of China announced the revocation of his monastic credentials upon recommendation of the Henan Provincial Buddhist Association. On 29 July, was transferred from his post as abbot of the White Horse Temple to replace Shi Yongxin at the Shaolin Temple.

The Passing Zone

The Passing Zone is an American comedy-juggling duo comprising Jon Wee and Owen Morse. Wee, originally from Minnesota, and Morse, a California native, met at a juggling convention in northern California in 1986 and decided two years later to team up. Since then, the Passing Zone has won 18 gold medals from the International Jugglers' Association (IJA) and holds five Guinness World Records.
The Passing Zone was one of ten finalists out of hundreds of acts to perform during the debut season of NBC's "America's Got Talent" where, despite finishing as "the highest rated comedy act," Wee and Morse "lost one million dollars to Bianca Ryan." They also appeared during the 11th Season of NBC's "America's Got Talent", where they were eliminated in the semifinals. They have entertained as part of the Royal Variety Performance for England's Prince Charles—sharing the bill with Tony Bennett and the cast of "Riverdance", among others—and also have been "guest performers" at the White House. The Passing Zone performs regularly for some of the top corporations in the United States while "inspiring groups to be better teams."
Biography.
Jonathan Wee is one of three children of David and Karen Wee and was raised in Northfield, Minnesota. A performer since age 14, Wee preferred to juggle with partners. He performed with two childhood friends, calling themselves Three of Clubs, and worked the Minnesota Renaissance Fair. Wee admits that they "were really pretty bad," although in the end he figures that fair officials "thought, 'we'll let them in. Owen Morse, of Tustin, California, began performing in high school, crafted a 15-minute-long, sports-themed routine set to music, and eventually earned work through an agency in Hollywood, playing the Sawdust Festival in Laguna Beach while in high school and working at Disneyland while in college.
A mutual friend introduced Wee and Morse at a jugglers' convention in San Jose, California, and they spent the next year corresponding regularly. The two met again at the IJA convention in Akron, Ohio, and decided to pair up in 1988 for the Teams Championships in Denver, Colorado, where they took the silver medal only "two weeks after their first performance together." The following year, they took the gold.
Wee elected to move to southern California after he graduated from Luther College that spring. Morse graduated one year later from University of California, Irvine. By the end of 2006, Morse was living in Tustin with his wife and their two daughters while Wee lived in Hermosa Beach with his wife and their son and daughter.
Career.
Wee and Morse spent several years honing their act at comedy clubs, trade shows and colleges. They were the first jugglers documented to pass eleven clubs between them. In addition, their performances have been seen as innovative, having created such routines as "The Chainsaw Ballet" (performed to "The Blue Danube") and "people juggling" (featuring three audience members hanging from special rigging). All in all the pair owns five Guinness World Records and has collected 18 gold medals from the IJA.
The Passing Zone was among the varied acts taking part in the Royal Variety Performance at Dominion Theatre in 1994 for England's Prince Charles, who called their act "very clever, although I'm glad I wasn't sitting in the front row!" Wee and Morse have performed during half-time shows at NBA, CBA and NCAA sporting events. They have been featured on such television programs as "Comic Strip Live", "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" (in 1990 and 1991), "Donny &amp; Marie" and "". They were hired as juggling stand-ins for Raúl Juliá and Christopher Lloyd in "The Addams Family" (1991), performing "in the climactic Mamushka dagger-passing scene." In 2005, the pair took part in Penn Jillette's comedy documentary "The Aristocrats", and appeared as juggling chefs in an episode of "Hell's Kitchen".
Wee and Morse have been "guest performers" at the White House. They also were hired to provide guest commentary for ESPN's coverage of the World Juggling Federation competitions.
The men actively market their act to corporate events, where they demonstrate the concept of teamwork by bringing executives and employees to the stage and by using the company's products and logos as part of their act. They have performed to stress the value of teamwork for such diverse organizations as Boeing, Deloitte and Touche, Hewlett-Packard, Mattel and the United States Army.
"America's Got Talent", 2006.
The Passing Zone made its first appearance during season 1 of "America's Got Talent", as part of the Chicago auditions aired on July 5, 2006. Wee bounced a rubber (prop) bowling ball off of Morse's face ("to make sure you're paying attention"), then climbed onto Morse's shoulders while Morse balanced on a Rola Bola long enough for the duo to juggle a total of six flaming torches in unison. The judges' assessments were not unanimous; David Hasselhoff rejected them ("That's the act?!") while Brandy and Piers Morgan wanted to see more.
Wee and Morse replicated "people juggling" for the semi-finals on August 2, 2006, winning over the audience and Hasselhoff ("I think I have just gotten out of 'I Hate Jugglers Anonymous'. I thought that was fantastic!"). One of ten acts to return for the finals two weeks later, The Passing Zone brought Hasselhoff to the stage and, as all three men wore torches atop construction helmets (and with Hasselhoff holding four spinning plates), Wee and Morse passed sickles back and forth around him. Though Morgan thought they had done well, the act finished in the bottom five when the results of the viewers' vote were announced on August 17, 2006.
"America's Got Talent", 2016.
The Passing Zone auditioned for season 11 of "America's Got Talent" in an episode broadcast on July 5, 2016. Wee and Morse asked judge Howie Mandel to lie on the stage; Morse straddled Mandel while juggling a mouse trap, a flaming plunger, and a taser. Wee then jumped over Morse while continuing to juggle the items. The act was put through to the Judges Cuts round, where their knife-throwing routine ended with Mandel in a dunk tank and earned them a trip to the live shows.
Wee and Morse returned to "people juggling" for their next performance, this time juggling judges Mandel, Heidi Klum, and Mel B. They were eliminated from the competition the following night. They returned to the competition as the judges' wild card act, set to appear during the show's second semi-final week. As promised, their act included judge Simon Cowell and "more risk of death" with numerous flaming torches. They were eliminated by popular vote.

Spain national cricket team

The Spanish national cricket team is the team that represents Spain in international cricket. They became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1992 and an associate member in 2017. They made their international debut in the ECC Trophy in 2001, finishing in 6th place. They played in the tournament again in 2001, this time finishing seventh. In the equivalent tournament in 2005, the European Affiliates Championship, they put in a much improved performance to finish third, just missing out on promotion to Division Two of the European Championship. They played in Division Three of that tournament in 2007 and again in 2009.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Spain and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 were to have the T20I status.
History.
Cricket is first recorded as being played in Spain in the year 1809 by soldiers of General Lord Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington). During the Peninsular War the soldiers played the game in and around Ciudad Rodrigo, Lugo and Orense. There are many records of the game being played by visiting British land and sea forces, either among themselves or against local British expatriate communities.
The game entered a new era in Spain with the founding of Madrid Cricket Club in 1975. It was based at first on British and Indian players, but soon West Indian and Spanish members joined.
In June 1989, a National Executive Committee was formed and the first steps were taken to unify all of the cricket playing clubs in Spain.
First International Tournament (ECC Trophy/ICC Europe Championships).
Spain played their first tournament in 2001 in Austria. It was the ECC Trophy 2001. They also played their first match of their international cricket history in that tournament. They were in the Seebern Group amongst 2 groups. In their group there were Portugal, Malta, Finland and Sweden. Every match of the tournament was 35 overs. 
They played their first match on13 August 2001 at the Seebarn Cricket Centre No 1 Ground, Lower Austria against Portugal. After winning the toss Portugal came down to bat and scored 229/6 in 35 overs. Opener Nadeem Butt scored 69. But due to their slow overrate Spain could play 32 overs. In 32 overs Portugal made 166/7. G Howe made 40 the highest score of Spain's innings. Portuguese bowler Bagvanadaia made 3/19 in 4 overs. So Spain lost their 1st international match against Portugal by 63 runs. 
Spain's next matches was against Finland. It was on 14 August 2001 at Seebarn Cricket Centre No. 2 Ground, Lower Austria. After winning toss Spain came down to bat. They made 222/3 in 35 overs. Batsman G Howe made 103 which was the highest of Spain's innings. Finish bowler Scott Thurling took 2/36 in 7 overs. In bowling Spain smashed their opponent Finland. Finland could make 141/9 in 35 overs. Scott Thurling made highest 43 in Finland's innings. G Howe took 3/29 in 7 overs. Spain got a victory of 81 runs and got their first win in international cricket.
2018–present.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Spain and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have been full T20I.
Spain played its first ever T20I against Malta on 29 March 2019, during the 2019 Spain Triangular T20I Series. The match was played at La Manga Club, Murcia, Spain.

Wolfgang Leonhard

Wolfgang Leonhard (16 April 1921 – 17 August 2014) was a German political author and historian of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic and Communism. A German Communist whose family had fled Hitler's Germany and who was educated in the Soviet Union, after World War II Leonhard became one of the founders and leaders of the German Democratic Republic until he became disillusioned and fled in 1949, first defecting to Yugoslavia and then moving to West Germany in 1950 and later to the United Kingdom. In 1956 he moved to the United States, where he was a popular and influential professor at Yale University from 1966 to 1987, teaching the history of communism and the Soviet Union, topics about which he wrote several books. After the Cold War ended, he returned to Germany.
Biography.
Early life.
Wolfgang (originally Vladimir) Leonhard was born in Vienna as the son of writers and Rudolf Leonhard. His mother was an active Communist and had been a close friend of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, the German Communist leaders. At the time of Wolfgang's birth, however, his parents were already divorced, and his mother had married the Soviet ambassador to Austria, Mieczysław Broński, under Soviet law. Susanne Leonhard worked as head of the press department of the embassy.
From 1931, Susanne Leonhard and her son lived in the "Artists' Colony" in Wilmersdorf, Berlin, the home of many left-wing intellectuals. Wolfgang attended Karl Marx Grammar School and joined the youth organization of the Communist Party of Germany, the "Young Pioneers". As things grew more dangerous in Berlin, he was sent to Landschulheim Herrlingen, a private boarding school, in 1932.
After Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Susanne Leonhard sent her son to a boarding school in Sweden. She visited him there in 1935, but during her visit, her leftist group in Germany was exposed and she could not go back to Germany. She was not allowed to stay in Sweden either, so she had her 13-year-old son choose between exile in England and exile in the Soviet Union. He chose the Soviet Union.
In the Soviet Union.
From 1935 to 1937, Leonhard attended Karl Liebknecht School in Moscow, a school for the children of German and Austrian Communist. A special children's home (Children's Home No. 6) had been established in Moscow for Austrian and German orphans of fascism; Leonhard lived there from September 1936 to August 1939, when it was closed a week after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, following months of pressure after a number of residents were arrested in the so-called Hitler Youth Conspiracy. Afterwards Leonhard enrolled as a student at the Moscow Institute for Foreign Languages.
1936 was the beginning of The Great Purge, a period of arbitrary arrests and trials in the Soviet Union. Leonhard's mother was arrested by the secret police, NKVD, in October 1936, and had to do forced labour for the next 12 years, mainly in the camp of Vorkuta (see Gulag). With the help of Wilhelm Pieck, later President of the German Democratic Republic, Leonhard achieved her release in 1948.
After the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 the Germans there were deported to certain areas mainly in the southeast, and Leonhard had to go to Karaganda but was able to continue his teacher training. A year later he was sent to the International Lenin School, the Comintern school that had moved from Moscow to Ufa during the invasion. Some of his teachers and fellow students there were to be found in leading positions after 1945, such as Paul Wandel, Heinz Hoffmann and Markus Wolf in the GDR and Jakub Berman in Poland. The eldest son of Yugoslav partisan leader Josip Broz Tito, Zarko, also attended the Comintern school at the time.
Leonhard's final exams at the Comintern school in the summer of 1943 coincided with the dissolution of the Comintern and the closure of the school. He was now employed by the "National Committee for a Free Germany", an organization of prisoners of war and expatriates. First he worked for its weekly newspaper "Free Germany", whose editor-in-chief was Rudolf Herrnstadt.
Anton Ackermann, one of the leaders of the "National Committee", made Leonhard an announcer at the Committee's radio station, "Radio Free Germany".
In East Germany.
Leonhard was chosen as a member of one of the two groups of German communists who were the first to return to Germany as soon as the Red Army had reached German territory. Each group consisted of ten members. Leonhard was in the Ulbricht Group, led by Walter Ulbricht, later (from 1950 to 1971) Secretary-General of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany ("Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands", or SED). Their task was to organize the administration of the Soviet occupation zone. "It has to look democratic, but we must have control of everything," Ulbricht told them. Therefore, deputy mayors and chief constables as well as heads of personnel departments and departments of education had to be Communists. Other administrative jobs could go to people of a different political persuasion in order to gain support from as many groups as possible.
In the following years Leonhard continued to work for the Central Committee of the Communist Party, which became the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in April 1946 after the Social Democratic Party in the Soviet zone had been forced to merge with it. Among other things he was involved in journalism and political instruction. In September 1947 he became a lecturer in the history department of the party's college "Karl Marx".
Escape to Yugoslavia.
Like Anton Ackermann, Wolfgang Leonhard thought that the creation of a German socialist state would follow a more democratic pattern than the developments he had experienced in the Soviet Union. His first criticism and doubts about Stalinism came as early as in 1936, when his mother was arrested, but his basic belief in Marxism–Leninism persisted for years.
On April 16, 1948, Walter Ulbricht gave a five-hour speech at the SED college outlining the plans for the Soviet-occupied sector. He identified the SED as the future governing power and asserted that people should seek to reach their own goals through the state apparatus. This speech convinced Leonhard that Germany was not going to follow a different path to socialism, but would replicate the Soviet system. In March 1949, he fled to Yugoslavia via Czechoslovakia. Yugoslavia had been expelled from Cominform, the successor organization of Comintern under Soviet leadership, and was establishing its own totalitarian type of socialism.
When asked in January 1996 what would have happened to him had the East German government caught him during his escape to Yugoslavia, Leonhard said, "Oh, execution. Because I was a high ranking official. I was the first high ranking official escaping from East Germany who was trained in Moscow, in the Soviet Union."
In Yugoslavia, Leonhard was in charge of the German programmes of Belgrade Radio.
In the West.
From Yugoslavia, Wolfgang Leonhard then went on to West Germany, where he worked as a political writer and as an expert on Eastern Europe. He later said that it was then that he chose the focus of his life's work: "In West Germany I looked around and I decided my life I will devote to one question only, the Soviet Union... My only aim was from 1950 onwards to study what happened and will happen in the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc."
After his postgraduate studies at St Antony's College, Oxford University, from 1956 to 1958, and his work as a senior research fellow at the Institute for Russian Studies of Columbia University, in New York City, in 1963 and 1964, Leonhard became a professor at Yale University. 
Professor Leonhard taught Soviet history and the history of international Communism at Yale from 1966 to 1987. His popular lecture course on the history of the Soviet Union was one of the largest courses there in the 1980s, and was commonly referred to as "Wolfgang." One of Leonhard's students at Yale was the future president George W. Bush, who wrote that Leonhard's History of the Soviet Union was "one of my most memorable courses," and "an introduction to the struggle between tyranny and freedom, a battle that has held my attention for the rest of my life."
Leonhard was a visiting professor at the universities of Michigan at Ann Arbor in the United States; and Mainz, Trier, Kiel, Chemnitz, and Erfurt in both West Germany and the former East Germany. He delivered lectures in places including Tokyo, Bombay, Accra, Ghana, and Colombo, Sri Lanka. 
He was the author of numerous books and essays on Eastern Europe and Communism. His 1955 memoir, "Die Revolution entlässt ihre Kinder" ("Child of the Revolution"), was translated into many languages and was an international bestseller. 
In 1987, when West German President Richard von Weizsäcker visited the Soviet Union, Leonhard was able to return to that country for the first time since 1945. Afterwards he paid regular visits to Russia and other countries in Eastern Europe. He has also had meetings with a number of acquaintances from his life in Russia and East Germany. Several times he observed elections in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OECD).
Wolfgang Leonhard's wife, Elke Leonhard, was an SPD member of the "Bundestag", the German parliament, from 1990 to 2005.
Death.
Leonhard died on August 17, 2014, at a hospital in Daun, Germany, from a long illness at the age of 93.

Early life, career, and family.
Mathis was born in Baltimore, Maryland. At the age of sixteen, Jimmy piloted a single engine Cessna 172 solo from Ocean City, Maryland to Long Beach, California, becoming the youngest solo aviator ever to fly cross country. Although there had been previous claims by younger "pilots" that they were the youngest pilot to fly coast-to-coast, they were accompanied by licensed pilots/instructors because they were not legally old enough to fly an airplane solo and as "pilot in command". Jimmy Mathis made the flight, after over 100 hours of training, and with a Student Pilot Certificate in his pocket. Jimmy planned and coordinated his trip with his instructors, Harry Kraemer and David Moeslein.
He had no blanket, no pillow. Overnight stays were with aviation businesses and Aviation Safety Counselor Associates. However, when he arrived in Cahokia, Illinois things didn't work out so well, so he called his dad who said he could stay wherever he wanted. He crossed the Mississippi River and stayed at Adam's Mark hotel in St. Louis MO over a rainy 4 July weekend.
Currently Jimmy hosts a Saturday morning talk show on Baltimore radio station WBAL, AM-1090.
Marriage and family.
Currently Mathis lives in Baltimore County with his wife Christin Bethany Jones, social services counselor.
Professional life.
After graduating from Towson Catholic High School, Mathis completed a 2-year intern program with Sinclair Broadcasting's FOX 45 Television in Baltimore working in all facets of television news &amp; sports.
Subsequently he was hired by WBAL-TV - the NBC affiliate in Baltimore before moving to WTTG-TV - FOX 5 in Washington, D.C., where he covered news stories at the White House and the United States Congress.
In 2002 Mathis founded, Mathis Productions, Inc. and has produced a variety of programs ranging from reality, comedy and human interest

Summer (Wharton novel)

Summer is a novel by Edith Wharton, which was published in 1917 by Charles Scribner's Sons. While most novels by Edith Wharton dealt with New York's upper-class society, this is one of two novels by Wharton with rural settings. Its themes include social class, the role of women in society, destructive relationships, sexual awakening and the desire of its protagonist, named Charity Royall. The novel was controversial at the time of its publication and is one of the less famous among her novels because of its subject matter.
Synopsis.
At the start of the novel, young Charity Royall is bored with her life in the small town of North Dormer. She was born to poor parents from "up the mountain" who gave her up to the town's learned person, Lawyer Royall, but she still dreams of an even better and more exciting life outside of the town. She secures a job at North Dormer's library in an attempt to save up money so she can eventually leave the town and Mr. Royall's care. The widowed Mr. Royall makes an inappropriate advance toward Charity one night that she rebuffs but it irrevocably sours their relationship.
When she is 17, that exciting life finds her in the form of a visiting architect named Lucius Harney. Her first encounter with the charming young man is at the library and there is immediate chemistry between them. Soon, he finds himself boarding at Mr. Royall's house when his own living arrangements fall through.
Charity Royall finds herself attracted to Lucius and decides to become his companion as he explores the town. He is putting together a book on colonial houses and the two of them go around town together so he can inspect and sketch the houses as a part of his research for the book. Mr. Royall, who holds onto the idea of marrying Charity, notices the two of them growing close and immediately evicts Lucius from his house. Lucius leaves town and relocates to a nearby village.
Later on, Charity and Lucius visit Nettleton for the Fourth of July, where they kiss for the first time and Lucius gives Charity a brooch. Before they are finished with their outing, they run into Mr. Royall, who seems really drunk. Mr. Royall verbally attacks Charity, which causes her to feel intense shame and hence falls into Lucius's arms. After the day's events, Charity and Lucius grow even closer and have sex for the first time.
After this, the two lovers meet frequently at an abandoned house. Charity develops fear when she sees Lucius with Annabel Balch, a local society girl, at a social event. Lucius promises to meet Charity at their usual place but when she goes there, she meets Mr. Royall who confronts her. Lucius promises to marry Charity but excuses himself to move out of town for a while. Later, a person comes to tell Charity that Lucius went out of town with Annabel Balch, a local society girl. Charity writes a letter to Lucius in bitterness telling him to marry Annabel.
Immediately after these events, Charity begins feeling sick. A doctor confirms that she is pregnant. Charity does not have any money to pay for the check-up and therefore, she gives the doctor the brooch Lucius gave her as collateral. Upon reaching home, she receives a letter from Lucius that confirms that he is going to marry Annabel and that he is pleased she has given him her blessing to do so. This frustrates her until she decides to pack and go look for her long-lost mother in the mountains. However, it turns out to be too late because Charity's mother passes away before they can reunite.
While staying at the Mountain with her relatives, Charity observes the poverty that has stricken people living around the Mountain. From the experience she has in the Mountain, she vows she will do everything to ensure that her child does not grow in poverty. She therefore returns home, intending to become a prostitute to support her child. However, along the way, she meets again with Mr. Royall. Mr. Royall offers her a ride and they decide to marry. In the end, she writes a letter to Lucius telling him about her marriage and finally returns home to stay with her husband in North Dormer.
Major themes.
Coming-of-age.
The most notable theme in "Summer" is Charity's coming-of-age. In a very classic style, Charity grows from an immature woman who does not understand her world or realities into an adult who can make complex and difficult decisions. Charity's journey with her forbidden lover Lucius Harney helps her to grow and understand herself sexually. When Charity and Harney meet for the fourth of July the explosive imagery reflects the initial excitement, joy, and sense of control Charity receives from her relationship. Charity is able to explore herself and "The romance of this seemingly mismatched couple ‘breaks, or stretches, many conventions of romantic love stories and in the process creates a new picture." Though their relationship is short-lived Charity does not regret it, she is able to come to terms with her situation and keep her pregnancy. Her decision to marry Mr. Royall can also demonstrate her growth as though it is not ideal that a young woman in her position would not have had many other options. Though it may seem as if Charity is giving in to a worse situation, it actually demonstrates her maturity because she is willing to make personal sacrifices for herself and her child.
Adaptations.
An operatic adaptation of "Summer", with music by Stephen Paulus and a libretto by Joan Vail Thorne, was premiered by the Berkshire Opera Company in 1999.

Remington XP-100

The Remington XP-100 (from eXperimental Pistol number 100) is a bolt-action pistol produced by Remington Arms from 1963 to 1998. The XP-100 was one of the first handguns designed for long-range shooting and introduced the .221 Fireball and 6×45mm. The XP-100 was noted for its accuracy and is still viewed as competitive today in the sport of handgun varminting, which it helped create, as well as in metallic silhouette shooting.
Overview.
The XP-100 was based on Remington's short action bolt action carbine, the Remington Model 40X, which influenced the later Remington Model 600 rifle. The XP-100 was initially introduced with a barrel set into a nylon stock with an unusual center-mounted grip. Chambered in .222 Remington in early prototypes, the short barrel produced significant noise and muzzle flash. Subsequently, the case was shortened to reduce powder capacity to a volume more suited to the shorter barrel of a pistol. The resulting cartridge, the .221 Fireball, produced factory-loaded velocities of over 825 m/s (2,700 ft/s) from the short barrel, and accuracy rivaling the parent .222 Remington, one of the most accurate cartridges made.
All but the XP-100R model were single-shot designs, while the XP-100R had a small internal magazine (holding four rounds), similar to most bolt-action rifles. The R model - for "repeater" - was made 1991–1997 in .223 Rem., .250 Savage, 7mm-08 Rem., .308 Win., .35 Rem., and 350 Rem. Mag. It was reintroduced in 1998, this time without sights, in .223 Rem., .22-250 Rem., .260 Rem., and .35 Rem.
Self-proclaimed JFK assassin James Sutton aka James E Files claimed that he had shot U.S. president John F Kennedy from the grassy knoll with a Fireball XP-100. He added that the CIA had provided it to him, before its commercial release.
Model history.
The XP-100 went through a number of changes during its production run, and many variations were only available through the Remington Custom shop. The most significant changes in the later versions were to barrel length, which went to , and the grip location, which was moved to the rear of the stock. Stocks with a rear grip use standard Remington 700 triggers, while stocks with a center grip need a special trigger linkage system with a long transfer bar. The calibers changed; with the elimination of the original barrel, the reduced powder capacity was no longer such a requirement, and the chamberings switched to standard commercial rifle cartridges. By the time the XP-100 was canceled, it faced stiff competition from other bolt-action pistols such as the Savage Striker as well as the versatile Thompson Center Arms break-action Contender.
Current production.
The XP-100 action was used as the basis for a new single-shot rifle from Remington called the XR-100 Rangemaster.
While the XP-100 has disappeared from Remington's lineup (Remington is primarily a maker of rifles and shotguns), the .221 Fireball remains in production. The Model 700 rifle has been available since 2002 in a .221 Fireball chambering; while it lacks the velocity attainable with the vastly more popular .223 Remington, the short .221 Fireball delivers most of the performance with far less noise and flash.
Factory recall.
In 1979, XP-100 pistols and Remington Model 600 rifles were recalled because of a safety issue. It was impossible to unload the gun with the safety on because engaging the safety locked the bolt in place. Remington made a free modification available that allowed the bolt to open while the gun was on safe, allowing it to be unloaded without disengaging the safety.

Saenger Theatre (Pensacola, Florida)

The Saenger Theatre, also known as the Saenger Theater, is a historic theater in Pensacola, Florida. It is located at 118 South Palafox Place. On July 19, 1976, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
In 1989, the Saenger Theater was listed in "A Guide to Florida's Historic Architecture", published by the University of Florida Press.
History.
The theatre, often referred to as the "Grand Dame of Palafox" was first built in 1925 and was designed by architect Emile Weil in the style known as Spanish Baroque architecture. This style was selected due to the extensive Spanish history of the Pensacola area. Mr. Weil is also known for designing theaters in Mobile, Alabama, as well as New Orleans and Shreveport, both of Louisiana.
Construction began at 118 South Palafox and opened in 1925. The back of the theater uses bricks from the Pensacola Opera House, which stood at the corner of Jefferson and Government Streets, but was destroyed in the 1916 hurricane. The overall cost to build the Saenger was a total of $500,000 and was constructed by C.H. Turner Company, General Contractors.
The building not only featured a Robert Morton organ which currently is in reconstruction, but also 2,250 leather-backed seats, extravagant chandeliers and more than eight pounds of silver for its silver screen. The Saenger also boasted using "Dr. Mendenhall's new transvertical non-statical projectographic machine" as the projector.
Doors to the Saenger opened on April 2, 1925 to "The Star-Spangled Banner" followed by the "Dance of Old Seville," performed by a local dance class as well as a solo sung by yet another member of the community. The main event, which was Cecil B. DeMille's "The Ten Commandments," was finally shown which completed their sold-out grand opening day.
The Saenger was host to a variety of entertainment. In addition to silent motion pictures, and later motion pictures with sound, Vaudeville and Broadway shows were frequent favorites. Local entertainers were also invited to perform at the elite Saenger.
During World War II, the theater stayed open around the clock so that local citizens were able to watch newsreels at any time of the day, or night.
As the years passed, the illustrious theater began to fall out of favor due to competition with drive-ins, as well as other factors, and slowly fell into disrepair. Like so many other palatial movie houses, the Saenger sadly suffered from lack of interest.
1975 brought sadness as the doors to the once magnificent Saenger closed; however, it was not forgotten. The theater was donated to the City of Pensacola who, with the combined efforts of the University of West Florida, worked to restore her to her original majestic structure. In 1981, her first grand re-opening took place alongside a performance by "The Duke Ellington Orchestra," a well renowned jazz ensemble.
More recently, the theater underwent another renovation totaling over $15 million, exceeding original estimates by nearly $5 million. The latest renovation was to extend the stage as well as enlarge the dressing rooms. The seating was to become more spacious and comfortable as well. This second grand re-opening took place on March 26, 2009 to "Jesus Christ Superstar."
The structure remains at its original location on the Northeastern corner of South Palafox Place and East Intendencia Street and continues to provide a variety of entertainment as in its older days.

Headmaster (TV series)

Headmaster is an American half-hour television comedy-drama starring Andy Griffith and broadcast by CBS in the United States during the 1970–71 season.
Griffith returns to TV.
"Headmaster" marked the return to series television of Griffith, whose previous eponymous show had been one of CBS's major hits of the 1960s prior to his voluntary departure and a program which was still in production (as "Mayberry R.F.D."), when "Headmaster" was launched. Griffith had just signed a three-picture deal with Universal Pictures but was so disappointed with the first film in the contract, the rural comedy "Angel in My Pocket", that the two parties never made the other two films and he quickly returned to television.
With "Headmaster", Griffith fulfilled his desire to be cast in a television series as something other than a rural bumpkin dispensing folksy wisdom; here his character, Andy Thompson, was the headmaster of a prestigious California private school, the Concord School. His wife, Margaret (Claudette Nevins), was an English teacher. Two other cast members from "Angel in My Pocket" joined Griffith on "Headmaster": Parker Fennelly essentially reprised his role as a caretaker, here named Mr. Purdy, and Jerry Van Dyke played the role of athletic coach Jerry Brownell, Thompson's best friend. The show's theme song was performed by Linda Ronstadt.
Reception.
"Headmaster" was given a favorable time slot, Friday at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time, which had most recently been occupied by the hit sitcom "Hogan's Heroes"—but the program proved to be, by Griffith's own admission, "a very bad show" and was routinely beaten in the Nielsen ratings by both "The Partridge Family" on ABC and "The Name of the Game" on NBC. Production of the show was terminated after just 14 episodes, with the last first-run episode being broadcast January 1, 1971.
CBS (and sponsor Bristol-Myers) had spent some $3.5 million (roughly $25 million in 2022 money) to bring Andy Griffith back to television, and expected a whole season's worth of episodes, so "Headmaster" was hurriedly replaced by a new situation comedy, "The New Andy Griffith Show". The "new" program was practically a carbon copy of Griffith's old one, complete with a North Carolina setting and even guest appearances by "Andy Griffith Show" regulars Don Knotts, George Lindsey and Paul Hartman in the first episode. However, it met with little more success than "Headmaster", and it was cancelled after only ten airings, the last on May 21, 1971. (Also cashiered by CBS were former staples "The Beverly Hillbillies", "Green Acres" and "Hee-Haw", as part of the network's infamous "rural purge".) In June, "Headmaster" returned to the time slot in reruns for the summer, with the last repeat episode being aired on September 10, 1971.
Availability.
Viewing this series now is a rarity, despite the big-name lead. It is not on YouTube (other than its opening credits that are often posted due to featuring an otherwise-unreleased Linda Ronstadt performance), has had no DVD release, did not show up in syndication, and seldom is available with private collectors. One episode, "One for the Gipper," is archived in the collection at the Paley Center for Media.

New rave

New rave (also known as nü rave, nu rave or neu rave) is a microgenre of electronic music, commonly applied to a British-based music scene between 2005 and late 2008. Characterized by fast-paced electronica-influenced indie music that drew influences from 1980s Madchester and rave scenes. New rave later influenced the development of blog-related music genres such as bloghouse and blog rock. 
Notable acts include Klaxons, Trash Fashion, New Young Pony Club, Hadouken!, Late of the Pier and Shitdisco.
Etymology.
The term was coined by Klaxons founder Jamie Reynolds, who later declared they were not new rave, describing it as a "joke that's got out of hand", stating that: 
The genre is a play on the term "new wave" as well as being a "new" version of rave music. During the late 2000s, music blogs and press such as the "NME" and "the Guardian" further popularized the term. Though several artists associated with the scene rejected the label. 
Characteristics.
New Rave is characterized by the musical fusion of electronica with indie rock and dance-punk styles, described "the Guardian" as "an in-yer-face, DIY disco riposte to the sensitive indie rock touted by bands like Bloc Party." The aesthetics of the new rave scene are similar to those of the original rave scene, being mostly centred on psychedelic visual effects, glowsticks, neon lights. Artists often dress in extremely bright and fluorescent colored clothing. New rave has been defined more by the image and aesthetic of its bands and supporters, than by its music.
Bands such as The Sunshine Underground, CSS (Cansei de Ser Sexy), and Hot Chip have also been labeled as new rave, while M.I.A. has been described as "a new raver before it was old." Stylist Carri Mundane described it as funny, stating:
"Los Angeles Times" critic Margaret Wappler comments that the "minimalist dance-punk of LCD Soundsystem, the analog classicism of Simian Mobile Disco, the fanatical electro-thrash of Justice, the international amalgam of M.I.A., the agitated funk of !!! (Chk Chk Chk) and the art-schooled disco-sleaze of Cansei de Ser Sexy" contributed to the thriving 'new rave' dance scene, which led to a rediscovery of indie rockers, and a critical and intellectual revolution in dance music. Artists in the genre overlapped with other musical developments during the 2000s such as dance-punk, blog rock, and bloghouse. 
History.
Origins (2000s-2010s).
New rave originally emerged in the 2000s British electronic music scene, with artists such as Klaxons, Trash Fashion, New Young Pony Club, Hadouken!, Late of the Pier and Shitdisco. The term was coined by Klaxons founder Jamie Reynolds, who later declared they were not new rave, describing it as a "joke that's got out of hand." The "NME" later further popularised the term throughout 2006 and 2007, though later claiming in mid-2008 that "New Rave is over". The movement would later influence the contemporaneous bloghouse scene.
On October 13, 2006 music critic John Harris stated in "the Guardian" that the genre is nothing more than a "piss-poor supposed 'youthquake'" that will soon go out of fashion in the same way as rave. In reaction to the media overkill of the "genre", Klaxons banned the use of glowsticks at their gigs in April 2007.

Pat Delaney (Offaly hurler)

Pat Delaney (born 27 July 1954 in Kinnitty, County Offaly, Ireland) is a retired Irish hurling manager and former player. He played hurling with his local club Kinnitty and with the Offaly senior inter-county team in the 1970s and 1980s. Delaney later served as manager of the Laois senior hurling team from 2001 until 2002.
Playing career.
Club.
Delaney played his club hurling with his local Kinnitty club and enjoyed much success. He captured his first senior county title in 1978. The 1980s saw Kinnitty become one of the strongest club teams in the county. Delaney captured three county titles in-a-row in 1983, 1984 and 1985. These victories later saw Kinnitty play in the final of the Leinster club championship; however, Delaney's side were defeated on all three occasions.
Inter-county.
Delaney first came to prominence on the inter-county scene in the 1970s as a member of the Offaly minor and under-21 hurling teams. He had little success in these grades and little more was expected when he joined the senior grade as Offaly were down the pecking order in terms of hurling in Leinster. He made his senior debut in October 1974 when he lined out in the number 10 jersey against Antrim in the National Hurling League.
All changed in 1980 as Delaney's Offaly side came from nowhere to defeat All-Ireland champions Kilkenny in the Leinster final. It was Offaly's first-ever senior provincial title; however, only about 8,000 people were present at Croke Park to witness the historic occasion. Offaly's dream season came to an end in the All-Ireland semi-final as Galway defeated Delaney's side by two points in the first-ever meeting between these two bordering counties.
The following year Offaly proved that their victory wasn't a fluke as the team retained the Leinster title. This victory allowed Delaney's side to advance to their first-ever All-Ireland final. For the second year in-a-row Offaly faced Galway in the business end of the championship. The game was a close affair with Galway leading by six points at one stage. Galway failed to score for the last twenty-three minutes as Johnny Flaherty handpassed the winning goal for Offaly. It was the county's first All-Ireland title. Delaney's performance throughout the championship failed to earn him an All-Star award; however, he was named as the Texaco Hurler of the Year.
Offaly surrendered their Leinster crown to Kilkenny for the next two seasons; however, Delaney captured a third provincial medal in 1984. A defeat of Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final allowed Offaly to advance to the centenary year All-Ireland final. Cork provided the opposition on that occasion. It was the first-ever meeting between these two sides in a very special final at Semple Stadium in Thurles. The game was a close affair in the first-half; however, Cork captured goals in the second half to clinch the victory.
In 1985 Delaney captured a fourth Leinster title as Offaly retained their provincial dominance. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Offaly take on Galway for the third time of the 1980s. In an exciting game which saw a Joe Dooley goal being disallowed, Offaly captured the victory on a score line of 2-11 to 1-12. Not only had Delaney captured a second All-Ireland medal but he was also presented with an All-Star award. Delaney retired from inter-county hurling shortly after this victory.
Provincial.
Delaney also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition; however, he never won a Railway Cup medal.

Amour-propre

Amour-propre (; ) is a French term that can be variously translated as "self-love", "self-esteem", or "vanity". In philosophy, it is a term used by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who contrasts it with another kind of self-love, which he calls "amour de soi".
Concept.
According to Rousseau, the difference between the two is that "amour-propre" assumes that self-esteem can only be found by gaining the approval of others, whereas "amour de soi" involves one's feelings for oneself alone, without any intervening concerns about how one is seen by others. According to Rousseau, "amour de soi" is more primitive and is compatible with wholeness and happiness, while "amour-propre" is a form of self-love that arose only with the appearance of society and individuals' consequent ability to compare themselves with one another.
Rousseau thought that "amour-propre" was subject to corruption, thereby causing vice and misery. But in addition, by guiding us to seek others' approval and recognition, "amour-propre" can contribute positively to virtue.
The term "amour-propre" predates Rousseau and is found in the writings of Blaise Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, Pierre Nicole, Jacques Abbadie, and many others. Pascal detested self-love, self-esteem, ego, vanity as well perhaps, which are interchangeable terms for him, because it puts the self in the place of God. He suggested it was unfair that we are born with the desire to be loved by others, but unavoidable due to the consequence of the Fall, or original sin. Christianity was the only true remedy to this wretched state of man known as "amour-propre".

Simmons College of Kentucky

Simmons College of Kentucky, formerly known as Kentucky Normal Theological Institute, State University at Louisville, and later as Simmons Bible College, is a private, historically black college in Louisville, Kentucky. Founded in 1879, it is the nation's 107th HBCU and is accredited by the Association for Biblical Higher Education.
History.
Beginnings.
In August 1865, 12 Black Baptist churches met at Fifth Street Baptist Church in Louisville and organized the State Convention of Colored Baptist Churches in Kentucky, led by the pastor Henry Adams.
Because there was no place in the state for Blacks to obtain a college education, members of the Convention soon began discussing the need to create a school for the training of Negroes, many of whom were one generation removed from slavery. Having first given consideration to Frankfort as the home to the school, members of the Convention instead decided in 1869 to locate what would be known as the Kentucky Normal Theological Institute in Louisville.
It was not until 1879, however, that any definite steps were taken for the opening of the school. In November of that year the trustees of the Convention of Colored Baptist Church in Kentucky purchased of land on the corner of 7th &amp; Kentucky Street in Louisville that immediately served as the campus for the school.
Growth.
That same year, the school opened its doors under the direction of its first president, Rev. Elijah P. Marrs. After a brief one-year tenure, Rev. Marrs was succeeded by Dr. William J. Simmons. Simmons was an ex-slave who had greatly developed Howard University's teacher training programs. It was under the leadership of Dr. Simmons that the school would begin to flourish in such a way that it would eventually be renamed "Simmons University" in appreciation for his contributions. By 1893 the school had 159 students, and by 1900 it was offering professional degrees in nursing and law in cooperation with the University of Louisville.
During his 10-year tenure (1880–1890), the school became a full university and expanded its offerings to include liberal arts, college preparatory courses and medical, law, business, music, and theological departments. Additionally, the school was the home to competitive football, basketball, and baseball teams.
Simmons University continued to grow and prosper. In 1894, Simmons was succeeded by Charles L. Purce, who was president until his death in 1905. In 1907, the school, now called State University at Louisville entered into an affiliation agreement with the Louisville National Medical College to merge the two colleges. From 1908 until 1916, Rev. William T. Amiger served as president. In 1918, L. Charles Parrish became president of the school and improved the school's endowment and academic offerings. 
Decline.
The effects of the Great Depression found their way to the school. In 1930, the university was forced to sell its property due to a foreclosure on the mortgage. As a result, the school significantly scaled back its offerings. The University of Louisville purchased the bulk of the property for the site of Louisville Municipal College, U of L's black branch under segregation. As part of the purchase agreement, Simmons agreed to offer only religious instruction. In 1934, the University of Louisville purchased the remainder of the property, and Simmons relocated to 18th and Dumesnil. In 1982 the school was renamed Simmons Bible College to more adequately reflect its mission.
Renaissance.
In 2005, Dr. Kevin W. Cosby became the 13th president and subsequently changed the name of the school to Simmons College of Kentucky to reflect the school's mission to prepare Christians for ministry, while reinstating its initial mission of general education. In 2006, the school bought and moved back to the original campus. As of 2025, Simmons College had an increasing student enrollment, numbering 508 total students.
Academics.
Simmons College of Kentucky has developed four distinct educational programs, plus a commitment to a fifth program objective, with a focus on an academic, research-based, faith-based approach to community involvement, interaction, and development.
Non-degree programs include a certificate and a diploma in Christian Ministry Studies. Degree programs include the Bachelor of Theology, Bachelor of Arts, and associate degree. Since 2018 the Baptist Seminary of Kentucky has offered a Master of Divinity degree that can be earned entirely through classes taken on the Simmons College campus.
Simmons used to have a medical school but it closed in 1912 along with many bad medical schools cited by the Flexner Report. The medical school was originally founded as the Louisville National Medical College, which merged with Simmons in 1907.
Athletics.
The Simmons athletic teams are called the Falcons. The college is a member of the Division II level of the National Christian Collegiate Athletic Association (NCCAA) within the Mid-East Region. Simmons competes in three intercollegiate varsity sports: men and women's basketball, golf, and track and field.

Paninaro

Paninaro () was a social phenomenon in northern Italy during the 1980s that was characterized by an obsession with designer clothing and adherence to a lifestyle based on luxury consumption. 
It began in the Milanese metropolitan area, later spreading throughout continental Italy. The phenomenon led to the creation of magazines, films and television programs. Italian designer brands associated with "Paninaro" such as Stone Island, C.P. Company, Armani, and Fila were adopted by members of the football casual subculture in the United Kingdom.
History.
In the early 1980s the areas of Milan were frequented by groups of young people with their own rules and styles, such as metalheads or goths. Within this context, a group was established, which consisted predominantly of youngsters, who met at the local area of Piazza San Babila. This group defined its own vocabulary and created a trend based on the ostentation of very expensive designer garments. At the same time the fashion industry, having identified the new style, began to provide conforming garments and accessories at affordable prices. This phenomenon evolved initially in the sandwich bars and fast food restaurants of the center of Milan, then having spread throughout Italy, also spread abroad. The meeting places, sandwich shops and fast food restaurants, where quick meals could be eaten, therefore also determined their name.
The term derives, more specifically, from a bar in Milan, the "Al panino" bar, the usual haunt of the first group of "paninari", a group of boys who had coded their own jargon and their own clothing, based fundamentally on certain items of clothing and accessories of famous Italian or foreign brands. The phenomenon was born in the early eighties as an expression of the wave of reflux and disengagement that followed the turbulent and politicized previous decade. It rejected every form of social commitment and focussed on enjoying life without too many worries, conforming to the models of the American cinema of the period and to the advice of the commercials. advertising broadcast by commercial television stations in accordance with Reagan's hedonism. The new values that were affirmed are: "to function, to show that you are worthy, have a perfect body and image, be fashionable, make a career." Curiously, however, the "paninari" did not wear the typical clothing of American yuppies, the young in career, but typical clothing of the American working class such as Timberland boots, Levi's jeans, checkered shirts, boots and belts typical of woodcutters, but all strictly branded and very expensive.
The female counterpart of the "paninaro" was called a "sfitinzia" or "squinzia" which, according to the dictionaries, can be defined as a girl with a smirk, not very intelligent, flirtatious, often in fashion but according to the original meaning of 1986, written by Lina Sotis, who is a communist columnist, the squinzia is "The most widespread female category of the moment. They all had an imprinting, the television show of the second evening shows, clothes, tones of voice, lengths, courtships and stiletto heels: in the "squinzia" everything, except the brain, is exaggerated. The "squinzia" is the one that would like to catch more and pecks less, it is the eternal turkey and never taken."
The phenomenon quickly spread throughout Italy thanks to commercial television that exploited the phenomenon by amplifying the message and spreading the style. Its fame increased further due to a character played by the actor Enzo Braschi. He provided a stereotyped version of the "paninaro" in a successful TV show, "Drive In", which helped spread the fashion by codifying in turn some stylistic features to which many young people from all over Italy tried to conform. The success is such that even magazines dedicated to the phenomenon and addressed to the "paninari" like "Il Paninaro", with a circulation that reached 100,000 monthly copies, followed by "Wild Boys", inspired by the homonymous song of Duran Duran and sung by Braschi in his parody, "Zippo Panino", "Il Cucador" as well as the female versions like "Preppy" and "Sfitty".
The beginnings of the phenomenon were observed in Milan in a historical period of settlement of the Italian currency and of important signs of economic recovery, followed by relative well-being and greater availability of consumer goods. With the expansion of fashion, the formation of groups was natural, each with its own meeting point as a bar and a relative territory in the neighborhood; even very large groups, whose attendance could reach hundreds of people. On Saturday afternoons and evenings they were the meeting place for mass gatherings with subsequent transfer to one of the clubs that lent themselves well to exploit this phenomenon. Some of these groups, the most important ones, had very popular local leaders, usually with nicknames. The places of frequentation had a period of ephemeral life or changed name and company name in a short time, based on the trend and taste of the visitors.
A characteristic feature of the "paninari" was the food consumed in some fast-food restaurant chains, which began to spread throughout Italy in those years. In Rome, for example, the opening of the first McDonald's restaurant in 1986 in Piazza di Spagna was a memorable event for the "paninari" of the Italian capital. In Milan, by contrast, most of the various "panini" companies met in normal bars scattered throughout the city, and the dozens of "Burghy's" fast-food restaurants (with the exception of Piazza San Babila and Corso Re Vittorio Emanuele II), Wendy's and "King Burger" (not to be confused with Burger King which arrived in Italy only in 1999), the two so-called "second choices", were little frequented by the members of this youth subculture.
In a short time the "paninari" become a phenomenon of custom by acquiring a discreet reputation on a national level, above all thanks to the publication of some comics dedicated to the "paninari" and the character played by Enzo Braschi in "Drive In". In 1986 the Pet Shop Boys, following a visit to the center of Milan, recorded the single "Paninaro", which allowed the fashion to cross national borders. The protagonists of the video clip, shot in Milan, were some young men perfectly dressed according to the dictates of fashion.
The phenomenon initially did not have political connotations because social commitment was not in the interests of the groups that conformed to paninar aesthetics. Instead, there was a sort of class consciousness that led them to refuse contacts with other young people from different social backgrounds: the "paninari", at least in the original Milanese core which had the premises in the Piazza San Babila area, were the sons of the bourgeoisie medium-high class and therefore had monetary freedom that allowed the purchase of particularly expensive clothing. 
Subsequently, a political conscience of conservative inspiration began to arise, which led to conflicts with groups of different political identities. However, the phenomenon was brief and had effectively ended by the end of the decade; replaced by other subcultures that took note of the end of the period characterized by optimism and carefree. Fashion was exhausted in Milan at the end of the decade and in the rest of Italy shortly thereafter, replaced by other subcultures that reflected the end of a decade consumed under the banner of hedonism and superficiality.
In general it can be said that "paninari" fashion has been linked to the very young middle and high school students. At least, in Milan the "paninari" were almost totally absent from the universities. The header on the main headboard, "Paninaro", initially "I veri galli" (), accompanied the time of leaving the scene with "Pochi, duri, giusti" (). As with any past fashion, especially in Milan, revival evenings are held at discos, whose customers are now adult veterans, encouraged to dress in the fashions of the time.

Ger Fennelly

Ger Fennelly (born 22 January 1954) is an Irish retired hurler who played as a centre-forward and as a midfielder for the Kilkenny senior team.
Born in Piltown, County Kilkenny, Fennelly first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team before later joining the under-21 side. He joined the senior panel during the 1974 championship. Fennelly subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won three All-Ireland medals, six Leinster medals and three National Hurling League medals. The All-Ireland-winning captain of 1979, he was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions.
Fennelly was a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, however, he never won a Railway Cup medal. At club level he is a three-time All-Ireland medallist with Ballyhale Shamrocks. In addition to this Hennessy has also won four Leinster medals and nine championship medals.
His brothers, Michael, Kevin, Brendan, Liam and Seán Fennelly, Dermot and his nephews, Michael and Colin Fennelly, have all enjoyed All-Ireland success with Kilkenny.
Throughout his career Fennelly made 33 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1990 championship.
In retirement from playing Fennelly became involved in team management and coaching. He was a selector with the Kilkenny minor team that won the Leinster title in 1998.
Fennelly is widely regarded as one of the greatest club hurlers of his era. During his playing days he won one All-Star awards as well as being named at left wing-forward on the Club Hurling Silver Jubilee Team.
Playing career.
Club.
In 1978 Fennelly enjoyed his first success with the Ballyhale Shamrocks senior team. A 0-15 to 0-10 defeat of reigning champions Fenians secured a very first title for the club and a first championship medal for Fennelly. He later added a Leinster medal to his collection following a subsequent 1-13 to 1-6 defeat of Dublin champions Crumlin in the decider. On 25 March 1979 Ballyhale faced Blackrock in the All-Ireland decider. Two first-half Ray Cummins goals gave the Rockies a narrow lead while a fifth goal from Tom Lyons resulted in a narrow 5-7 to 5-5 defeat for Fennelly's side.
Fennelly added a second championship medal to his collection in 1979 as Ballyhale retained the title following a 3-12 to 1-6 defeat of Erin's Own following an earlier drawn game.
Ballyhale made it three-in-a-row in 1980 following a 3-13 to 1-10 replay defeat of Muckalee/Ballyfoyle Rovers. After collecting a third successive championship medal Fennelly later added a second Leinster medal to his collection as Coolderry were accounted for on a 3-10 to 1-8 score line. On 17 May 1981 Ballyhale faced a star-studded St. Finbarr's in the All-Ireland final. On that occasion all seven Fennelly brothers lined out in an exciting contest. The sides were level on five occasions during the opening thirty minutes, however, the Shamrocks had the edge after a Liam Fennelly goal. Jimmy Barry-Murphy pegged one back for the Barr's in the closing stages, however, a 1-15 to 1-11 victory secured an All-Ireland medal foe Fennelly.
Four-in-a-row proved beyond Ballyhale, however, Fennelly won a fourth championship medal in 1982 following a 3-10 to 2-4 defeat of James Stephens.
Fennelly missed Ballyhale's championship decider defeat of James Stephens in 1983, however, he was later restored to the starting fifteen and collected a third Leinster medal following a 3-6 to 0-9 defeat of Kinnitty. On 15 April 1984 Ballyhael faced Gort in the All-Ireland decider. A 59th-minute Dermot Fennelly goal secured a 1-10 apiece draw for the Shamrocks. The replay on 3 June 1984 was also a close affair. A first-half Fennelly goal paved the way for a 1-10 to 0-7 victory and a second All-Ireland medal for Fennelly.
In 1985 Fennelly won a fifth championship medal following a high-scoring 4-18 to 3-13 defeat of Glenmore.
After back-to-back defeats Ballyhale bounced back in 1988. A 2-15 to 0-4 trouncing of Thoamstown secured a sixth championship medal for Fennelly.
Ballyhale retained the title in 1989 following a narrow 2-11 to 1-13 defeat of Glenmore with Fennelly collecting a seventh championship medal. He later added a fourth Leinster medal to his collection as Cuala endured a 2-11 to 0-7 defeat in the provincial decider. On 17 March 1990 Ballyhale faced Ballybrown in the All-Ireland final. The Shamrocks were trailing by six points when a 24th-minute Fennelly goal brought them back into the game. The margin was four points at the interval, however, a second-half surge gave Ballyhale a 1-16 to 0-16 victory and a third All-Ireland medal for Fennelly.
Fennelly won an eighth and final championship medal in 1991 following a 3-16 to 1-8 defeat of St. Martin's.
Minor and under-21.
Fennelly first played for Kilkenny as a member of the minor team in 1972. A 7-10 to 0-4 trouncing of Wexford secured a second successive provincial title for the team and a Leinster medal for Fennelly. On 3 September 1972 Kilkenny faced Galway in the subsequent All-Ireland decider. The game was a one-sided affair, and at the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 8-7 to 3-9. The victory gave Fennelly an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal.
By 1974 Fennelly had joined the Kilkenny under-21 team and was captain of the side. He won his first Leinster medal that year as Kilkenny accounted for Wexford by 3-8 to 1-5. The subsequent All-Ireland decider against first-time finalists Waterford was a close affair, however, at the final whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 3-8 to 3-7. It was a first All-Ireland medal for Fennelly while he also had the honour of lifting the cup in Kilkenny's first title in that grade.
Fennelly added a second Leinster medal to his collection in 1975 as Kilkenny once again defeated Wexford by 3-14 to 0-8. The subsequent All-Ireland final against Cork was rated the best hurling game of the year. Kilkenny ‘keeper Kevin Fennelly brought off two brilliant saves from Con Brassil and Finbarr Delaney in the closing stages to secure a 5-13 to 2-19 victory and a second consecutive All-Ireland medal for Fennelly.
Senior.
Fennelly was added to the Kilkenny senior panel in 1974. He was an unused substitute throughout the entire championship campaign which saw Kilkenny claim the Leinster and All-Ireland titles.
On 29 June 1975 Fennelly made his senior championship debut in a 3-16 to 1-7 Leinster semi-final defeat of Dublin. He played no part in Kilkenny's subsequent Leinster and All-Ireland triumphs.
By 1978 Fennelly was still a substitute on the senior team. He was sprung from the bench in that year's provincial decider and collected his first Leinster medal on the field of play following Kilkenny's 2–16 to 1–16 defeat of reigning champions Wexford. Fennelly was confined to the bench for Kilkenny's subsequent 1–15 to 2–8 defeat by Cork in the All-Ireland final.
Fennelly was appointed captain of the team in 1979. He won a second successive Leinster medal that year as Wexford were defeated by 2-21 to 2-17. On 2 September 1979 Kilkenny faced Galway in the All-Ireland final. Bad weather and an unofficial train drivers’ strike resulted in the lowest attendance at a final in over twenty years. The bad weather also affected the hurling with Kilkenny scoring two freak goals as Galway ‘keeper Séamus Shinnors had a nightmare of a game. A Liam “Chunky” O’Brien 70-yard free went all the way to the net in the first half, while with just three minutes remaining a 45-yard shot from Mick Brennan was helped by the wind and dipped under the crossbar. Kilkenny won by 2-12 to 1-8 with Fennelly winning his first All-Ireland medal on the field of play while he also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup.
After a fallow two-year period, Kilkenny bounced back in 1982 with Fennelly winning his first National Hurling League medal following a 2-14 to 1-11 defeat of Wexford. He later added a third Leinster medal to his collection following a 1-11 to 0-12 defeat of three-in-a-row hopefuls and reigning All-Ireland champions Offaly. On 5 September 1982 Kilkenny and Cork renewed their rivalry in the All-Ireland decider. The Cats were rank outsiders on the day, however, a brilliant save by Noel Skehan was followed by two quick goals by Christy Heffernan just before the interval. Éamonn O'Donoghue pegged a goal back for Cork, however, Fennelly added a third for Kilkenny who secured a 3-18 to 1-13 victory. It was a second All-Ireland medal for Fennelly.
Fennelly won a second consecutive league medal in 1983 following a narrow 2-14 to 2-12 defeat of Limerick before later collecting a fourth Leinster medal as Offaly were accounted for by 1-17 to 0-13. The All-Ireland final on 4 September 1983 was a replay of the previous year with Cork hoping to avenge that defeat. Billy Fitzpatrick was the star with ten points, giving Kilkenny a 2-14 to 1-9 lead with seventeen minutes left, however, they failed to score for the remainder of the game. A stunning comeback by Cork just fell short and Fennelly collected a third All-Ireland medal following a 2-14 to 2-12 victory. He later won an All-Star.
In 1986 the team bounced back with Fennelly collecting a third league medal following a 2-10 to 2-6 defeat of Galway. He later collected a fifth Leinster medal following a 4-10 to 1-11 defeat of reigning champions Offaly.
Fennelly won a sixth and final Leinster medal in 1987 as Offaly were downed once again by 2-14 to 0-17. On 6 September 1987 Galway, a team who were hoping to avoid becoming the first team to lose three finals in-a-row, faced a Kilkenny team who for many of its players knew it would be their last chance to claim an All-Ireland medal. Galway 'keeper John Commins saved two goal chances from Ger Fennelly, while at the other end substitute Noel Lane bagged a decisive goal as Galway claimed a 1-12 to 0-9 victory.
During the 1989-90 league campaign Fennelly was dropped from the starting fifteen. He was an unused substitute as Kilkenny defeated New York by 0-19 to 0-9. Fennelly remained on the bench for Kilkenny's championship campaign which ended in a Leinster semi-final defeat by Offaly, thus bringing the curtain down on his inter-county career.
Inter-provincial.
Fennelly also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He played in the Railway Cup finals in 1983 and 1984, however, Fennelly never ended up on the winning side.
Coaching career.
In 1998 Fennelly was a selector with the Kilkenny minor hurling team. That year he helped steer the team to a Leinster title following a 2-15 to 0-6 defeat of Wexford in a replay. On 13 September 1998 Kilkenny faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider. A 2-15 to 1-9 defeat was the result on that occasion.

Frank Joslyn Baum

Frank Joslyn Baum (December 3, 1883 – December 2, 1958) was an American lawyer, soldier, writer, and film producer, and the first president of The International Wizard of Oz Club.
He is best known as the author of "To Please a Child" (a biography of his father, L. Frank Baum) (1962) and "The Laughing Dragon of Oz" (1936). He was involved in the production of "Wizard of Oz" (1925), and "The Wizard of Oz" (1933), for which he also received writing credit, after which he sold "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" film rights to Samuel Goldwyn.
His attempt to trademark the Oz name distanced him from the rest of his family. In addition, "To Please a Child" has been suspect since before it was published, as most of his family refused to confirm any details about his father's life, leading Baum to fabricate some details.
Early life and work.
Baum was born December 3, 1883, to Lyman Frank Baum and Maud Gage Baum, known by the nickname "Bunny". Like his brothers, Robert Stanton, Harry Neal, and Kenneth Gage, he attended the Society for Ethical Culture Sunday school, which taught morality without religion, as the Baums considered religion a mature decision. Despite his father's unflattering caricatures of the military, Baum had always desired to become a soldier, and he attended Michigan Military School in Orchard Lake, Michigan. He briefly attended Cornell University, studying law, and he would act as his parents' lawyer when they traveled abroad. He enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in the Philippines in 1904. He married Helen Louise Snow on June 27, 1906. His first notable contribution to the cinema was when he served as the projectionist for "The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays" (1908). Although he could not have the control that writers such as William K. Everson, Yuri Tsivian and others have claimed that early cinema projectionists had, due to the presence of the filmmakers in the room each night, it was a foray into the cinema that would pave the way for things to come. He also worked briefly for his father's publisher, Reilly &amp; Britton, worked in advertising in Chicago. He was the first member of the Baum family to move to the Los Angeles area.
Dramatic feature films.
When L. Frank Baum founded The Oz Film Manufacturing Company in 1914, Frank J. was established as the business director in the New York City office, at 300 W. 42nd Street in Times Square. After the company's failure, Frank J. regrouped the organization under the name Dramatic Feature Films. Exhibitors, however, were aware of the name change and were not interested in the Oz product by any name at all. Frank J. probably wrote the scripts for its two known films, "The Gray Nun of Belgium", a five-reel feature set during "the present war in Europe", and "Pies and Poetry", a short film, probably a slapstick comedy, although little is actually known about it beyond that both starred Betty Pierce in the lead. Sometimes these scripts are attributed to L. Frank, though this is not the case. Soon after the venture ended, Baum re-enlisted in the army and fought in World War I, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel.
"Wizard of Oz".
After the death of L. Frank Baum, Ruth Plumly Thompson was selected to continue the Oz series by publishers Reilly &amp; Lee. Frank Joslyn Baum had some desire to continue the series himself, but he represented his mother, who had turned over the rights to "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" to him once she had gotten them back from Harrison Rountree, who had acquired them after L. Frank Baum's bankruptcy, in this decision. After a long separation, Baum divorced his wife in 1921. Baum licensed the novel to I. E. Chadwick and Larry Semon, who created "Wizard of Oz" (1925). The film that was ultimately created bears the writing credit "L. Frank Baum, Jr., Leon Lee, and Larry Semon", with Lee also credited as title writer, though Frank J. may or may not have actually collaborated on the screenplay. The film bears almost no resemblance to the novel, but certainly seems to borrow on suggestions from "His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz". That film has a King Krewl, this film a Prime Minister Kruel. The novel that followed the film, "The Scarecrow of Oz", also mentions a deceased King Kynd, and there is a Prince Kynd in this film, to which was added a Lady Vishuss for the new film. The film depicts Dorothy Gale as an eighteen-year-old princess betrothed to Prince Kynd, whose throne is coveted by the Prime Minister and his Lady. A Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman [ sic ], and Cowardly Lion all appear, but they are nothing more than men who have put on disguises to avoid capture. The film bankrupted the studio, Chadwick Pictures, and it did not get a wide release.
A marriage to Rosine Agnes Shafer Brubeck lasted from July 29, 1932, to her death on September 2, 1934. In 1933, Baum, credited as "Col. Frank Baum" may also have written Ted Eshbaugh's animated short, "The Wizard of Oz", or he may simply have negotiated the license.
"The Laughing Dragon" controversy.
Baum was undaunted, and claimed to have written a 1931 radio drama called "Tweety in Oz", though no script has ever been found, which he followed with a 1934 story, "Jimmy Bulber in Oz", which was printed in order to achieve a trademark on the name "Oz" (it would later be reprinted in the International Wizard of Oz Club's "Oziana"). He demanded that Reilly &amp; Lee cease and desist publishing Oz books. Maud, who was the one who made the agreement with the publishers, had to sue him to get the trademark back, and she took Frank J. out of her will.
Finally, as "Frank Baum", he produced a two-part manuscript called "Rosine and the Laughing Dragon" that was broken into "The Laughing Dragon of Oz" and "The Enchanted Princess of Oz". He barely mentioned Oz in the text, and no Oz characters were used except for his own and a brief mention of the Wizard. His publisher, Whitman, was sued by Reilly &amp; Lee after publishing the first part in its Big Little Books series in 1936. The book quickly went out of print and Whitman agreed not to publish the sequel. Baum sold the rights to "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" to Samuel Goldwyn on January 26, 1934, for $60,000. Goldwyn sat on the rights, and ultimately sold them to MGM for the production of "The Wizard of Oz" (1939), for which Goldwyn saw a large profit that none of the Baums did.
"To Please a Child" and Oz Club Presidency.
Baum married Margaret Elizabeth Ligon Turner on August 19, 1940. After Maud died in 1953, he was admitted back into The Baum Trust, but he had gained only the tolerance, and not the faith of his family. From time to time he would write articles about his father's work, the most notable being "The Oz Film Co.", which appeared in the August–September 1956 "Films in Review", which appeared when the films had been generally forgotten. When Justin G. Schiller founded the International Wizard of Oz Club, Baum was appointed its first president, and served in that position until his death. He had been friendly with the founding members, who were unaware of his family conflicts. He had been working in near-isolation on a biography of his father, eventually titled "To Please a Child", derived from an inscription L. Frank Baum wrote in his sister Mary Louise's copy of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz", after a suggestion by Fred M. Meyer, the club secretary. His brother Robert was the only member of his family to provide any information. Russell P. MacFall became his collaborator, but he had difficulty speaking with Baum's family. They were willing to discuss family matters only after Baum had died. Reilly and Lee had imposed a 1961 deadline, and the book that appeared is filled with Frank Joslyn Baum's mythologizing about his father, claiming so far as that L. Frank Baum had had a heart attack at age 12 and had marched in a torchlight parade in support of William Jennings Bryan's presidential candidacy, both of which were fabrications.
Baum died from a heart attack on December 2, 1958, a day before his 75th birthday.
Legacy.
Frank Joslyn Baum is grandfather of Roger S. Baum, who similarly writes Oz books within a mythos that appears to be distinct from the one about which L. Frank Baum wrote.
"" credits Michael Patrick Hearn as a principal source. While Hearn collaborated with David Brooks on the original treatment, the final script by Richard Matheson primarily relied upon "To Please a Child". In the film, Frank Joslyn Baum (called "Frank, Jr." in the credits) was played by three actors, Joshua Boyd (age 3), Tim Eyster (ages 5–9), and Christopher Pettiet (teenage).

"People" wrote that Lisa has "a rich, versatile sound and the vocal strength to penetrate the album’s percussion-heavy arrangements." "The Globe and Mail" thought that Lisa's "accounts of her various sex and dance urges are both funny and salacious." The "Los Angeles Times" called the album "an urban contemporary kitchen sink—everything is in there, from dance to doo-wop to crackling funk to spicy salsa." "USA Today" deemed Lisa "today's Ronnie Spector: a technically limited singer who succeeds by projecting a girlish attitude that's both vulnerable and indomitable."

Saint Helena national cricket team

The St Helena cricket team represents the small and remote British Overseas Territory of St Helena in international cricket. It is organised by the St Helena Cricket Association, which is a member of the Africa Cricket Association (ACA). The association joined the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2001 as an affiliate member and became an associate member in 2017. The team made its international debut in 2012.
History.
In April 2012, St Helena competed in its first international tournament, the ICC Africa Division 3 T20 Tournament. It was held in South Africa where St Helena beat Mali, Gambia, Cameroon and Morocco. They finished in the fifth place out of eight teams. The team had to raise £24,000 to travel to South Africa, making a five-day sea trip aboard as the island did not have an airport at the time.
In April 2018, they were drawn in the Southern sub-region group in the 2018 ICC World Twenty20 African Sub Regional Qualifier tournament. Later the same month, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between St Helena and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 were full T20Is. St Helena won their first three matches in the Sub Regional Qualifier, recording victories against Eswatini, Malawi and Lesotho. They finished the tournament in third place but failed to reach the Regional Finals.
St Helena was drawn in Qualifier A in the African qualification for the 2024 T20 World Cup, facing seven teams in Rwanda in November 2022. The team and support staff were given free airfares on Airlink, the only airline flying to the island.

Aidos

Aidos or Aedos (; Greek: , ) was the Greek personification of either shame or modesty. Aidos, as a quality, was that feeling of reverence or shame which restrains men from wrong. It also encompassed the emotion that a rich person might feel in the presence of the impoverished, that their disparity of wealth, whether a matter of luck or merit, was ultimately undeserved. Ancient and Christian humility share common themes: they both reject egotism, self-centeredness, arrogance, and excessive pride; they also recognize human limitations. Aristotle defined it as a middle ground between vanity and cowardice. 
Mythology.
She was the last goddess to leave the earth after the Golden Age. She was a close companion of the goddess of vengeance Nemesis. One source calls her daughter of Prometheus. Mythologically, she is often considered to be more of a personification than a physical deity.
There are references to her in various early Greek plays, such as "Prometheus Bound" by Aeschylus, "Iphigenia at Aulis" by Euripides, and "Oedipus Rex" by Sophocles.
There were altars to Aidos in Athens and in Sparta. Icarius, a Spartan king, tried to persuade his daughter Penelope to stay in Sparta after her marriage to Odysseus. When Odysseus made Penelope choose between her father and her husband, she modestly covered her face with a veil, signaling her decision to leave with Odysseus. Understanding her choice, Icarius let them go and commemorated the moment by erecting a statue of Aidos at the spot. 
Some sources mention Aeschyne (Ancient Greek: ) as a personification of shame and reverence.

Guillermo Gómez Rivera

Guillermo Gómez Rivera (; born 12 September 1936) is a Spanish Filipino multilingual author, historian, educator and linguistic scholar whose lifelong work has been devoted to the advocacy to preserve Spanish culture as an important element of the Filipino identity (according to Hispanista movement).
Gómez is the most senior academic director of the Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española. In 1975, he was awarded the Premio Zobel, the Philippines' highest literary honor bestowed on works in Spanish. He was appointed secretary of the Commission on the Filipino Language Committee of the Philippine Constitutional Convention (1971–73).
Biography.
Guillermo Gómez y Rivera was born in Dingle, Iloilo on the southeast portion of Panay Island and graduated from the University of San Agustin in Iloilo City with degrees in commerce and in education. In 1967, he earned a BA from the Colegio de San Juan de Letrán. Shortly afterwards, he obtained a doctorate in Philippine Literature under the tutelage of a Jesuit academic.
He has been a lifelong advocate of the Spanish language in the Philippines. Most of his written works argue in favor of the preservation of the Philippine-Hispanic identity of the country.
 Philippine Constitutional Convention (1971–1973) during the presidency of Ferdinand E. Marcos, he favored Tagalog to become the basis of the country's national language. In the same convention, he joined forces with other nationalists to preserve Spanish as one of the country's official languages. Spanish, however, was later made an optional language (together with Arabic) under the Constitution of 1987 which was promulgated under the presidency of Corazón Aquino who abolished the 1973 constitution under Marcos.
Literature, history and culture.
Literary critics regard Gómez's writing style as combative.
Organizers of the Premio Zóbel, in awarding him the prize in 1975, cited "his efforts to preserve the Spanish language and culture in our country," although some literary historians mistakenly believe he won the award solely for his play "El caseron." Prior to winning the Premio Zóbel, Gómez won second place in the Premio Manuel Bernabé for an essay on the historical and nationalistic value and importance of the Spanish language.
Gómez, as editor of "Nueva era", a weekly and only remaining Spanish language newspaper in the Philippines, has used his editorials to attack government officials whom he accuses as "vile puppets of U.S. WASP neocolonialism," claiming proofs to bolster his accusations. Through his body of literary works, he has urged Filipino readers to "rediscover" their Spanish past in order for them to gain knowledge of their true national identity.
He views cultural dissemination as a tool to accomplish his advocacy, particularly through dance. His research on Philippine songs and dances, especially those of Hispanic influence, was used by the internationally acclaimed Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company to choreograph some of its performances with him acting as adviser for the group.
Gómez is also a recording artist who has cut an album of Filipino songs that were originally in Spanish as well as in Chavacano. He is credited for reintroducing to the modern local film industry the now forgotten film "Secreto de confesión", the first locally produced film spoken and sung in Spanish ("la primera película hablada y cantada en español producida en Filipinas").
His efforts to bring back the Filipino national identity based on Spanish have led some critics, such as poet-academician Edmundo Farolán and poet-novelist Gilbert Luis R. Centina III, to call him "El Don Quixote Filipino."
In May 2015, Gómez published his first novel, "Quis ut Deus" (Who Is Like God), the first Spanish-language novel published in the Philippines in the last 55 years.
Flamenco.
Gómez honed his dancing skills in short courses conducted by Spanish international dancers such as "Los Chavales de España," Antonio Ruiz and José Greco who visited Manila in the 1970s and the 1980s. But his introduction to flamenco came much earlier at the age of four when he learned it, along with many other Spanish dances, from Rosa Jiménez. She was a flamenco dancer from Sevilla, Spain and the second wife of his maternal grandfather, José Rivera Franco.
Educator.
Gómez spent several years teaching Spanish grammar, Philippine history and philosophy at Adamson University. For a time, he served as the head of Adamson's Spanish department. He retired from the university in 2001.
During his teaching stint, he was president of "Corporación Nacional de Profesores en Español" (CONAPE), an organization of Filipino educators who teach the Spanish language.
Media.
Gómez's journalism career started with the magazine "El maestro" during the 1960s. Its goal was to aid Filipino teachers in Spanish in the practice of their profession. Aside from being the editor of "Nueva era", he also edits two other weeklies: "The Listening Post" and "The Tagalog Chronicle." In 1997, he worked on television as a segment host of ABS-CBN's now defunct early morning program Alas Singko y Medya, presenting a five-minute Spanish lesson. Gómez released an LP back in 1960 when he was producing "La voz hispanofilipina", a radio program on DZRH. It was a product of his research on a number of 'lost' Filipino songs sung in Spanish during the Spanish colonial era. He reintroduced the songs through the LP entitled "Nostalgia filipina", where his vocal interpretation is accompanied by a rondalla.
Digitally remastered with funding from the Spanish Program for Cultural Cooperation, the LP was reissued and launched at Instituto Cervantes de Manila on August 14, 2006.

"Christmas Crackers" is the first Christmas special episode of the BBC sitcom "Only Fools and Horses". It was originally screened on 28 December 1981 and is the first episode of the series to run at over 30 minutes.
Synopsis.
It is Christmas Day and Grandad is cooking the dinner while Rodney is reading a book on body language which Mickey Pearce has lent him. Del Boy arrives and gives Grandad £20 for Christmas, however Grandad tells Del that he has not got him a present this year as "I don't agree with the commercialisation of a Christian festival." Rodney is worried about Grandad's cooking, and suggests to Del that they go on a hunger strike to get out of eating it, but Del refuses, saying that it is Grandad's role to cook the dinner as it makes him feel as though he is still needed in the family.
Later, as the trio sit down to Christmas dinner, Del is horrified to discover that the turkey is under-cooked and still contains the melted bag of giblets stuffed inside along with the sage and onion stuffing. Christmas Pudding is no better, which Grandad has literally burnt to a cinder.
Later that evening Del is snoozing on the sofa while Rodney begrudgingly watches a circus on the television. Waking Del with his protestations of boredom, Rodney suggests that he and Del visit the "Monte Carlo Club" in New Cross for a drink. They begin to argue, with Del explaining that Grandad would be hurt if they left him alone on Christmas night. However, Grandad appears and announces he is off out to a Christmas party as he is annoyed by the brothers arguing. Consequently, Del and Rodney decide to go out after all.
At the nightclub, Rodney spots two attractive woman sitting at a table on the other side of the bar. Intending to go over and flirt to them, he prepares himself by reading from Mickey Pearce's body language book. He attempts a "masculine walk" to impress the girls which Del teases him about, and Rodney becomes embarrassed. The two spend most of the evening arguing about the best way to approach the girls, taking so long over it that, by the time they get around to approaching the women, they find that two other men have beaten them to it.
Music.
Note: In the Original Broadcast version the tune Xenon Lights from Jane Fonda's Walkout I was playing in the nightclub whilst Del and Rodney were waiting to sit down. In all future releases including the VHS/DVD versions, this tune has been replaced by "Wordy Rappinghood" by Tom Tom Club.
Ronnie Hazlehurst: "Original Theme Tune"
Note: In the original series 1 broadcasts of Only Fools and Horses, the theme tune was very different to the version adopted from series 2, which became the standard version known today. Composed by Ronnie Hazlehurst, the original theme tune was a jazzy instrumental tune that played over the start and end credits. This tune was replaced in series 2 with a version written and sung by John Sullivan. After the initial run of series 1, all future re-runs replaced the Hazlehurst version with John Sullivan's to match the other series. The VHS/DVD versions all contain John Sullivan's version, and recordings with Hazlehurst's original tune are extremely rare, though it can be heard in a scene during episode 1 of the first series.

Association football at the 1956 Summer Olympics

The association football tournament at the 1956 Summer Olympics was won by the Soviet Union.
Defending champions Hungary were forced to withdraw due to the Soviet invasion of their country. This was the first Olympic football tournament where all the medalists were communist countries, with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria took silver and bronze respectively.
Background.
Following five withdrawals, the tournament featured three Eastern Bloc teams and four from Asia. The other sides included in the draw were the United States, the United Team of Germany (which was "de facto" West Germany), Great Britain and the hosts Australia, competing in their first Olympic football tournament.
The tendency of Eastern bloc countries to provide state-funding for their athletes put Western amateurs at a significant disadvantage. As a result, all Olympic football tournaments 1952 onwards were dominated by the Soviet Union and its satellites.
First round.
Hungary announced their withdrawal on 31 August, a day before the draw. The draw was made with fifteen teams, India receiving a bye. Four more teams withdrew after the final draw: China (boycotted the Games to protest the reception of Taiwan), Egypt (withdrew due to Suez Crisis), Turkey and Vietnam.
Therefore, only three games were played in the first round: as China and Turkey had been drawn against each other, their match was scratched.
The Soviet Union defeated the United Team of Germany 2–1, Great Britain defeated Thailand 9–0, and Australia defeated Japan 2–0.
Byes: Bulgaria (drawn against Egypt, who withdrew), India, Indonesia (drawn against Vietnam, who withdrew), USA and Yugoslavia (drawn against each other: match was postponed to the quarter-finals).
Quarter-finals.
Yugoslavia defeated the United States 9–1.
Bulgaria led Great Britain 3–1 at half-time, when ratings from vaulted the fence and exhorted the team to show more grit, after which they were peacefully escorted off the field. The British team went on to lose 6–1.
The Soviet Union drew their game against Indonesia 0–0 and won 4–0 in the replay.
The Indians defeated Australia 4–2 with a hat trick by centre forward Neville D'Souza, the first by an Asian in the Olympics. Prior to the game there had been debate, once again, as to whether the Indians should be shod. Sir Stanley Rous respected their decision either way, although in the end, the Indians decided to wear boots.
Semi-finals.
Yugoslavia defeated India 4–1. It would be their third consecutive Olympic final, after losing both in 1948 and 1952.
The Soviets defeated Bulgaria 2–1. Normal time finished 0–0, and Bulgaria scored first in extra time before conceding two goals in the last six minutes of the game.
Bronze medal match.
Bulgaria took Bronze defeating India 3–0.

WriteAPrisoner.com

WriteAPrisoner.com is an online Florida-based business. The business's goal is to reduce recidivism through a variety of methods that include positive correspondence with pen pals on the outside, educational opportunities, job placement avenues, resource guides, scholarships for children affected by crime, and advocacy. The site began primarily as a place to post pen-pal profiles and requests for legal assistance for inmates and has evolved to take a more comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges in the life of an inmate. Studies show many inmates have experienced trauma early in their lives that may have been the impetus for the actions that led to incarceration.
Background.
There are approximately 17,000 inmates profiled on the site, most of whom are incarcerated in the United States; however, the site also includes international inmates. Although the site provides no Internet access of any kind to inmates, it has often been called the MySpace and Facebook for inmates by the media. Because the business is housed online and includes inmate profiles, it has been compared to social media; however, most agencies recognize it as promoting traditional pen-pal postal mail because the site provides no mechanism for inmates to access the site online. By 2003, the site had about 10,000 hits per day and presented profiles from inmates in about a dozen countries. Inmates using WriteAPrisoner.com only have access to postal mail. Inmates pay at least $65 per year (with additional options that cost more) to post their profile and photo, which are viewed by the public at no cost. The site encourages writing directly to inmates or sending a first message through its free e-mail forwarding service. The founder of the company is Adam Lovell, author of "WriteAPrisoner.com's SELF-HELP GUIDE FOR INMATES: Flourishing Through Adversity". In 2010 the website received about 2 million page views per month.
Media.
The site received national media attention in July 2003 when Susan Smith, a young mother convicted of killing her children, posted a profile seeking pen-pals, which received 800,000 hits. Smith received more than 6,000 letters in response to her profile. The South Carolina Department of Corrections issued a press release related to the incident. WriteAPrisoner.com removed the profile at Smith's request. The site received some criticism when its spokesperson used the term "freak show" to describe the media coverage of the Susan Smith story. The site later issued a press release apologizing and stating that the term had been taken out of context. 
The site has been featured on many programs including "20/20" and "E! True Hollywood Story". In March 2006, the site made local news when it posted a profile for Adrian Peeler, who was convicted in the killing of an eight-year-old boy and his mother. The site immediately removed Peeler's profile when the story was featured in the "Connecticut Post". The site had also featured a profile for Peeler's brother, Russell Peeler, who was involved in the murder. His profile was also removed by the site. Several states have placed a ban on inmate penpal sites in response to these issues, which the site founder has stated is a violation of the First Amendment.
On October 28, 2014, Lifetime aired the "Prison Wives Club" reality show, which features some couples from WriteAPrisoner.com in the series. Artist Benjamin Wills' popular exhibit "Airplanes" at the Kansas City Public Library featured paper airplanes made by inmates contacted through the site. In 2019, Netflix released a new show, "Exhibit A", in which an inmate from WriteAPrisoner.com was featured in the first episode. The third and fourth season of WE tv's "Love After Lockup" also featured inmates from the site.
Some controversies involved claims of inmates misleading the public. When the state of Missouri investigated claims that several dozen female inmates were deceiving male pen pals, the proactive response of the site resulted in a positive response by the public. A study conducted by the University of Louisville reported that not all inmates on the site accurately reported their crimes or release dates at one point. However, this study was rebutted by the site. WriteAPrisoner.com provides a link from each inmate's profile to his or her respective department of corrections website so the public can verify the information. Studies have confirmed the act of maintaining a pen-pal relationship for an inmate has had proven benefits to the inmate's well-being, reform, and recovery from substance abuse. Some inmates have used the website to gain support from the public to help overturn wrongful convictions. Others found freedom through the site after their profiles attracted the attention of attorneys and human rights groups.
In 2020, TikTok users discovered the site, generating more than 65 million views, with the trend continuing.
Research.
Universities continue to conduct research surrounding the benefits of inmate correspondence and even participating in letter-writing with inmates. In 2019, Duke Law hosted a Write A Prisoner letter-writing event as part of the National Lawyers Guild's recognition of the Week Against Mass Incarceration. In 2015, University of Warwick shared findings of research at the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Festival of Social Science. The study involved prison pen pals in 52 prisons throughout England and Wales and cited numerous mental health benefits to inmates. San Diego State University graduate student Tania Mejia-O'Donnell, a 2018-2019 Inamori Fellow, explored inmates' pen pal experiences through WriteaPrisoner.com.
Legal.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has upheld inmates' right to receive e-mail printouts from online pen pals. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit also found that inmates have the constitutional right to seek pen pals through websites. An Arizona law that barred inmates from posting profiles on WriteAPrisoner.com and similar websites was struck down after the ACLU challenged it in court. In considering legislation which would prohibit inmates from utilizing social media such as Facebook, officials in South Carolina made a point to exclude WriteAPrisoner.com from the bill, citing WriteAPrisoner.com's vetting process of inmates' information and the fact that it does not provide a mechanism for Internet contact for inmates. While WriteAPrisoner.com does not allow inmates any form of actual Internet contact, many prisons now have services such as Corrlinks, which allows inmates monitored email access for a fee.
According to the site, the goal is to work with states' departments of corrections to ensure that the First Amendment rights of inmates are protected. The site has previously collaborated with the ACLU and the Florida Justice Institute regarding rights of inmates and has been represented by the Florida Justice Institute. The site's stated policy includes a zero-tolerance approach towards scams committed by inmates as well as scams committed against inmates.

Biju

Biju (Malayalam: ബിജു) is a popular male name in India, especially in Bengal, Orissa, Kerala, Bangladesh, and India, where he name means "second son".
"Biju" is derived from the similar rhyming name "Viju". It is highly likely that "Viju" is an affectionate version of the name "Vijaya", which means "Victory" in Sanskrit and several Indian languages. It has a similar meaning in Chinese as well. Biju is associated with Arjuna, the great warrior hero of the Mahabharatha.
In Kerala, the name Biju is used by all communities: Hindus, Christians, and Muslims, and thus is a secular name, although many have added suffixes which indicate their caste or community. For example, Biju Cheriya Othayoth Eramala (ബിജു ചെറിയ ഒതയോത് ബാലകൃഷ്ണൻ ഏറാമല ), in which ബിജു is the first name, ബാലകൃഷ്ണൻ is the first letter of father's name and ചെറിയ ഒതയോത് is the house name.
This name also may have derived from the French word "bijou" (pronounced "bizhu"), meaning "jewel."

<doc id="7008327" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7008327" title="Greek Military Police">
Greek Military Police

The Military Police (), is the military police of the Hellenic Army.
It was formerly known as the Greek Military Police (), and by the acronym ESA (), between 1951 and 1976. Up until Metapolitefsi, it developed into a powerful organization within the Army and a stronghold of right-wing, conservative Army officers. It became the main security (secret police) and intelligence organization during the Greek military junta of 1967–1974, as martial law was introduced widely. Its Special Investigative Section engaged in widespead abuse against officers and soldiers and thus, following the fall of the junta and the restoration of democracy in 1974, it was gradually cleansed of torturers and reorganized into its current form.
Establishment.
The ESA was established in 1951, as Greece was preparing to join NATO. Up until then, the Greek Army did not have a specialized military police force, with the Hellenic Gendarmerie acting as military police whereas necessary. Being posted in the ESA was a major bonus for Army officers because it had very extensive powers within the military, even before the dictatorship. Both the officers and the soldiers who served in ESA were picked for their extreme, almost paranoid, anti-communism. This resulted in making ESA a bastion of the most conservative and anti-democratic members of the Greek officer corps. ESA men wore a distinctive uniform with a royal blue cap cover (whilst the soldiers wore a beret at the time), golden lanyard on their right shoulder and an armband with the letters ESA around their left arm. The uniform remains unchanged save for the ESA acronym, which has now been replaced by SN.
During the Junta.
In April 1967, shortly after seizing power in a coup, junta leader George Papadopoulos appointed Dimitrios Ioannides chief of the ESA, which gradually had been transformed into an internal security army.
When Papadopoulos declared Martial law after the 1967 coup, he increased the power of the ESA even further by making it the junta's chief arm of law and order as well as repression. Under Ioannides, ESA rose to a force of more than 20,000 men.
Thousands of the junta's political opponents were arrested by the ESA and sent to some of the Aegean's most desolate islands, called the prison islands. Many of the allegations of prisoner torture under the Papadopoulos regime involved the ESA, in particular its Special Investigative Section (, tr. "Eidikón Anakritikón Tmíma"), commonly known in its abbreviated form as ΕAT or EAT/ESA ().
Use of torture chambers by ESA during interrogations was reported during the Greek military junta years. Alexandros Panagoulis was one example of a person tortured at the EAT/ESA interrogation cell units. Greek politician Nikos Konstantopoulos is another example. Army Major Spyros Moustaklis was left brain damaged and unable to speak after the torture he endured at EAT/ESA.
Alarmed at moves Papadopoulos was making towards a transition to democratic rule, Ioannidis used his position and power as ESA chief to oust him from power.
The ESA was disbanded in 1974 by Constantine Karamanlis and its leading members involved in torture were court-martialled and sentenced during the Greek junta trials, although many served only token prison terms. This was because torture was not a recorded criminal offence in the penal code when it was perpetrated, and thus they could only be prosecuted for grievous bodily harm. Notably, 3 ESA members (out of the 37 prosecuted) were sentenced in 23, 22, and 17 years in prison as their charges included assault against superior officers held in ESA after the 1973 mutiny plot, charges later reduced upon appeal.
Members.
Research based on interviews with 21 former ESA members shows that all had been men had been drafted, first into regular military service and then into the ESA. Carried out by Janice T. Gibson and Mika Haritos-Fatouros, the research also showed that recruits underwent series of rigorous treatments and training over a matter of months in order to prepare them psychologically for the task of torturing detainees.
Buildings.
The headquarters of the Special Interrogation Sections of the Military Police (EAT-ESA) was in a building which now houses the Eleftherios Venizelos Museum at Eleftherias Park, Vassilissis Sofias Avenue in Athens.
Operating doctrine.
According to witnesses at the court martial proceedings, ESA's operating doctrine was:
"Those who enter here, exit either as friends or as cripples."
After 1974.
Law 276/76 renamed ESA simply to "Military Police" (Στρατονομία, "Stratonomia").
Corresponding organizations exist also for the other two branches of the Greek armed forces: for the Hellenic Air Force (Αερονομία, Aeronomia), founded in 1945 as "Greek Air Force Police" (Ἑλληνική Ἀεροπορικὴ Ἀστυνομία, EAA), and for the Hellenic Navy (Ναυτονομία, Naftonomia, properly Υπηρεσία Ναυτονομίας or Y.NΑ.).
These three forces work together often but are independent from each other. Most of the personnel are draftee soldiers undergoing their regular military service.

<doc id="7008368" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7008368" title="The New Andy Griffith Show">
The New Andy Griffith Show

The New Andy Griffith Show is an American sitcom that was broadcast in the United States on CBS in 1971 on Fridays at 8:30 ET. It debuted on January 8, 1971, and ended on May 21, 1971.
History.
Actor Andy Griffith had left his first sitcom, "The Andy Griffith Show", voluntarily after the 1967–68 season while it was still number one in the Nielsen ratings and despite a high-dollar offer from CBS to continue it, in order to pursue his other interests, singing and motion picture acting, and to prevent his being typecast solely as a rural Southern sheriff.
When he decided to return to network television two years later, in the fall of 1970, it was in "Headmaster", a drama, in which he played the headmaster of an exclusive California private school. When that program very quickly sank in the ratings, Griffith replaced it immediately with this one, which was much closer in tone and content to his earlier, more successful role (also sharing some writers and music director Earle Hagen), and this program replaced "Headmaster" on the CBS Friday night schedule effective January 8, 1971.
"The New Andy Griffith Show" fulfilled the ten remaining episodes of "Headmaster's" series commitment and was not renewed beyond that season, with the last new episode airing March 12.
Synopsis.
Griffith portrays Andy Sawyer, who upon returning to his hometown is immediately installed as the new Mayor "pro tem". The series is set in the fictional small city of Greenwood, North Carolina, with a population slightly under 13,000 residents and thus noticeably larger than Mayberry.
Andy Sawyer was the model family man, always agreeable and understanding, spending much quality time with his children. His character bore more of the folksy attitude Griffith had previously portrayed in early episodes of "The Andy Griffith Show" and the 1958 teleplay and film "No Time for Sergeants".
Lee Meriwether was cast as Andy's wife, reprising a pairing of the two from the 1969 film "Angel in My Pocket". Marty McCall and Lori Rutherford were seen as Griffith's children, T.J. and Lori, respectively, while Ann Morgan Guilbert portrayed Lee's sister Nora, a live-in relative who was constantly complaining, neurotic, meddling and superstitious. Rotund country comic Glen Ash was cast as town councilman Buff McKnight. Ruth McDevitt played Mrs. Gossage.
Reception.
The premiere episode was a major success for CBS, buoyed by guest appearances by "The Andy Griffith Show" regulars Don Knotts, George Lindsey and Paul Hartman. Lindsey and Hartman explicitly played "Goober" and "Emmett", their characters on both "The Andy Griffith Show" and "Mayberry R.F.D." (still on the air at the time); this is confirmed in both dialogue and in the closing credits. Knotts, meanwhile, played an unnamed character who was identical in mannerisms to Barney Fife of "The Andy Griffith Show". All three characters were "old friends" of the character Andy Sawyer; they dropped by his new house, ostensibly to welcome him to town, but actually to seek political favors. These Mayberry characters treated Andy Sawyer "exactly" as if he were Andy Taylor, and the two characters had similar backstories: both Andys by this point were married and had two children (although Taylor's two sons, Opie and infant Andy Jr., were both boys as opposed to Sawyer's one boy and one girl), and prior to the start of "The New Andy Griffith Show", both were living in larger cities.
Overall, the introduction of characters from Mayberry along with the similarities in character, writing, music and show title gave the appearance that the show was an alternate version of Griffith's earlier show, only with some names and details changed, creating confusion. Griffith also blamed the bad reputation of "Headmaster" for making it more difficult for "The New Andy Griffith Show" to succeed. Coincidentally, CBS had a public desire to overhaul its image to appeal to wealthier, more sophisticated audiences, which left the network less eager to promote rural sitcoms that previously had been a network staple.
Although the premiere gathered respectable ratings, viewership quickly declined over the next several weeks, and after ten episodes, CBS canceled the series on March 12, 1971. These ten episodes repeated through May 21, then were replaced with reruns of "Headmaster" during the summer.

Cascajal Block

The Cascajal Block is a tablet-sized slab serpentinite dated to the early first millennium BCE, incised with previously unknown characters that have been claimed to represent the earliest writing system in the New World. Archaeologist Stephen D. Houston of Brown University said that this discovery helps to "link the Olmec civilization to literacy, document an unsuspected writing system, and reveal a new complexity to [the Olmec] civilization."
Discovery.
The Cascajal Block was discovered by road builders in the late 1990s in a pile of debris in the village of Lomas de Tacamichapan in the Veracruz lowlands in the ancient Olmec heartland on the southeastern coast of Mexico. The block was found amidst ceramic shards and clay figurines and from these the block is dated to the San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán phase, which ended , preceding the oldest Zapotec writing dated to . Archaeologists Carmen Rodriguez and Ponciano Ortiz of the National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico examined and registered it with government historical authorities. It weighs about and measures . Details of the find were published by researchers in the 15 September 2006 issue of the journal "Science".
Analysis.
The Olmec flourished on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . The evidence for the Cascajal writing system is based solely on the text on the Cascajal Block, but existence of a system of Olmec hieroglyphs has been postulated independently from the Cascajal Block on the basis of previous discoveries of glyphs individually or in small groups. Their relation with the Cascajal Block is unclear.
The block holds a total of 62 glyphs, some of which resemble plants such as maize and pineapple, or animals such as insects and fish. Many of the symbols are more abstract boxes or blobs. The symbols on the Cascajal block are unlike those of any other writing system in Mesoamerica, such as in Mayan languages or Isthmian, another extinct Mesoamerican script. The Cascajal block is also unusual because the symbols apparently run in horizontal rows and "there is no strong evidence of overall organization. The sequences appear to be conceived as independent units of information". All other known Mesoamerican scripts typically use vertical rows.
Skepticism of authenticity.
Some archaeologists are skeptical of the tablet:
Formal criticism.
The most comprehensive criticism was published in the journal "Science", the publisher of the original study, on 9 March 2007. In a letter, archaeologists Karen Bruhns and Nancy Kelker raise five points of concern:
A rebuttal to the criticism by the authors of the original study was published directly following the letter:
Archaeometric analyses.
A 2019 study by Joshua D. Englehardt et al. made an effort to establish the origin of the block via archaeometric techniques. Their findings supported the authenticity of the block as an Olmec-age artifact based on several qualities:

Samuel A'Court Ashe

Samuel A'Court Ashe (September 13, 1840 – August 31, 1938) was a Confederate infantry captain in the American Civil War and celebrated editor, historian, and North Carolina legislator. Prior to his death in 1938, he was the last surviving commissioned officer of the Confederate States Army. Samuel's father, William Shepperd Ashe (1814–1862), served in the North Carolina state senate and as a United States Congressman. The United Confederate Veterans conferred the title of Brigadier General upon Samuel A. Ashe in 1936 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Ashe is also noted for his booklet on the war titled "A Southern View of the Invasion of the Southern States and War of 1861-65."
Early life.
Born in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, in 1840, Ashe grew up near Wilmington and spent much of his life in Raleigh. He attended the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, where he met future naval historian and lifelong friend Alfred Thayer Mahan.
Occupations.
When the war erupted, Ashe enlisted in the Confederate Army and served for its duration, rising to the rank of captain. Among his duty assignments was serving at Fort Caswell, on the eastern end of Oak Island.
After the war, Samuel married Hannah Emerson Willard in 1871 and had nine children (one of whom was William Willard Ashe, the noted botanist and associate of the United States Forest Service). Samuel studied law in Wilmington, later establishing a law practice there. Active in the Democratic Party, Ashe worked for several government departments and ultimately served in the North Carolina House of Representatives. As a legislator, Ashe revised North Carolina tax laws concerning the resolution of state debts.
Ashe became editor of the "Raleigh Daily News", and subsequently purchased the "Raleigh Daily Observer", merging the two to become editor of both publications. A prolific writer, he wrote many materials between the period of 1908 and 1935 on the subjects of North Carolina history, the Civil War, and the post-war South. Perhaps Captain Ashe's most renowned publication is his booklet on the war published in 1935 and titled "A Southern View of the Invasion of the Southern States and War of 1861-65", in which he addressed the subject of the constitutionality of the South's secession from the United States and other similar topics pertaining to the Confederacy, Abraham Lincoln, and the war.
Death.
He died on August 31, 1938, at age 97 and was buried at the Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh. On September 13, 1940, a memorial in his honor was unveiled on Capitol Square in Raleigh. This monument denotes that he was "a patriot, soldier, historian, legislator, editor, and Christian citizen."

Kill the Moonlight (film)

Kill the Moonlight is a 16mm feature film completed in 1991. It is an unconventional comedy about a stock car racer. As the film unfolds, the main character starts to unravel in strange ways when he is contaminated by toxic waste. At the same time, the plot of the film disintegrates and scenes start to go out of sync, and the picture goes upside down and backwards at times. Two of the film's characters are sampled in Beck's hit song "Loser". The film was unprinted and seen by very few until 1994 when it premiered at the Rome Italy Film Festival.
Synopsis.
A stock car racer blows a rod and his car catches fire. To raise money to get back into the game he works as fish hatchery worker, toxic waste cleaner, drug peddler and thief. Director Steve Hanft captures the life of a loser in slices of life as his surreal illegal days unfold in a different kind of narrative that casually leaves out plot and resolution.
Soundtrack.
First issued by Sympathy for the Record Industry in 1997, the out of print soundtrack to "Kill The Moonlight" was reissued with the Plexifilm DVD release, this time including tracks from Beck and Steve Hanft's band Loser.

Nehemiah Wallington

Nehemiah Wallington (1598–1658) was an English Puritan artisan (a wood turner) and chronicler from Eastcheap. He left over 2,500 pages and 50 volumes on himself, religion and politics, 8 of which survive.
Life.
Born on 12 May 1598, he was the tenth child of John Wallington (d. 1641), a turner of St. Leonard's, Eastcheap, by his wife Elizabeth (d. 1603), daughter of Anthony Hall (d. 1597), a citizen and skinner of London.
He recorded his ten suicide attempts of 1618–19; trying poison, hanging, and even contemplating drowning and cutting open his own throat– all because he took his lustful feelings as a sign of reprobation.
A little before 1620 Nehemiah entered into business on his own account as a turner, and took a house in Little Eastcheap, between Pudding Lane and Fish-street Hill. There he passed the remainder of an uneventful life. In 1639 he and his brother John were summoned before the court of Star-chamber on the charge of possessing prohibited books. He acknowledged that he had possessed William Prynne's "Divine Tragedie", Matthew White's "Newes from Ipswich", and Henry Burton's "Apology of an Appeale", but pleaded that he no longer owned them. He was kept under surveillance by the court for about two years, but suffered no further penalty.
In 1619 or 1620 he was married to Grace, sister of Zachariah and Livewell Rampain (Rampaigne). Zachariah was killed in Ireland on a plantation in 1641. Livewell was minister at Burton, near Lincoln, and afterwards at Broxholme. By her Wallington had several children, of whom only a daughter, Sara, survived him. She was married to a puritan, named John Haughton, on 20 November 1641. Wallington died in the summer or autumn of 1658.
Works.
Wallington left three compilations of contemporary events.
Wallington's "Historical Notes" were published in 1869 (London, 2 vols. 8vo) under the editorship of Miss R. Webb, with the title "Historical Notices of Events occurring chiefly in the Reign of Charles I".

Enda Muldoon

Enda Muldoon (born 11 September 1977) is a former Gaelic footballer who played for the Derry county team and has won an Ulster Senior Football Championship and two National League titles with the county, as well as Ulster Minor, Ulster Under 21 and All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championships. He also won an All Star Award for his performances in the 2004 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.
From Ballinderry, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, Muldoon announced his retirement from playing club football for Ballinderry Shamrocks on 13 November 2017. He was instrumental in helping Ballinderry win the 2002 All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship, and he has also won six Derry Championships and an Ulster Senior Club Football Championship with the club.
Muldoon was a versatile player who could play anywhere in the forward line or in midfield. Described by Joe Brolly as "the greatest ever natural talent to have played with Derry", his repertoire of skills include his catching ability, scoring prowess, confidence on the ball, positional awareness and in particular his great passing capabilities.
Despite often playing in the half-forward line or midfield, Muldoon has consistently been a high scorer for Derry. He finished the 2001 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship with 2–10 (16) and the 2004 Championship with 3–24 (33). He finished the 2006 campaign with 1-07 (10) from two matches. His tally of 12 Championship goals is one of the highest ever in Ulster football history.
Football career.
Playing style.
Described as "one of the most talented footballers of his generation", Enda Muldoon has played in virtually all positions in the forward line, as well as midfield for both his club and county. He is regarded as the complete footballer in that he has impressive high-fielding skills, is hard to dispossess, is very accurate in front of the posts with both feet and covers a lot of ground often tracking back to help in defence. Muldoon has been praised for his vision and ability to pick out pin-point passes, and he is also regarded as a great reader of the game. Ballinderry and Derry teammate Kevin McGuckin described him as "a magician on the ball and can do anything with it or put it anywhere with his passing". GAA journalist and former Derry player Joe Brolly said of him: "I cannot say I have ever seen a more elegant footballer" and compared him to Kerry football legend Maurice Fitzgerald.
Inter-county.
In 1995, his last year of eligibility, Muldoon was brought into the Derry Minor panel. He was part of the team that won the 1995 Ulster Minor Championship and finished runners-up to Westmeath in that year's All-Ireland Minor final. He was instrumental in Derry's run in that Minor Championship, including scoring 1–07 (10) against Down in the Ulster final and scoring a dramatic last minute goal which helped Derry beat Galway by a point in the All-Ireland semi-final.
Muldoon reached the Ulster Under-21 Football Championship final with Derry Under-21s in 1996, but were defeated by Cavan. In 1997 Muldoon and Derry won the Ulster Under-21 and All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championships, defeating Fermanagh and Meath in the respective finals. Muldoon was also on the team the following year, but Derry were defeated at the Ulster final stage by Armagh.
He made his Derry Senior debut in the 1997 season and reached the Ulster final, where they were beat by Cavan. In 1998, playing in midfield he won the Ulster Senior Championship with Derry. It was his sixth Ulster final in four years—one Minor, three Under-21 and two Senior. Derry lost out to Galway in that year's All-Ireland Championship semi-final. In 2000 he won the National League with Derry, defeating Meath in the final. Derry also reached that year's Ulster final, but lost out to Armagh. He was nominated in 2000 for an All Star, but narrowly missed out. He was however an All Star replacement for the All Star trip to Dubai in January 2001.
Derry lost at the semi-final stage of the 2001 Ulster Championship, but nonetheless reached the All-Ireland semi-final through the qualifiers, where they once again faced Galway. Derry again lost to Galway, despite a goal scored by Muldoon. Muldoon scored 2–10 (16) in that year's Championship. Muldoon was named Derry captain for the 2003 season.
In 2004 Muldoon and Paddy Bradley formed a clinical scoring partnership en route to the All-Ireland semi-final, where they eventually lost to Kerry. Muldoon contributed 3–24 (33) of Derry's total of 7–92 (113) in the 2004 All-Ireland Championship, including a goal in the semi-final and 1-06 (9) in the quarter-final in a man of the match performance against Westmeath. He was named full forward on the 2004 All-Star team for his performances the Championship.
Muldoon had an injury called patellar tendinitis in both his knees. In December 2004, he underwent surgery on one of his knees. The operation was successful and he resumed training in April 2005. Muldoon started the 2006 Ulster Championship campaign very brightly scoring 1–03 (6) in the first round of the Ulster Championship against defending All-Ireland Champions Tyrone and 0–04 against Donegal. However Muldoon, with a previously exemplary disciplinary record at all levels, was red-carded late in that game. Some commentators called for Muldoon's red card to be rescinded after television replays showed he was reacting to "extreme provocation" from Donegal full back Paddy Campbell, who had punched Muldoon in the groin. Muldoon however received a four-week suspension and missed Derry's next two games against Kildare and Longford. Longford produced a shock victory to knock Derry out of the 2006 Championship. He finished the 2006 campaign with 1-07 (10) from two matches.
Muldoon put in some impressive performances in Derry's run to the 2007 All-Ireland quarter-final, where they lost out to Dublin. He was awarded the Ulster Tennent's Monthly Merit Award for July 2007, for his performances against Mayo and Laois that month, including a lobbed goal against Mayo. This was the second time he had received the accolade. He was instrumental in the 2008 National League, which Derry won, defeating Kerry in the final. Joe Brolly described him as "the best player on the field". The league success saw Derry become favourites to win the Ulster Championship and one of the top few for the All-Ireland. However, despite a good opening victory against Donegal, Derry exited the Ulster Championship against Fermanagh at the semi-final stage and were defeated by Monaghan in the first round of the Qualifiers.
Muldoon and Derry also reached the National League final in 2009, but were defeated by Kerry. He missed the final due to injury. Muldoon won a second McKenna Cup medal with Derry in 2011. They also reached that year's Ulster final but lost to Donegal.
Club.
Muldoon won his first Derry Senior Football Championship medal while still a minor in 1995, when Ballinderry defeated Bellaghy in the final. In 1998 Muldoon was part of the Ballinderry team that won the All-Ireland Kilmacud Crokes Sevens Championship.
After losing two finals in a row to Bellaghy in 1999 and 2000, Ballinderry won the 2001 Derry Championship, once again defeating Bellaghy in the decider. The club went on to win the 2001 Ulster Club Championship with victories over St. Gall's in the quarter-final (after a replay), Cavan Gaels in the semi-final and Mayobridge in the final. Muldoon was awarded Ulster Football Award Winner at the AIB GAA Provincial Player Awards 2001 for his role in Ballinderry's march to claim the Ulster Club Championship. He was presented his award by GAA President Seán McCague. Ballinderry went on to represent Ulster in the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship, which they won defeating Tír Chonaill Gaels (London) in the quarter-final, Rathnew (Wicklow) in the semi-final and Nemo Rangers (Cork) in the final. Muldoon played through the pain barrier in the Championship, delaying an operation on a troublesome hip injury until after the All-Ireland final.
Ballinderry defended the Derry Championship in 2002, but lost in the semi-final stage of the Ulster Club Championship to Errigal Ciarán. Muldoon won the Ulster Tennent's Monthly Merit Award for October 2002 for his performance against Mayobridge in the Ulster Club quarter-final. His performance in that game was described as a "masterful display", scoring vital points and was the "defensive anchor in a tense final quarter". Muldoon also helped New York club Westmeath reach the semi-final of the New York Senior Football Championship in 2002, but they were defeated by the Kerry club.
Muldoon was runner-up for the third time in the Derry Championship in 2003, losing to local rivals An Lúb in the final. He gained his fourth Derry Championship medal in 2006 with the club, avenging the 2003 loss to An Lúb, with Muldoon having an "impressive game". Ballinderry reached the 2006 Ulster Club final, but lost narrowly to Crossmaglen Rangers. In 2008 Muldoon and Ballinderry won the Ulster Senior Club Football League. Muldoon won his fifth Derry Championship medal in 2008, this time as captain. An achilles injury forced him to miss the quarter-final tie with Bellaghy and he was only fit enough to come on as a substitute in the semi-final clash with Dungiven. However he recovered in time for the final, and his performance, particularly in the second half, proved vital in helping the club defeat Slaughtneil. Ballinderry got to the 2008 Ulster Club final and again faced Crossmaglen. Muldoon put in a brilliant performance in the game, which finished a draw. He broke a bone in his foot two days before the replay and could not play. His absence proved costly and Cross won the replay.
Coleraine defeated Ballinderry in the 2010 Derry Championship final, but Muldoon won his sixth county medal in 2011 with victory over Kilrea in the final. The Shamroks also won the 2010 and 2011 Ulster League titles. He has also won eight Derry Senior League medals with the club (1995, 1996, 1997, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010).
Province.
Muldoon has played for Ulster many times. He was part of the panel in 2000, that won the Railway Cup, but could not play due to an injury picked up in training. He also won the competition with the province in 2003, 2004 and 2007.

U.S. Route 33 in Virginia

U.S. Route 33 (US 33) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from Elkhart, Indiana to Richmond, Virginia. In Virginia, the U.S. Highway runs from the West Virginia state line near Rawley Springs east to its eastern terminus at SR 33 in Richmond. US 33 is the primary east–west highway of Rockingham County, which lies in the Shenandoah Valley. The highway connects the independent city of Harrisonburg (which also serves as the seat of Rockingham County), the town of Elkton, and an entrance to Shenandoah National Park. East of the Blue Ridge Mountains, US 33 connects the Piedmont communities of Stanardsville, Gordonsville, and Louisa. The U.S. Highway is a major suburban and urban route in the Richmond metropolitan area. Within Richmond, US 33 runs concurrently with US 250. SR 33 continues from US 33's eastern terminus as a state-numbered extension of the U.S. Highway that connects Richmond with Virginia's Middle Peninsula.
Route description.
Allegheny Mountains.
US 33 enters Virginia at about elevation at Dry River Gap on top of Shenandoah Mountain at the West Virginia state line, having climbed steeply from the community of Brandywine, West Virginia, in the valley of the South Fork of the South Branch of the Potomac River. US 33 then heads east as Rawley Pike, with a curvaceous descent to the narrow but flat valley of the Dry River, which the highway follows east through the George Washington National Forest. East of Rawley Springs, the highway veers away from the river, leaves the national forest, and passes through a low, wide gap in Great North Mountain to enter the Shenandoah Valley.
Shenandoah Valley.
Once in the Shenandoah Valley, US 33 passes through the hamlets of Hinton and Dale Enterprise, then passes to the north of Mole Hill before entering the independent city of Harrisonburg.
US 33 continues into Harrisonburg as Market Street, a four-lane divided highway. The road becomes an undivided highway and then reduces to two lanes at its intersection with SR 42 (High Street) in downtown Harrisonburg, after which the highway intersects a branch of the Norfolk Southern Railway's Roanoke District at grade. US 33 meets the southbound direction of US 11 (Liberty Street), then splits to pass along a two-lane, one-way street surrounding Court Square, the site of the Rockingham County courthouse. The eastern side of the square, Main Street, is followed by northbound US 11. Both directions of US 33 therefore have short but separate concurrencies with each direction of US 11 around the Courthouse, before US 33 exits the downtown Harrisonburg area as Market Street.
US 33 expands to four lanes at Mason Street, then curves south and becomes a divided highway at Vine Street. The highway passes over the Norfolk Southern Railway's Roanoke District rail line, then intersects with I-81. After I-81, US 33 expands to six lanes, passing through a commercial area that includes the Harrisonburg Crossing shopping center and the Valley Mall. Eastward, the route returns to a four-lane highway, and is named Spotswood Trail at the city limits of Harrisonburg. US 33 meets the northern end of SR 276 (Cross Keys Road) in Penn Laird as the highway makes a broad curve around the southern end of Massanutten Mountain, within which is the Massanutten Resort. The highway crosses the Norfolk Southern rail line again and passes through McGaheysville, at the base of Massanutten Mountain, continuing to Elkton at the southern edge of the Page Valley.
West of Elkton, US 33 Business (Old Spotswood Trail) splits to the north. US 33 then crosses the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, enters the town limits, and crosses over the Norfolk Southern rail line for the last time. The highway leaves the town at US 340 (East Side Highway) and the east end of US 33 Business. The route then follows West Swift Run southeast to the hamlet of Swift Run, after which it reduces to two lanes and begins a curvaceous ascent of the Blue Ridge, cresting the mountain at Swift Run Gap at an elevation of , where the highway crosses the Appalachian Trail and has an intersection with the access road to the Skyline Drive, the north–south highway through Shenandoah National Park, then descending to the Virginia Piedmont.
Piedmont.
After cresting the Blue Ridge, US 33 enters Greene County and has a more gentle descent of the eastern side of the mountain, where the highway follows Swift Run to the hamlet of Lydia, then passes around the north side of Powell Mountain and meets the stream again west of Stanardsville, where the road expands to a four-lane divided highway. US 33 Business (Spotswood Trail) splits to the north to pass through the center of Stanardsville, the county seat of Greene County, while US 33 follows the Stanardsville Bypass. US 33 Business provides access to SR 230, which heads toward Madison. US 33 continues southeast through Quinque and intersects US 29 (Seminole Trail) in Ruckersville.
East of US 29, US 33 reduces to two lanes and enters Orange County. The highway has a short concurrency with SR 20 (Constitution Highway) through Barboursville, where both highways pass under the Norfolk Southern Railway's Washington District rail line. US 33 passes through a gap in the Southwest Mountains before reaching Gordonsville. At the town limit, the U.S. Highway has an intersection with SR 231 (Blue Ridge Turnpike). US 33 and SR 231 run together a short distance east to the Gordonsville Roundabout, where SR 231 heads southwest as Gordon Avenue toward Cismont and US 33 becomes concurrent with US 15 (James Madison Highway) along Main Street. The two highways pass the Exchange Hotel at their underpass of the Washington Subdivision, the Charlottesville–Orange rail line owned by the Buckingham Branch Railroad. At the southern edge of downtown Gordonsville, US 33 and US 15 leave Main Street and veer onto Martinsburg Avenue, which follows CSX's Piedmont Subdivision to the southern limit of Gordonsville, where the highways enter Louisa County.
US 15 continues south as the James Madison Highway toward Farmville, while US 33 continues paralleling the railroad along Spotswood Trail. At Trevilians, US 33 becomes concurrent with SR 22 (Louisa Road). US 33 and SR 22 head into the town of Louisa as Main Street. On the east side of this county seat, the highways intersect SR 208 (Courthouse Road). SR 208 joins the two highways for a short distance until the state highways diverge from US 33, following the railroad east along Davis Highway toward Mineral, near the epicenter of the 2011 Virginia earthquake, with US 33 continuing southeast along Jefferson Highway. The route passes south of Northeast Creek Reservoir before a short concurrency with US 522 in Cuckoo, where US 522 heads north as Pendleton Road toward Mineral and south as Cross County Highway toward Goochland. Continuing eastward, US 33 then approaches the Richmond Metropolitan Area.

Continuing eastward across the Piedmont, US 33 heads southeast into Hanover County, where the highway is named Mountain Road. The route then passes through the village of Montpelier, after which it meets the western end of SR 54 (Patrick Henry Road). US 33 crosses the South Anna River at Ground Squirrel Bridge northwest of Farrington, then expands to a four-lane divided highway just north of the Chickahominy River, where the highway enters Henrico County and becomes Staples Mill Road. It then intersects I-295, then meets the northern end of SR 157 (Springfield Road) in the Richmond suburb of Glen Allen.
In the community of Laurel, US 33 expands to six lanes at its intersection with Parham Road north of the Richmond Staples Mill Road Amtrak station. In Dumbarton, US 33 meets the western end of SR 356 (Hilliard Road) and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-64 with a flyover ramp from westbound I-64 to eastbound US 33.
US 33 enters Richmond, an independent city, just before the highway meets US 250 (Broad Street) near The Shops at Willow Lawn. US 33 and US 250 continue together southeast along this six-lane boulevard toward downtown Richmond. Broad Street also carries the GRTC Pulse bus rapid transit line. The two highways parallel the city line to SR 197 (Malvern Avenue), then pass over I-195 with no direct access. US 33 and US 250 intersect SR 161 (Arthur Ashe Boulevard) northwest of the Science Museum of Virginia, in the former Broad Street railroad station. US 33 and US 250 split just east of the Siegel Center, home of the Virginia Commonwealth University Rams basketball teams, with US 250 continuing on Broad Street, while US 33 turns north onto Hancock Street. The federally numbered highway reaches its eastern terminus at Leigh Street, where it becomes Virginia SR 33.

John Burnham Schwartz

John Burnham Schwartz (born 1965) is an American novelist and screenwriter. Schwartz is best known for his novels "Reservation Road" (1998) and "The Commoner" (2008). His fifth novel, "Northwest Corner", a sequel to "Reservation Road", was published in 2011. He is an editor at large at Penguin Random House.
Career.
John Burnham Schwartz was born in 1965, in New York City, the son of Alan U. Schwartz, an entertainment attorney, and Paula Schwartz (née Dunaway), an editor and writer. Schwartz's parents later apparently divorced; in 1983 his mother married the poet W. S. Merwin, and was known as Paula Merwin.
Growing up in New York City, Schwartz attended the Manhattan Country School. He later attended Harvard College, where he majored in Japanese studies. After graduating in 1987, with a B.A. in East Asian Studies, he initially accepted a position with a Wall Street investment bank, before finally turning the position down, after selling his first novel. That book, "Bicycle Days", a coming of age story about a young American man in Japan, was published in 1989 on his 24th birthday, and garnered strong reviews. In 1991 he was a recipient of a Lyndhurst Foundation Award.
Schwartz's second novel "Reservation Road" (1998), about a family tragedy and its aftermath, was critically acclaimed, and in 2007 was made into a major motion picture. The film, starring Joaquin Phoenix, Mark Ruffalo, and Jennifer Connelly, was directed by Terry George, based on a screenplay that was co-written by Schwartz and George.
Schwartz went on to publish "Claire Marvel" (2002), a love story set in the United States and France, and, in 2008, "The Commoner", a novel inspired by the life of Empress Michiko of Japan, the current empress and crown princess of Japan, and the first commoner to marry into the Japanese imperial family.
He was a co-writer, with Sam Levinson and Samuel Baum, of the screenplay for "The Wizard of Lies", a 2017 HBO movie about the disgraced financier Bernie Madoff, based on the non-fiction book of the same title by Diana B. Henriques; the screenplay was a 2018 nominee for a Writers Guild of America Award, for an adapted long-form program.
Schwartz has contributed articles to publications including "The New Yorker", "The New York Times Book Review", "The Boston Globe", and "Vogue". He has taught at Harvard, the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, and Sarah Lawrence College. He is the Literary Director of the Sun Valley Writers' Conference, based in Ketchum, Idaho.

 Francis Badgley (14 June 1807 – 24 December 1863) was the son of Francis Badgley (1767–1841), a merchant with business connections to the London, England, fur trade. The senior Badgley had made his start in Canada as a partner of Richard Dobie. His brother, William became a judge and attorney general for Canada East.
Francis was licensed to practice in 1826 and, after receiving his diploma from the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and his MD from the University of Edinburgh in 1829, he finished his studies in Europe. He then practiced in England until returning to Montreal in 1843. Upon his return, he concentrated mainly on teaching medicine and in 1843 was instrumental in setting up the Montreal School of Medicine and Surgery, later to become the Université de Montréal Faculty of Medicine. He was also involved in setting up the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada. This organization received government recognition in 1847.
Francis Badgley continued to teach medicine in Canada until 1860. At that time he was on the medical faculty of the University of Trinity College in Toronto. He returned to England that year because of his wife's health and remained there in practice until his death.

Óscar López (footballer, born 1980)

Óscar López Hernández (born 11 May 1980) is a Spanish retired footballer who played mainly as a left-back, currently a manager.
His professional career, started with Barcelona, was marred by injuries.
Club career.
Born in Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Catalonia, López was a product of the Barcelona "cantera". He appeared for the club's C and B sides, being given his senior debut by Radomir Antić in a 3–1 win against Recreativo de Huelva on 25 May 2003 and adding a further seven La Liga games over the course of that and the following seasons. His first taste of European football came on 15 October 2003, in an 8–0 rout of Matador Púchov in the UEFA Cup.
However, López failed to establish himself in the main squad, and was subsequently loaned to Lazio for 2004–05. He made 14 Serie A appearances, played twice in the Coppa Italia and four times in the UEFA Cup, but struggled to earn a regular starting position, and the Romans decided against buying the player at the end of the campaign.
López returned to Spain on 3 August 2005 after being loaned to Real Betis, making his debut in the 2–1 victory over Barcelona in the second leg of the Supercopa de España. He managed to be relatively used during the season, with 27 competitive matches – featuring in two European competitions – and, after that, signed a permanent four-year contract.
In January 2007, López was loaned to top-flight strugglers Gimnàstic de Tarragona for five months, where he sustained a serious knee injury that sidelined him for several months, although the move was extended for 2007–08. Upon his return to Andalusia in July 2008, he was told to look for a new team; unable to do so, he spent the following year training with the club, although not registered at all.
On 4 February 2010, being completely ostracised at Betis, López was finally allowed to leave and joined Numancia of Segunda División. He scored his only goal as a professional in his country on 16 May in a 1–1 home draw against Rayo Vallecano, as the Sorians eventually failed to return to the top tier; in June 2011, aged 31, he was released.
López moved to Go Ahead Eagles in the Dutch Eerste Divisie on 23 December 2011, on a deal until June 2012 with an option for an additional year. After retiring, he returned to the Camp Nou as a youth manager.

Frederick F. Russell

Brigadier General Frederick Fuller Russell (1870 – December 29, 1960) was a U.S. Army physician who perfected a typhoid vaccine in 1909. In 1911, a typhoid vaccination program was carried out to have the entire U.S. Army immunized. As a direct result of his research, the U.S. Army was the first military to make vaccination a required prophylaxis against typhoid. The 1911 measure eliminated typhoid as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among U.S. military personnel.
Biography.
Russell was born in Auburn, New York in 1870. After graduating from Cornell University in 1891, Russell received his Doctor of Medicine from Columbia University in 1893 and his Doctor of Science from George Washington University in 1917. In 1898, he was commissioned as first lieutenant in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army.
It was during his time as a Medical Corps officer that he began his research into the inoculation of soldiers against typhoid. In 1908, Surgeon General O'Reilly sent Russell to England to observe the work of Sir Almroth Wright, Professor at the Royal Army Medical College, who had been experimenting with a method of prophylaxis with killed culture of typhoid organisms to immunize against the disease. Upon Russell's return, he submitted a report on Wright's research, which O'Reilly considered "a very valuable treatise on the epidemiology of this disease". He conducted trials at the Army Medical Museum comparing the efficacy of both an orally administered and an injected vaccine. He packed the vaccine in small single dosage using small glass ampoules which, unlike the 1 liter flasks used in the United Kingdom, ensured that all of the typhoid micro-organisms were killed.
As a result of the report, Russell was assigned the duty of implementing an immunization program within the U.S. Army. In 1910 he inoculated his first group of volunteers and by 1911 vaccination became compulsory. From a morbidity of 173 cases in 1910, Russell was able to reduce the total to nine cases in 1912 with only one death.
During his career he served as curator of the Army Medical Museum from 1907 to 1911, instructor in the Army Medical School, and professor of pathology and bacteriology at George Washington University. In addition, he served on various investigating boards, one of which he was able to advise and offer technical counsel to Major Carl Darnall in the development of a water filter for field use and the first water chlorinator using gaseous chlorine.
After his resignation from the Army in 1921, Russell returned to the rolls as a reserve officer and in November 1920 was appointed Brigadier General of the Medical Officers Reserve Corps. Following his military career he served as the director of the International Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation. As director, Russell continued his research into public health focusing on diseases such as yellow fever. In 1935 he was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. He spent the final years (1936–39) of his career in medical science and administration as professor of epidemiology and preventive medicine at Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health. In 1942, he was presented with the Gorgas Medal from the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States (AMSUS).

Japanese-American Claims Act

The Japanese-American Claims Act is a law passed by the United States Congress and signed by President Harry S. Truman on July 2, 1948. The law authorized the settlement of property loss claims by people of Japanese descent who were removed from the Pacific Coast area during World War II. According to a Senate report on the Act, there were concerns about whether the United States government had the right to evacuate and place all people of Japanese ancestry in internment camps. As result of being placed in the Japanese internment camps there was great loss of property, belongings, business, "and the principles of justice and responsible government require that there should be compensation for such losses. "Congress over time appropriated $38 million to settle 23,000 claims for damages totaling $131 million. The final claim was adjudicated in 1965."
History.
The attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise air strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy on the neutral United States in Oahu, Hawaii—with the focus being directed against the naval base at Pearl Harbor—on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack sank four U.S. battleships, destroyed 188 U.S. aircraft, and killed nearly 2,500 people, leading to the United States joining World War II the next day. Once the United States entered the war and anti-Japanese sentiment began to circulate, Americans increasingly reacted with racism and hostility, viewing people of Japanese descent as enemies regardless of U.S. citizenship. The U.S. government expressed concerns about the loyalty of the Japanese people living in America and about Japanese spies sending information to Japan. As a result, the Treasury Department froze the assets of all citizens and resident aliens who were born in Japan, and the Department of Justice arrested some 1,500 religious and community leaders as potentially dangerous enemy aliens. The chief concern among military and political leaders was due to the fact many of the largest populations of Japanese Americans were in close proximity to vital war assets along the Pacific Coast. 
In response to the public fears, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. The order "granted the secretary of war and his commanders the power "to prescribe military areas in such places and of such extent as he or the appropriate Military Commander may determine, from which any or all persons may be excluded." While no specific group or location was mentioned in the order, it was quickly applied to virtually the entire Japanese American population on the West Coast."
Once Executive Order 9066 was issued all people of Japanese descent in the Western Defense Command were evacuated from their homes, forcibly relocated, and confined to relocation and then internment camps. They were only allowed to take what they could carry with them and were not told where they were going or how long they would be gone. By June, more than 110,000 Japanese Americans were relocated to remote internment camps built by the U.S. military in scattered locations around the country. For the next two and a half years, many of these Japanese Americans endured extremely difficult living conditions and poor treatment by their military guards.
During World War II, U.S. Major General Henry C. Pratt issues Public Proclamation No. 21, declaring that, effective January 2, 1945, Japanese American "evacuees" from the West Coast could return to their homes. In December 1944, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Ex parte Mitsuye Endo that it was beyond the power of the War Relocation Authority "to detain citizens against whom no charges of disloyalty or subversiveness have been made for a period longer than that necessary to separate the loyal from the disloyal." 
In 1948, President Harry S. Truman signed the Evacuation Claims Act, which gave internees the opportunity to submit claims for property lost as a result of relocation.
Claims Act of 1948.
Following is the text of the Claims Act of 1948:
"That no amount received as an award under the Act entitled "An Act to authorize the Attorney General to adjudicate certain claims resulting from evacuation of certain persons of Japanese ancestry under military orders", approved July 2, 1948. As amended by Public Law 116 Eighty-second Congress, and Public Law 673, Eighty-fourth Congress (50U.S.6.App. sees.1981-1987), shall be included in gross income for purposes of chapter the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954."
"SEC.2. The first section of this Act shall apply with respect to taxable year sending after July 2, 1948. If refund or credit of any over payment of Federal income tax resulting from the application of the first section of this Act (Including interest, additions to the tax, additional amounts, and penalties) is prevented on the date of the enactment of this Act, or within one year from such date, by the operation of any law or rule of law, the refund or credit of such over payment may nevertheless be made or allowed if claim there for is filed within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act. In the case of a claim to which the preceding sentence applies the amount to be refunded or credited as an overpayment shall not be diminished by any creditor set-off based upon any item other than the amount of the award referred to in the first section of this Act. No interest shall be allowed or paid on any overpayment resulting from the application of this Act."
Amendments.
The Claims Act of 1948 was amended on June 5, 1956. "The purpose of the amendments is to establish $100,000 as the maximum award which the Attorney General may make in the compromise and settlement of a claim under the Japanese-American Evacuation Claims Act of 1948 without submission of a claim of the Court of Claims."
Claims.
Many former Japanese American internees had lost their property and their homes during internment; they had no place to go home to and had only a handful of belongings. The Claims Act was set up to help these people after release from the camps but it had its flaws. The processing of the claims took time and many of these people had nothing and were in urgent need of money for shelter and food after the camps closed. "JAPANESE-AMERICAN EVACUATION CLAIMS ACT OF 1948 the proposed legislation would confer jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims to determine any claim timely filed under the act. A petition to the court for such determination could be filed at any time except that it could not be filed more than 90 days after the date of a notice by the Attorney General served on the claimant by registered mail that no further consideration would be given to the compromise of the claim." An example of such involves a claim filed by Toshi Shimomaye, who was forced to sell several possessions to the highest bidder that resulted in a net loss of several hundred dollars.

Wat Bowonniwet Vihara

Wat Bowaniwet Wihan Ratchaworawihan (; , ) is a major Buddhist temple ("wat") in Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok, Thailand. Being the residence of Nyanasamvara Suvaddhana, the late Supreme Patriarch of Thailand, it is the final resting place of two former kings of Chakri Dynasty: King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) and King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX). The temple was established in 1824 by Mahasakti Pol Sep, viceroy during the reign of King Rama III (r. 1824–51).
The temple is a center of the Thammayut Nikaya order of Thai Theravada Buddhism, it is the shrine-hall of "Phra Phuttha Chinnasi" (พระพุทธชินสีห์), a statue of the Buddha which dates to around 1357. Bowonniwet has been a major temple of patronage for the ruling Chakri dynasty. It is where many royal princes and kings studied and served their monkhood, including King Bhumibol and his son, the present king Vajiralongkorn.
Architecture.
The golden "chedi" at the "wat"s shrine carries the relics and ashes of Thai royals. The two "viharas" are closed to public. The T-shaped "bot" holds a magnificent Sukhothai-period Buddha, cast in 1257 CE to celebrate freedom from the Khmers.
The murals on the "bot"s interior walls were traditionally light and limited in their subject matter and style. They were painted to appear three-dimensional. Monk artist Khrua In Khong introduced Western style in the murals depicting Buddhist subjects.
Royal patronage and history.
In 1836, Prince Bhikkhu Mongkut (ordination name: "Vajirañāṇo") arrived at the temple and became its first abbot, founding the Thammayut Nikkaya order. He stayed at the temple for 27 years before acceding the throne of Siam as King Rama IV.
His great-grandson, King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX; ordination name: "Bhumibalo"), was ordained a monk at Wat Phra Kaew, and resided in Bowonniwet for 15 days in 1956. Bhumibol's mentor, Somdet Phra Yanasangworn, eventually became abbot of the temple, and later the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand. In 1978, King Bhumibol's son, King Vajiralongkorn (Rama X; ordination name: "Vajirālankaraṇo"), was also ordained and spent 15 days at Bowonniwet. Several of his sons from his second wife, Yuvadhida Polpraserth, later did the same.
In October 1976, exiled dictator and former Prime Minister, Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn, returned to Thailand as a novice monk to enter Bowonniwet. This sparked large public demonstrations and a bloody crackdown that became known as the Thammasat University massacre or the "6 October Event".

Stan Wentzel

Stanley Aaron Wentzel (January 13, 1917 – November 28, 1991) was an American professional baseball player. A longtime minor league outfielder and, later, a manager, Wentzel's only stint in Major League Baseball came at the end of the season, when he appeared in four games in centerfield for the Boston Braves. The 28-year-old rookie was a native of Lorane, Pennsylvania. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .
Wentzel is one of many ball players who only appeared in the Major Leagues during the World War II period. After batting .321 with the Indianapolis Indians of the top-level American Association — where he was named an All-Star and the league's Most Valuable Player — he was called up by Boston and started four games for the Braves in the last week of the season, all against the New York Giants. He got only four hits in 19 at bats (.211), but had six runs batted in. He also scored three runs. In the field, Wentzel recorded eight putouts with no errors.
Wentzel returned to Indianapolis for and after that season, on September 30, he was included in a multiplayer trade that sent him to the Pittsburgh Pirates with future Hall of Fame second baseman Billy Herman, pitcher Elmer Singleton and infielder Whitey Wietelmann for third baseman Bob Elliott and catcher Hank Camelli. Herman was promptly named playing manager of the 1947 Pirates, but he was aghast at the cost — Elliott — the Pirates had paid for him. "Why, they've gone and traded the whole team on me", he said. Elliott would win the National League Most Valuable Player award and lead Boston to the 1948 National League pennant. Herman's 1947 Pirates lost 92 games and finished tied for seventh in the NL, and he resigned before the season's final game.
Wentzel never appeared in a game for the Pirates, but he played and managed in the Pittsburgh farm system through 1958. He died at the age of 74 in St. Lawrence, Pennsylvania.

Decrement table

Decrement tables, also called life table methods, are used to calculate the probability of certain events.
Birth control.
Life table methods are often used to study birth control effectiveness. In this role, they are an alternative to the Pearl Index.
As used in birth control studies, a decrement table calculates a separate effectiveness rate for each month of the study, as well as for a standard period of time (usually 12 months). Use of life table methods eliminates time-related biases (i.e. the most fertile couples getting pregnant and dropping out of the study early, and couples becoming more skilled at using the method as time goes on), and in this way is superior to the Pearl Index.
Two kinds of decrement tables are used to evaluate birth control methods. Multiple-decrement (or competing) tables report net effectiveness rates. These are useful for comparing competing reasons for couples dropping out of a study. Single-decrement (or noncompeting) tables report gross effectiveness rates, which can be used to accurately compare one study to another.

<doc id="7008750" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7008750" title="Sportal">
Sportal

Sportal was a company of the dotcom boom at the end of the 1990s. Founded by Rob Hersov, and backed by BSkyB and Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest among others, the company, originally called Pangolin, acquired rights to host a many official websites of Europe's leading football clubs (including Real Madrid, Juventus, AC Milan and Bayern Munich) as well as lower-profile sites across a number of other sports. It also opened offices across Europe, in South Africa, and in Australia and at its peak employed over 300 people.
In December 1999 it was valued at $170 million, and in the summer of 2000 it was named as the "Sunday Times's" #1 web company at the same time it ran the website for Euro 2000. 
In the summer of 2000 Hersov was weeks away from selling the company to Vivendi Universal for £270m when market sentiment changed and the talks collapsed. Despite this, The Sunday Times named Sportal the No.1 e-business in the UK and it came out top in an e-league compiled by the web consultancy, Bathwick. But as the dot.com bubble burst, Sportal's size and lack of strong income streams quickly started to cause problems.
By March 2001 the company was in trouble and two rounds of redundancies saw two thirds of the staff laid off and savage spending cuts implemented. In April Hersov admitted Sportal was on the verge of closure if it did not secure more funding. Hersov injected his own money to keep the company afloat but even that did not arrest the slide.
In November 2001, UKbetting bought Sportal's domain names and trademark for £1 - marking the end of Sportal as a consumer website. It paid another £190,000 for the company's technology and took on two of Sportal's remaining 70 staff. The brand initially continued as sports content site then in 2002 relaunched the brand as a multi-sports broadband video portal sportal.com. 
In 2008, Sportal also opened its office in Mumbai and their Indian-centric website, www.sportal.co.in, was launched in November 2010.

Lucrezia Orsina Vizzana

Lucrezia Orsina Vizzana (also "Lucretia") (3 July 1590 – 7 May 1662) was an Italian singer, organist, and composer. She entered the Camaldolese convent of Santa Christina in Bologna in 1598. She was taught by her aunt, Camilla Bombacci, who was the convent organist, and by Ottavio Vernizzi, who was the unofficial music master. Vizzana's works are influenced by "stile moderno" ("seconda prattica") music, especially the works of Claudio Monteverdi.
Biography and works.
Lucrezia Orsina Vizzana was born on July 3, 1590 in Bologna, Italy to Ludovico Vizzana and Isabetta Bombacci. She entered the Camaldolese convent of Santa Christina in 1598 following her mother's death and adopted the religious name Donna Lucrezia Orsina (or Ursula), where it is believed she learned music from her aunt, Camilla Bombacci, the convent organist, and Ottavio Vernizzi, unofficial music director of the convent. 
Vizzana's motets were published in "Componimenti musicali de motetti concertati a l e più voci" in 1623, the only collection of music ever published by a Bolognese nun. There are ten solo motets, eight duets, one trio, and one quartet all with continuo. The works feature other characteristics of the "stile moderno." Furthermore, many convents used motets for double choir as a way of exploiting the musical gifts of the nuns in reaction to the decree from the Council of Trent that nuns must be confined within a convent, although Vizzana’s publications did not include works for double choir. Vizzana's "O invictissima Christi martir," along with "Sonet vox tua in auribus cordis mei"; "Usquequo oblivisceris me in finem"; "O magnum mysterium"; "Ornaverunt faciem templi"; "Domine Dominus noster, quam admirabile"; and "Protector noster" can all be found in Martha Furman Schleifer and Sylvia Glickman's "Women Composers: Music through the Ages." However, Vizzana's music also reflects a much older practice of female spirituality stretching back to the later Middle Ages as opposed to the new post-Tridentine religious traditions for women. Most of her motets were created for feast days, reflecting many liturgical, artistic, and devotional moments in convent life. However, other motets allude to the inner strife in the convent and its decline from 1620 onward.
In 1622, an anonymous letter was sent to the Cardinal Archbishop Ludovico Ludovisi in Rome reporting many scandals and issues in the convent, especially the issue of conflict within the convent. These allegations were followed by a long investigation of the convent that caused much inner strife amongst the nuns. It was revealed that much of the inquietude and rivalries amongst the nuns resulted from the musical life of the convent. It is often believed that the stress of the turmoil led to Vizzana's early retirement from music and mental instability.

Miu Miu

Miu Miu is an Italian high fashion women's clothing and accessory brand and a fully owned subsidiary of Prada. It is headed by Miuccia Prada and headquartered in Milan, Italy.
Silvia Onofri is its CEO.
History.
Miu Miu was established in 1992 by Miuccia Prada. The name was conceived from Miuccia Prada's family nickname. It was publicly launched in 1993, with a cowgirl-themed collection of fringed suede jackets and patchwork prairie skirts. Starting in 1994, the brand showed its collections in the US for three seasons. It first showed a womenswear collection during Paris Fashion Week in 2006.
By 2005, Prada worked on distinguishing Miu Miu by setting up a separate showroom for the brand in an Art Nouveau villa that served as Prada’s first Milan headquarters, and using that same location for the men’s fall-winter show in 2006.
In 2020, Miu Miu introduced Upcycled by Miu Miu, a limited collection of vintage dresses from the 1930s through the 1980s that have been tweaked and refashioned. The collection continues to be a major focus for the brand today.
Miu Miu’s Spring 2024 show was chosen as the 'best of the year' at the Impression Awards 2024. In the 2020's, Miu Miu has experienced a renewed interest from a younger customer. 2023 full year sales figures were up by 82% year-over-year.
Other activities.
Under an agreement made with Prada, the production and global distribution of Miu Miu's prescription frames and sunglasses have been licensed to Luxottica since 2003.
Backed by a 2013 agreement, between Coty and Prada, Miu Miu launched its first fragrance in 2015, marking the first time the brand expanded outside the fashion and accessories markets.
Boutiques.
There are Miu Miu boutiques located on a global scale. Architect Roberto Baciocchi developed the blueprint for an early series of stores, which was first applied to the Milan store in 2006. He also created the interiors for Miu Miu stores in Paris, Hong Kong, Florence, London, New York and Taipei.
Miu Miu opened its first independent store in China in The Mixc in Shenzhen in 2009. A new North American store was launched in Houston, Texas, in The Galleria during the summer of 2011 and in Short Hills, New Jersey, in the fall of 2011. Miu Miu also opened their first Australian boutique at Chadstone Shopping Centre in Melbourne. A branch opened in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2010 and is situated in the Fraser's department store. A store designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron opened in the Aoyama district of Tokyo in 2015.
In 2017, the Miu Miu Sloane Street store in London reopened after a refurbishment, and announced that they would be starting a customisation service to allow customers to design their own heels. It is the only Miu Miu store in the world to offer this service. In 2025, Miu Miu reopened in London with a 7,500 square feet store at 150 New Bond Street and the announcement that Prada Holding would purchase the building for an estimated GBP £250 million.
Advertising.
For its advertising campaigns, Miu Miu has been working with renowned photographers including Juergen Teller (1996), Glen Luchford (1996–1998), John Akehurst (1998), Norbert Schoerner (1999), Mario Testino (2003), Inez and Vinoodh (2006–2007, 2014), Bruce Weber (2011), Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott (2012), Alasdair McLellan (2017) and Steven Meisel (2023–2024).
Spokes-models for the brand have included Laetitia Casta, Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Katie Holmes, Ginta Lapina, Lindsay Lohan, Vanessa Paradis, Chloë Sevigny, Siri Tollerod, Lindsey Wixson, Zhou Xun, Dong Jie, Jessica Stam and Joan Smalls. In May 2011, Miu Miu appointed the (then only fourteen-year-old) actress Hailee Steinfeld to be the new younger face of the brand. For the 2012 campaign, a 34-year-old, U.S. model Guinevere Van Seenus was chosen. In 2018, actress Elle Fanning became the face of the brand. In October 2021, South Korean singer and actress Im Yoon-ah was selected as a brand ambassador. The next month, South Korean singer Jang Won-young was announced as a brand ambassador. In June 2023, Japanese singer and dancer Momo Hirai was selected as the brand's Japanese ambassador.
In August 2023, (G)I-dle’s Minnie was chosen as a new House Ambassador for Miu Miu.
In 2011, Miu Miu launched the "Women's Tales" series. The campaign consisted of short films that were produced in conjunction with high-profile female directors. The outcome was a list of short, silent films that featured Miu Miu's collections. The first four short films were directed by Zoe Cassavetes, Lucrecia Martel, Giada Colagrande and Massy Tadjedin and were screened at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. A fifth film that debuted in 2013 was written and directed by Ava DuVernay, who also starred in the film.
In 2015, the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority banned a Miu Miu ad with actress Mia Goth that ran in British "Vogue", after having received a complaint that Goth (then 22) looked underage because she wore "minimal make up". MiuMiu stated that Goth wore a "sophisticated outfit, without a low neck-line, and nude make up" and "Vogue" defended the ad as sophisticated and noted they had received no complaints from readers. The decision was widely criticised with "Dazed" calling the decision "simply not good enough" and "a disservice".
Recent Developments.
Miu Miu has experienced remarkable growth, especially among the younger consumers, as a "youthful-leaning sister brand" of Prada. In 2024, the brand's revenues increased by 105% in the third quarter and 97% in the first nine months. Overall, Prada Group's revenues rose 10% during the same period. Miu Miu was recognized for a 93% sales increase in the first half of 2024. CEO Andrea Guerra mentioned the brand's focus on enhancing its identity and expanding retail presence to sustain this.

Original Masters

Original Masters is a greatest hits album by Jethro Tull released under Chrysalis Records in 1985. It was the band's third such effort, the first two being "M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull" (1969–75, released 1976) and "Repeat - The Best of Jethro Tull - Vol II" (1969–75, released 1977). Although the compilation was released in 1985, it does not include material released after 1977.
The first two compilations had material released exclusively up to 1977 and "Original Masters" covers much of that same material with a few extras.
The CD's back insert, as well as the back cover of the LP's sleeve, mislabels the song "The Witch's Promise" as "Witches Promise".

Jig borer

The jig borer is a type of machine tool invented at the end of World War I to enable the quick and precise location of hole centers. It was invented independently in Switzerland and the United States. It resembles a specialized kind of milling machine that provides tool and die makers with a higher degree of positioning precision (repeatability) and accuracy than those provided by general machines. Although capable of light milling, a jig borer is more suited to highly accurate drilling, boring, and reaming, where the quill or headstock does not see the significant side loading that it would with mill work. The result is a machine designed more for location accuracy than heavy material removal.
A typical jig borer has a work table of around which can be moved using large handwheels (with micrometer-style readouts and verniers) on particularly carefully made shafts with a strong degree of gearing; this allows positions to be set on the two axes to an accuracy of . It is generally used to enlarge to a precise size smaller holes drilled with less accurate machinery in approximately the correct place (that is, with the small hole strictly within the area to be bored out for the large hole).
Jig borers are limited to working materials that are still soft enough to be bored. Often a jig is hardened; for a jig borer this requires the material to be bored first and then hardened, which may introduce distortion. Consequently, the jig grinder was developed as a machine with the precision of the jig borer, but capable of working materials in their hardened state.
History.
Before the jig borer was developed, hole center location had been accomplished either with layout (either quickly-but-imprecisely or painstakingly-and-precisely) or with drill jigs (themselves made with painstaking-and-precise layout). The jig borer was invented to expedite the making of drill jigs, but it helped to eliminate the need for drill jigs entirely by making quick precision directly available for the parts that the jigs would have been created for. The revolutionary underlying principle was that advances in machine tool control that expedited the making of jigs were fundamentally a way to expedite the cutting process itself, for which the jig was just a means to an end. Thus, the jig borer's development helped advance machine tool technology toward later NC and CNC development. The jig borer was a logical extension of manual machine tool technology that began to incorporate some then-novel concepts that would become routine with NC and CNC control, such as:
Franklin D. Jones, in his textbook "Machine Shop Training Course" (5th ed), noted:
Several innovations in the development of the jig borer were the work of the Moore Special Tool Company, such as the adoption of hardened and accurate leadscrews, formed by grinding, rather than a soft leadscrew with a compensating nut.
The technological advances that led to the jig borer and NC were about to usher in the age of CNC and CAD/CAM, radically changing the way people manufacture many of their goods.

Tilla Durieux

Tilla Durieux (born Ottilie Godeffroy; 18 August 1880 – 21 February 1971) was an Austrian theatre and film actress of the 20th century.
Early years.
Born Ottilie Helene Angela Godeffroy
on 18 August 1880 in Vienna, she was the daughter of the Austrian chemist Richard Max Victor Godeffroy (1847–1895) and his wife, the Hungarian pianist Adelheid Ottilie Augustine Godeffroy (née Hrdlicka, died 1920), who was born in Romania. After graduating from elementary school, she switched to the public school in Alsergrund, Vienna. She was baptized in the evangelical parish Augsburg Confession in Vienna. On 31 May 1928 she converted to Catholicism
Stage career.
She adopted "Durieux" as a stage name because her mother disapproved of her acting career. She trained as an actress in Vienna and made her debut at the Moravian Theatre in Olmütz (now Olomouc) in 1902. She then moved to Berlin where she worked with Max Reinhardt and with a group of expressionist artists around Kurt Hiller and Jakob van Hoddis. In 1903, she performed as Salome (in conjunction with Gertrud Eysoldt) in Oscar Wilde's play of the same name. The role brought Durieux great recognition, drawing the attention of well-known artists, including Auguste Renoir, Max Slevogt, Lovis Corinth, and Franz von Stuck, all of whom painted her portrait.
In 1911 Durieux entered the stage of the Lessing Theater where, on 1 November 1913, she became the second actress to perform the role Eliza Doolittle in a German language production of George Bernard Shaw's play "Pygmalion", half a year before its English premiere on 11 April 1914. From 1915 she performed at the Royal Schauspielhaus Berlin. In 1923, Durieux appeared on Broadway in Dario Niccodemi's play "The Shadow" at the 39th Street Theatre.
Marriages.
In 1904, Durieux married the Berlin Secession painter Eugen Spiro, whose younger sister was Baladine Klossowska. They divorced consensually in 1905, after she had fallen in love with Paul Cassirer. She started dating the successful art dealer and editor and they got married in 1910. The marriage lasted 16 years, however Cassirer was very affected when Durieux wanted to divorce him. When their divorce was declared in 1926, Cassirer committed suicide in a room next to the court room where their hearing had taken place.
Soon after, Durieux married general director Ludwig Katzenellenbogen. In 1927 they were the main financiers of Erwin Piscator's Neues Schauspielhaus project. Durieux was a public character of 1920s Berlin and associated with numerous celebrities like the photographer Frieda Riess.
Escape from Germany.
In 1933, Durieux and Katzenellenbogen left Nazi Germany for Switzerland to escape Nazi rule. She continued to perform at the Vienna Theater in der Josefstadt and in Prague. In 1937 she moved to Zagreb, Croatia (then in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) where she became a member of the International Red Aid. Durieux unsuccessfully tried to obtain visa for the United States. In 1941 Ludwig Katzenellenbogen was arrested by Gestapo agents in Thessaloniki and deported to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. He died in 1944 at .
Return and late years.
Durieux managed to return to West Germany in 1952, appearing on stages in Berlin, Hamburg, and Münster. The plays in which she performed included "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg, ' by Max Frisch, and the ' by Gerhart Hauptmann.
In 1971 Durieux underwent surgery for a hip fracture and died of post-operative sepsis. Although the date on her gravestone is 21 January 1971, she died on 21 of February 1971, which would have been the 100th birthday of Paul Cassirer.
Art collection.
Durieux's marriage to her second husband, Paul Cassirer, brought her into the world of art collecting. In addition to family portraits, the Tilla Durieux and Paul Cassirer Collection included modern works of art. When she and her third husband, Ludwig Katzenellenbogen, emigrated from Nazi Germany in 1933, they took some artworks with them.
Durieux’s collection was integrated into the Art Collection. On November 13, 1945, the Commission for Gathering and Protecting of Cultural Monuments and Antiques proclaimed that the Zlata Lubienski Art Collection was a ‘protected’ collection under the Section for Museums of the Department of Art and Culture of the Ministry of Education of the Federal Republic of Croatia. Scholars have emphasized the ambiguous meaning of the word "protection". Lubienski and Durieux contested the decision but were denied.
On February 17, 1982, the City Institute for the Conservation of Cultural and Natural Heritage for the City Council in Zagreb gave a permit for the export of the Tilla Durieux Collection. A commission whose members included Ida Slade Šilović (City Institute for the Conservation of Cultural and Natural Heritage for the City Council in Zagreb), Zdenko Kuzmić and Zdenka Kazmar (City Museum in Zagreb), Dubravka Osrečki (Committee for Public Affairs) and Ljiljana Poljak (from City Administration) was established. The Tilla Durieux Collection was divided, leaving nineteen art works in Zagreb as a part of a new Tilla Durieux Collection at the City Museum in Zagreb while 58 items were exported to Germany, where many were sold.
The heirs of Ludwig Katzenellenbogen and his ex-wife Estella have listed fifty artworks with the .

James Neale

Captain James Neale (1615 – 1684) was an influential early immigrant to Maryland.
Early life.
Neale was born in 1615, to Jane Baker and Raphael Neale of Drury Lane, London and of Wollaston, Northamptonshire, England. One of his daughters was Henrietta Maria Neale, who married Richard Bennett Jr., son of Governor Richard Bennett of Virginia.
Career.
Neale immigrated to the Province of Maryland in about 1636 or 1637. He was 21 years old. On June 19, 1641, Neale received 1000 acres (4 km2) of land for having transported himself and five servants to Maryland. He assigned these acres to Thomas Hebden.
In a warrant dated July 25, 1641 in London from Lord Baltimore, Neale was granted another 2000 acres (8 km2) on October 31, 1642 for a manor which would be called Wollaston. The manor would prove to be the principal seat of the Neale family for several generations and was situated in what would later be called Charles County, Maryland.
Neale was a member of the Maryland Council in 1643 and again in 1644. In 1644, Neale aided Thomas Cornwallis in arresting accused pirate Richard Ingle for anti-royal behaviors. However, both Neale and Cornwallis set Captain Ingle free and were only fined and suspended. 
By 1647 he had returned to England leaving his father-in-law, Benjamin Gill, as his attorney and representative in Maryland. During his absence from Maryland he resided in Spain and Portugal, where he engaged in commerce, and was also employed in various affairs by the King and the Duke of York.
In 1660 he was an agent of Lord Baltimore at Amsterdam to protest against the settlement of Dutch upon the Delaware. On January 9, 1659/60 Lord Baltimore issued a special order, reciting that whereas Neale, formerly an inhabitant of Maryland, has been absent from the province for some years, and now desires to return with his family there to reside and inhabit, he has full leave to do so as also to possess such lands as he has a right to, and to enter and trade freely in any port in Maryland. Neale died in 1684, leaving a will dated November 27, 1683 and proved March 29, 1684.
Personal life.
He married Anne Gill, daughter of Benjamin Gill, Gentleman, and Mary Mainwaring (a descendant of Thomas Stanley, King of Mann). Anne Gill served as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I.
Their children included:
Legacy.
Many of Neale's descendants became Jesuit priests, including Bennett Neale, Archbishop Leonard Neale, Francis Neale, Charles Neale, and William Matthews. One of his descendants, William Gaston Lewis, became a Confederate General in the Civil War.

Florida State Seminoles football

The Florida State Seminoles football team represents Florida State University (variously Florida State or FSU) in the sport of American football. The Seminoles compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The team is currently coached by Mike Norvell, and plays home games at Doak Campbell Stadium, the 15th largest stadium in college football, located on-campus in Tallahassee, Florida. The Seminoles previously competed as part of the ACC Atlantic Division.
Florida State has won three national championships, nineteen conference titles (three Dixie, sixteen ACC), and six division titles and have made one playoff appearance; the Seminoles have achieved three undefeated seasons, in 1950, 1999, and 2013. Other accomplishments include finishing ranked in the top four of the AP Poll for 14 straight years from 1987 through 2000, completing 41 straight winning seasons from 1977 through 2017, winning 29 consecutive games from 2012 through 2014, tied for the ninth-longest winning streak in college football and tied for the longest winning streak in ACC history, and also winning 29 consecutive conference games from 1992 through 1995, the longest winning streak in ACC history. The 1999 team was recognized by ESPN as one of the top teams in college football history.
The team has produced three Heisman Trophy winners: quarterbacks Charlie Ward in 1993, Chris Weinke in 2000 and Jameis Winston in 2013. The program has produced 224 All-Americans (46 consensus and 15 unanimous) and over 300 professional players, including two Super Bowl MVPs and 106 Pro Bowl selections. Florida State has had nine members inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, two members inducted into the College Football Coaches Hall of Fame and five members inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Biletnikoff Award, presented annually to the top receiver in college football, is named for Florida State hall of fame player Fred Biletnikoff and the Bobby Bowden Award, presented by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, is named after Florida State hall of fame coach Bobby Bowden.
The Florida State Seminoles have the twelfth-highest winning percentage among all college football programs in Division I FBS history with over 500 victories and twenty-six ten win seasons. Florida State has appeared in over 50 postseason bowl games, ranking ninth nationally for bowl winning percentage and fourth for bowl wins with five Orange Bowl victories.
History.
Florida State's football program was first established in 1902, resuming play and adopting the 'Seminole' nickname in 1947, after forty-six years. The Seminoles joined the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1992, following a long history of competing independently.
Early history (1902–1975).
Florida State University traces the start of its athletic program to 1902, when Florida State College played the first of its three seasons. From 1902 to 1904, the institution then known as Florida State College fielded a varsity football team called "The Eleven" that played other teams. The Florida State players wore gold uniforms.
W. W. Hughes, professor of Latin and the head of men's sports at the school, served as the first coach. They played their first game against the Bainbridge Giants, a city team from Bainbridge, Georgia, defeating them 5–0. The team then played back-to-back matches against Florida Agricultural College (which later merged into what is now the University of Florida) one week apart, winning the first 6–0 and losing the second 0–6. The following season student enthusiasm grew even more, and the Eleven arranged a full schedule of six games. They competed against teams such as the University of Florida in Lake City (as Florida Agricultural College was then called), Georgia Tech, and the East Florida Seminary (another school that merged into the University of Florida), and finished the season by competing against Stetson College in Jacksonville for "The Florida Times-Union" Championship Cup. The following year Jack Forsythe, later the first head coach of the Florida Gators, replaced Hughes as coach, and the Eleven won the unofficial "state championship" by defeating Stetson in Tallahassee. Jock Hanvey assisted Forsythe.
This would be The Eleven's last season, however, as the Florida State Legislature passed the Buckman Act, which reorganized Florida's six colleges into three institutions segregated by gender and race: a school for white males, a school for white females, and a school for African Americans. Florida State College became Florida Female College until 1909, when it became Florida State College for Women. Four other institutions (including the University of Florida in Lake City and the East Florida Seminary) were merged into the new white men's-only University of the State of Florida in Gainesville. Males who formerly attended Florida State College were required to transfer to the Gainesville campus, although several former FSC players transferred to Grant University (now the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga), with five joining Grant's football team. In 1909 several veterans of the FSC Eleven founded a city team named the Tallahassee Athletics, but this folded after one season. Except for this, until 1947, Tallahassee's only organized or collegiate football team were the team from the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes (now Florida A&amp;M University).
The end of World War II brought enormous pressure on the university system in Florida, which saw an influx of veterans applying for college under the GI Bill. The Florida Legislature responded by renaming the Florida State College for Women to Florida State University and allowing men to attend the university for the first time since 1905; football then returned to the university, beginning with the 1947 season. From 1948 through 1959, the Seminole football program achieved much success under coaches Don Veller and Tom Nugent. Ed Williamson, who introduced football to the school, served as the first coach of the Florida State Seminoles. In his first and only season with Florida State, the Seminoles posted an 0–5 record. Williamson has the worst record out of all the head coaches at Florida State and is the only coach to have a winless mark. As the second coach at Florida State, Don Veller coached at Florida State for five years and compiled a record of 31–12–1. Veller was the first coach to find success coaching the Seminoles. In 1950, Veller led the Seminoles to an 8–0 record, the first unbeaten season in school history. Once Veller left the school, Tom Nugent became the third coach at Florida State. He stayed at Florida State for six years and compiled a record of 34–28–1. In one of his most notable accomplishments, Nugent gave the Seminoles their first win over an SEC opponent with a 10–0 victory against Tennessee in 1958. The fourth coach at Florida State was Perry Moss who coached the Seminoles for one year after compiling a 4–6 record. He became the second Florida State coach to leave the school with a losing record and the second to coach at the school for only one season after leaving to coach in the CFL.
With the arrival of head coach Bill Peterson in 1960, the Seminoles began their move to national prominence. Under Peterson's direction, the Seminoles beat the Florida Gators for the first time in 1964 and earned their first major bowl bid. Peterson also led the Seminoles to their first ever top ten ranking. During his tenure as head coach, Peterson also gave a young assistant by the name of Bobby Bowden his first major college coaching opportunity. Although not widely known, the Seminoles achieved their first ever number one ranking during this period. In October 1964, the Dunkel College Football Index, a popular power index of that era, placed the Seminoles at the top of their poll after a stunning 48–6 win over highly ranked Kentucky (AP No. 5, Dunkel No. 3). Peterson would be named UPI national coach of the week after this program changing victory. In an era of very few bowl games, Peterson's innovative offensive system helped earn the Seminoles four bowl bids from 1964 through 1968. During this time, only Alabama and Mississippi appeared in more bowl games than did Peterson's Seminoles. Receiving a football scholarship, famed actor Robert Urich was a back up center on the Seminoles from 1964 to 1967. In 1968, Peterson's eighth year at the helm, the Seminoles claimed their third straight bowl bid as Florida State became the first major college in the state of Florida to earn such a distinction. The Seminoles would not repeat this feat again until the ninth season of the Bobby Bowden era. 
In the summer of 1967, Peterson also engineered another first for the Seminole program when he decided to begin the recruitment of African American football players. Apparently, he did so without approval from either the school president or its athletic director. On December 16, 1967, the Seminoles signed Ernest Cook, a fullback from Daytona Beach. Several months later, the Seminoles would sign running back Calvin Patterson from Dade County. Ultimately, Cook decided to switch his allegiance to Minnesota where he would become an All-Big Ten running back. In the fall of 1968, Patterson would become the first African American student to play for the Seminoles as a starter for the Florida State freshmen football team. In the fall of 1970, J. T. Thomas would become the first African American to play in a varsity game for the Seminoles.
Following Peterson's successful run, the next two coaches had disappointing tenures. Larry Jones was appointed as the sixth head coach at Florida State. Jones coached for three years from 1971 to 1973 and compiled a record of 15–19, becoming the third Florida State coach to have a losing record. Darrell Mudra was then hired to be the seventh coach of the Seminoles. Mudra lasted just two years from 1974 to 1975 and compiled a record of 4–18. He became the fourth head coach to have a losing record at Florida State.
Bobby Bowden era (1976–2009).
Under head coach Bobby Bowden, who came to Florida State from West Virginia, the Seminoles became one of the nation's most competitive programs, greatly expanding the tradition of football at Florida State. The Seminoles played in five national championship games between 1993 and 2000, and claimed the championship twice, in 1993 and 1999. The FSU football team was the most successful team in college football during the 1990s, boasting an 89% winning percentage. FSU also set an NCAA record for most consecutive Top 5 finishes in the AP football poll – receiving placement 14 years in a row, from 1987 to 2000. The Seminoles under Bowden were the first college football team in history to be ranked first place wire-to-wire (i.e., from preseason to postseason) since the AP began releasing preseason rankings in 1936.
In the Bowden era, prior to a 1989 game against long-standing rival Miami, University of Miami mascot Sebastian the Ibis was tackled by a group of police officers at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee as the mascot attempted to put out Chief Osceola's flaming spear. Sebastian was wearing a fireman's helmet and yellow raincoat and holding a fire extinguisher. When a police officer attempted to grab the fire extinguisher, the officer was sprayed in the chest. Sebastian was handcuffed by four officers but ultimately released. University of Miami quarterback Gino Torretta told ESPN, "Even if we weren't bad boys, it added to the mystique that, 'Man, look, even their mascot's getting arrested.'" In the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, the Seminoles had 14 consecutive seasons with 10 or more wins and a top four finish, with a record of 152–19–1 between these years (11 of their 19 losses were decided by seven points or less), and one of the best home records of the era. FSU's accomplishments in these 14 seasons included eleven bowl wins, nine ACC championships, two Heisman Trophy winners, and two national championships.
On December 1, 2009, Bowden announced that he would retire from coaching after the Seminoles' game on New Year's Day 2010 against West Virginia, Bowden's former team, in the Gator Bowl. His legacy has led to the creation of two awards in his honor, the Bobby Bowden Award, an award presented to college football players, and the Bobby Bowden National Collegiate Coach of the Year Award, an award presented to college football coaches. In the spring of 2007, several FSU athletes including football players were accused of cheating in an online music history class. As a result of the Florida State University academic-athletic scandal, the NCAA announced that it would reduce scholarship limits in 10 sports and force Florida State to vacate all of the victories in 2006 and 2007 in which the implicated athletes participated and placed the university on probation for four years. FSU vacated 12 football victories from the 2006 and 2007 seasons and Bowden finished his career with 377 career wins.
Post-Bowden years (2010–2020).
On January 5, 2010, Jimbo Fisher officially became the ninth head football coach in Florida State history. Fisher had been a member of the Florida State staff for three years, serving as offensive coordinator. He was named head coach-in waiting during the 2008 season. In his first season as head coach, Florida State went 10–4 with a 6–2 record in ACC conference play. The Seminoles went to their first ACC Championship Game since 2005, losing to Virginia Tech 44–33, and had their first ten win season since 2003. Fisher's first Florida State team notably beat both of its in-state rivals, the Miami Hurricanes and the Florida Gators, for the first time since 1999. Florida State would go on to the Chick-fil-A Bowl, where they would beat Steve Spurrier's South Carolina team. In his second season, Florida State went 9–4 with a 5–3 record in ACC conference play. For the second year in a row, the Seminoles defeated both of their in-state rivals. Fisher's second Florida State team also defeated Notre Dame in the Champs Sports Bowl. In his third season, he led the Seminoles to their first conference title in seven years and defeated Northern Illinois to win the Orange Bowl. In the 2013 season, Jimbo Fisher guided his team to a perfect 14–0 record and a national championship with a comeback win against Auburn. In 2014, he guided Florida State to another undefeated regular season, only to be defeated by Oregon 59–20 in the Rose Bowl, the most points the Seminoles had ever surrendered in a bowl game. Florida State had victories over both in-state rivals, Florida and Miami, in six of Jimbo Fisher's first seven seasons as head coach and won ten or more games in six of his eight seasons. While the Seminoles would win at least 10 games in the next two seasons and even finished eighth in the final 2016 poll, they lost five games in ACC play–one fewer than they had lost in Fisher's first five seasons. One of those losses was a 63–20 rout at the hands of Louisville, the most points Florida State had ever surrendered at the time. In 2017, the Seminoles were ranked third in preseason polls, but a 24–7 drubbing by Alabama and a close loss to NC State knocked them out of the polls altogether for the first time since the middle of the 2011 season, and ultimately finished with their first losing on-field record in ACC play since joining the league.
Fisher resigned as FSU head coach on December 1, 2017, to accept a record ten-year, $75 million contract to become head coach at Texas A&amp;M. Defensive line coach and former defensive lineman Odell Haggins was named interim head coach, becoming Florida State's first African-American head coach, and coached in his first game the next day against Louisiana-Monroe. The Seminoles won, extending their bowl streak to an NCAA record 36 seasons. He went on to coach the Seminoles in the bowl game, leading them to a win and their 41st consecutive winning season.
On December 5, 2017, Willie Taggart left Oregon to become the new head coach at Florida State. In his first season, the Seminoles finished with a losing record for the first time since 1976 and missed a bowl game for the first time in 36 years. On November 3, 2019, Taggart was fired following a loss to Miami and a 4–5 record throughout the first nine games of the season. Haggins was once again named interim head coach to finish out the season.
Mike Norvell era (2020–present).
On December 8, 2019, Memphis head coach Mike Norvell was named the new head coach at Florida State. On September 11, 2021, the Seminoles lost to Jacksonville State; it was the first time Florida State had lost to a non-FBS opponent since 1959. In 2022, Mike Norvell led the Seminoles to a 9–3 regular season record and a berth in the 2022 Cheez-It Bowl to play against Oklahoma. Florida State moved up in the AP Poll during the season for the first time since 2016, peaking at #13 prior to the bowl game and winning the most regular season games for the first time since that season as well. The Seminoles would go on to defeat the Sooners to finish with ten wins for the first time in six years. In his fourth season, Norvell guided the Seminoles to an undefeated regular season and a conference championship.
The 2023 team was excluded from the College Football Playoff despite finishing the regular season as undefeated ACC champions. This made the Seminoles the first Power 5 champions of the playoff era to go undefeated but not be selected for the playoff bracket. Coach Mike Norvell said he was "disgusted" by the committee's decision. University Vice President and Athletic Director Michael Alford called the decision "unforgivable".
The 2024 season began with the team playing its first international game in program history. The Seminoles finished with their worst record since 1974 and their worst conference record in program history.
Conference affiliations.
In the first year of the program, Florida State competed as an independent program without conference affiliation. They were members of the Dixie Conference for three years before returning to independence. They would remain this way until 1992 when, after being courted by several conferences including the Southeastern Conference, they opted to join the Atlantic Coast Conference which is the same conference that they compete in today.
Championships.
National championships.
Florida State has been selected national champions in nine seasons by NCAA-designated major selectors. Florida State claims the 1993, 1999 and 2013 national championships after winning a postseason bowl national championship game and being named the national champion by all four major consensus selectors (AP, Coaches, FWAA, and NFF).
1993 season.
The Seminoles entered 1993 with a number one ranking and were led by quarterback and eventual Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward.
Florida State cruised to a 9–0 record with their closest game being an 18-point win over Miami. The only loss of the season came at second-ranked and undefeated Notre Dame by a score of 31–24, in one of the greatest games in college football history. Despite the loss, Florida State still went on to play for the national title, beating Nebraska in the Orange Bowl with a field goal in the final seconds to claim the school's first national title.
1999 season.
After falling short in the national title game against Tennessee in 1998, the Seminoles began the 1999 season ranked first in the country.
Florida State would go on to complete just the second undefeated season in school history and became the first team in history to be ranked number one for an entire season. The Noles would clinch their second national title with a victory over Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl.
2013 season.
After the 2012 season, FSU lost six coaches including defensive coordinator Mark Stoops. Despite the numerous coaching changes and off the field incidents, Florida State would go on to become the highest scoring team in FBS history by scoring 723 points in a single season en route to their third national championship. The record has since been broken by the 2019 LSU Tigers, with a new lead of 726 points. 
The 2013 Seminoles would hand then third ranked Clemson their worst home loss, set a new attendance record at Doak Campbell Stadium of 84,409 against the seventh ranked Miami Hurricanes, and set a school scoring record of 80 points in a game against the University of Idaho behind freshman quarterback and eventual Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston.

Bowl games.
"This is a partial list of the ten most recent bowl games Florida State has competed in."
Florida State has played in 50 bowl games in its history and has a 29–18–3 record, with one win vacated, in those games. 
The Seminoles are the ninth most successful bowl team in history and played in a record 36 consecutive bowl games from 1982 to 2017, although the NCAA doesn't recognize this because their 2006 Emerald Bowl win and appearance were both vacated as a result of the 2007 academic scandal.
Head coaches.
Florida State has had 14 head coaches since organized football began in 1902. Bobby Bowden, who spent 34 years at Florida State, is the winningest coach in school history and has been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. During his tenure, Bobby Bowden won two national championships with the Seminoles, while Jimbo Fisher won one. Fisher and Bowden also have the second and third best ACC winning percentages in conference history.

‡ Bobby Bowden's record omits 12 vacated victories including 1 bowl victory, that would otherwise make his record 316–97–4.
Doak S. Campbell Stadium.
The Florida State Seminoles originally played their home games at Centennial Field until 1950. The Seminoles had an 8–4 record at Centennial, including two undefeated home records. The team play their home games at Doak Cambell Stadium, which has a capacity of 67,277, as of 2025. Florida State is 322–110–4 in 436 games played at Doak Campbell.
The stadium, named after former school president Doak Sheridan Campbell, hosted its first game against the Randolph-Macon College Yellowjackets on October 7, 1950, with the Seminoles winning the game 40–7. At that time the facility had a seating capacity of 15,000. Doak Campbell Stadium, with its original capacity of 15,000 in 1950, was built at a cost of $250,000. In 1954, the stadium grew to a capacity of 19,000. Six thousand more seats were added in 1961. During the Bill Peterson era (1960–70), the stadium was expanded to 40,500 seats, and it remained at that capacity for the next 14 years. Since that time, the stadium has expanded to almost 83,000, largely due to the success of the football team under head coach Bobby Bowden coupled with the ever-growing student body. It now is the second largest football stadium in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).
Aesthetically, a brick facade surrounding the stadium matches the architectural design of most of the buildings on the university's campus. In addition to the obvious recreational uses, The University Center surrounds the stadium and houses many of the university's offices as well as The College of Motion Picture Arts, The Dedman School of Hospitality, and The College of Social Work. The field was officially named Bobby Bowden field on November 20, 2004, as Florida State hosted intrastate rival Florida. Florida State has been recognized as having one of the best gameday atmospheres in the country, and Doak Campbell Stadium has been named one of the top stadiums in college sports.
Doak Campbell Stadium has been a great home field advantage for the Noles. Florida State is one of only three schools that can boast a decade home field unbeaten streak. The Seminoles never lost a home game from 1992 to 2001, a total of 54 games, and have completed 24 undefeated seasons at their home stadiums, including 22 at Doak Campbell.
The record crowd for the stadium is 84,431; set during a game against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish on October 18, 2014.
Rivalries.
The Seminoles' archrivals are Florida, whom they meet annually in the last game of the regular season, and Miami; both games are considered among the greatest rivalries in college football. A rivalry with Clemson has developed and grown due to both teams competing yearly for the Atlantic division.
Florida.
The Florida Gators are the main rival of the Florida State Seminoles. Florida State and Florida have played each other 68 times, with the Gators holding a 38–28–2 advantage. After the arrival of Bobby Bowden in 1976, the Seminoles have compiled a record of 26–23–1. The game alternates between Florida's home stadium, Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Gainesville, Florida and Florida State's home stadium, Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, Florida.
Miami.
The rivalry dates to 1951, when the Miami Hurricanes defeated the Seminoles 35–13 in their inaugural meeting. The schools have played uninterrupted since 1966, with Miami leading the series 36–33, as of the 2024 season.
During the 1980s and 90s, the series emerged as one of the premier rivalries in college football. Between 1983 and 2013, the Hurricanes and Seminoles combined to win 8 national championships (5 for Miami, 3 for Florida State) and played in 15 national championship games (1983, 85, 86, 87, 89, 91, 92, 93, 96, 98, 99, 2000, 01, 02, 13). The rivalry has been popular not only because of its profound national championship implications and the competitiveness of the games but also because of the immense NFL-caliber talent typically present on the field when the two teams meet. The famous 1987 matchup featured over 50 future NFL players on both rosters combined.
The rivalry is a television ratings bonanza, accounting for the two highest rated college football telecasts in ESPN history. The 2006 game between Miami and FSU was the second most-viewed college football game, regular season or bowl, in the history of ESPN, averaging 6.33 million households in viewership (a 6.9 rating). It trailed only the 1994 game between Miami and FSU, which notched a 7.7 rating.
The Florida Cup is the trophy sponsored by the state of Florida given to either the Florida State University Seminoles, the University of Florida Gators, or the University of Miami Hurricanes for winning a round-robin against the other two teams in the same season (including bowl games if necessary).
It was created in 2002 by the Florida Sports Foundation, the official sports promotion and development organization of the state of Florida, and the Florida Championships Awards, Inc. The idea of finally having a trophy for the round robin winner between the three schools was enthusiastically endorsed by then governor Jeb Bush. Along with the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy (given to the winner of the round robin between Army, Navy and Air Force), the Florida Cup is one of the very few three way rivalries that presents a trophy to the winner.
The Florida Cup was awarded to the Florida State Seminoles in 2013, as Florida and Miami played in the regular season. The Makala Trophy is awarded to the winner of the Florida–Florida State game at the winning team's spring scrimmage.
Clemson.
Florida State has a rivalry with conference foe, the Clemson Tigers. Florida State leads the all-time series 21–16. The Seminoles dominated the contests through most of the 1990s but 1999 marked a milestone as the hire of Bobby Bowden's son Tommy led to the first meeting, in 1999, which was the first time in Division I-A history that a father and a son met as opposing head coaches in a football game. During the time Tommy coached at Clemson, the game was known as the "Bowden Bowl"; Bobby won the series in the 9 years it was played before Tommy's resignation, taking 5 of those games with all four losses within the last five seasons.
One sticking point in the rivalry remains that a proud Clemson Tiger program that was strong in the 1980s had won 6 of the past 11 ACC titles from 1981 to 1991. 1991 would be the last ACC Championship the Tigers would win until 2011 as Florida State entered the ACC in 1992 and proceeded to win the next 9 ACC Championships in a row, and 12 of the next 14 in the series.
Virginia.
The Seminoles also have a rivalry with the Virginia Cavaliers. Florida State and Virginia compete for the Jefferson–Eppes Trophy. The two schools have played for the trophy since its creation in 1995. It has been awarded a total of 19 times, with FSU receiving it 14 times (FSU vacated its 2006 win). The Seminoles hold the all-time advantage 14–4. Because of conference expansion, the teams no longer play annually; the teams last met in 2019.
The Jefferson–Eppes Trophy is awarded to the winner of the Florida State–Virginia game. This game was played annually from 1992 through 2005, but since the conference split into divisions, the teams meet twice every six years. Florida State has been awarded the trophy 15 times.

In 1989, it began recognizing the Top 25 teams.‡ UPI/Coaches Poll began selecting its Top 20 teams on a weekly basis in 1950 before expanding to the nations's Top 25 teams in 1990.
Traditions.
There are numerous Florida State traditions associated with athletics, particularly football. These include the mascots, Osceola and Renegade, the planting of the spear at midfield before football games, the FSU Fight Song, the FSU Hymns, the War Chant, the Tomahawk Chop, and the Legacy Walk. The team's uniforms pay respect to the Seminole culture using tribal influences with Native American symbols representing an arrow, a man on a horse, and fire. The Seminole tribe is also recognized with the playing of Seminole Wind at the start of the second quarter during home games. Fans of the Florida State Seminoles are known as The Tribe, a nod to the nickname that the team carries.
Osceola and Renegade.
Osceola and Renegade are the official symbols of the Florida State Seminoles. During home football games, Osceola, portraying the Seminole leader Osceola, charges down the field at Doak Campbell Stadium riding an appaloosa horse named Renegade, and hurls a burning spear at midfield to begin every game. The Seminole Tribe of Florida officially sanctions the use of the Seminole as Florida State University's nickname and of Osceola as FSU's symbol.
Marching Chiefs.
The Marching Chiefs is the official marching band of the Florida State Seminoles. The band plays at every home game as well as at some away games (Clemson, Miami, and Florida) as well as any Championship or Bowl game.
War Chant.
The Seminole War Chant was first used in a 1984 game against Auburn. The chant was started in FSU's Marching Band – The Marching Chiefs, originally by members of the percussion section. The melody is based on the 1960s cheer, massacre. The chant has also become associated with the tomahawk chop.
The War Chant would be adopted by the Atlanta Braves when FSU football alumnus Deion Sanders joined the team, and has been used ever since. Craig Day began the Chop at now-defunct Fulton County stadium in response to UF Gator fans doing the Gator Chomp every time Deion came up to the plate. It is also used by the NFL team the Kansas City Chiefs, Mexican soccer club Santos Laguna and the Turkish soccer club Galatasaray.
Sod Cemetery.
Florida State's Sod Cemetery is a rich part of the program's history. When FSU wins a difficult away game, a piece of turf is pulled from the field and buried in the cemetery. Florida State sod games represent the most difficult battles on the football field. The Sod Cemetery stands as a tribute to those triumphs. There are 111 pieces of sod in the cemetery.
In 1962, as the Seminoles completed their Thursday practice in preparation to face Georgia at Sanford Stadium, Dean Coyle Moore – a long-time professor and member of FSU's athletic board – issued a challenge: "Bring back some sod from between the hedges at Georgia." On Saturday, October 20, the Seminoles scored an 18–0 victory over the favored Bulldogs. Team captain Gene McDowell pulled a small piece of grass from the field, which was presented to Moore at the next football practice. Moore and FSU coach Bill Peterson had the sod buried on the practice field as a symbol of victory. A monument was placed to commemorate the triumph and the tradition of the sod game was born.
Before leaving for all road games in which Florida State is the underdog, all road games at the University of Florida and all ACC championship and bowl games, Seminole captains gather their teammates to explain the significance of the tradition. Victorious captains return with a piece of the opponent's turf to be buried in the Sod Cemetery inside the gates of the practice field. In recent years, as the Florida State program has been successful, games of significance regardless of whether or not the Seminoles are the underdog, can be designated a "sod game."
Famous former players.
Seminoles in the NFL.
Florida State has sent 306 players to the National Football League since 1951, including 47 first-round draft picks. Florida State has had a player drafted in each draft since 1984. Jameis Winston holds the record as the highest Seminole taken in the NFL draft as he was selected with the first overall pick by Tampa Bay in the 2015 draft. Eleven players, a school record, were taken in the 2013 NFL draft, a record tied in 2015.
Seventy-five former players have gone on to play in the Super Bowl with two, Fred Biletnikoff and Dexter Jackson, being named the Super Bowl MVP. Three former Seminoles (Derrick Brooks, Warrick Dunn and Anquan Boldin) have won the Walter Payton Award.

Charles R. Floyd

Charles Richard Floyd (1881–1945), a Democrat, was elected to three four-year terms to the Texas Senate, serving a total of twelve years as a senator, from 1917 to 1929. In 1944, he re-entered the political landscape, elected to the office of State Representative of the 38th District, representing Lamar and Fannin counties.
Charles Richard Floyd was born April 25, 1881, in Boxelder, Red River County, Texas. The third son of Lorenzo Dow and Isabelle “Belle” Peek Floyd, his father died at the plow when Charles was only three years old. He attended Boxelder schools, Detroit Normal School, and also studied in nearby Paris, Texas. He earned a teaching certificate and taught in the English community in Red River County for four years, which greatly influenced his later efforts in the legislature on behalf of the public school system. He also attended the University of Texas at Austin.
In addition to being a state senator from 1917 to 1929 and state representative in 1945 until his death, he ran numerous businesses during his lifetime. He was owner of the Annona Cash Store; Editor of the "Clarksville Times"; Owner and Editor of the "Annona News Weekly"; and District Manager for the "Dallas Morning News" for Northeast Texas. He was also a member of the Annona School Board.
Floyd married Mary Etta Moore, also of Red River County, and had four children: Morris (who died at age four); William Lorenzo; Louise Floyd Meyers; and Leone Floyd Popp; and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren. After being elected to the Senate, Floyd moved the family to Paris, Texas. Upon his death during the legislative session of 1945, his daughter Louise ran for his seat in a special election, but was narrowly defeated at a time when there were only four women serving in the House and none in the Senate.
On February 17, 1945, after serving only six weeks in the House of Representatives, Charles Floyd suffered a stroke and heart attack during a legislative session in Austin and died in Brackenridge Hospital. He is buried in Boxelder Cemetery, Red River County, Texas.
Floyd was inducted into the Red River County Hall of Fame by the Historic Red River County Chamber of Commerce in 2006.
Education.
Floyd's legislative career was marked by his strong commitment to public education and moral issues and tempered by his sense of patriotism, fairness, and the importance of good organization and administration of state government. He spoke to the needs of children in Texas from the outset of his tenure with the passage of several bills promoting aid for rural schools and creating numerous independent school districts in Northeast Texas. He contributed to establishing the availability of financial aid and appropriating funds for the rural schools and was instrumental in helping raise the standard of public education in Texas. He favored rural school enactments, believing that the child in the "little red schoolhouse" should have all the advantages then afforded to the more fortunate child of the city.
Paris Junior College.
Senate Bill 30, one of Floyd's most important pieces of legislation in the Senate, proved to be an innovative concept in junior college funding and administration; it was authored during Floyd's last Senate session and carefully shepherded to final passage. The bill was a critical step in the development of a state policy for junior college education in Texas. He was an original founder of Paris Junior College in Paris, Texas, and actively fought for funding and continued support of the institution throughout his tenure in the legislature. With his work in support of the junior college system, his foresight and belief in the importance that an education be equitable and available to all students, and his dedication to the future of education, it was said by many that he could fairly be called the Father of Public Junior College Education in Texas.
McDonald Observatory.
Floyd authored and successfully passed into law Senate Bill 254 in February, 1927. This legislation relieved the University of Texas from the payment of and liability for inheritance taxes with respect to the W. J. McDonald Observatory Fund, bequeathed by the will of McDonald, another resident of Paris, Texas (Handbook of Texas). This financial step aided in the early years to provide more extensive funding for the institution, and it was the first legislation relating to the McDonald Observatory. This important legislation provided for the development of the University of Texas McDonald Observatory into a world-class facility.
Other legislation.
Floyd traveled to Austin from his district during the legislative sessions, a trip which his children remembered as being long and adventurous, taking four days. Many of the roads were dirt and gravel during those years. He believed that the future of Texas lay in the development of the highway system, and his efforts were unbending in that direction. He supported the construction and maintenance by the state of county farm-to-market roads. In 1926, he authored and passed eight bills creating special road districts in Texas, and was thus a pioneer in the creation of the excellent state road system.
An avid supporter of women's rights, Floyd was joint author of the law permitting women to vote in primary elections and conventions in the state of Texas. A special note should be taken of his resolutions which applauded a U.S. Senator for his advocacy of women's suffrage.
He was also joint author of the Floyd-Strickland Bill which provided improved housing rights for tenants and the Dean Prohibition Enforcement Law; he also questioned Governor James "Pa" Ferguson during the impeachment trial of 1917; and one of the first pieces of legislation he authored when he entered the Senate was a bill to erect a monument on the Capitol grounds to the Texans who fought and died in World War I, a monument which was not completed until 1961.
He also authored and jointly authored many other bills, and a full legislative history can be found at the Legislative Reference Library of Texas.
President Pro Tem.
One of the high points of Floyd's career was his election as President Pro Tem of the Senate on the last day of the 37th Legislative Session. It was a high honor and soundly supported by his fellow senators.

Duke Blue Devils football

The Duke Blue Devils football team represents Duke University in the sport of American football. The Blue Devils compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The program has 17 conference championships (7 ACC championships and 10 Southern Conference titles), 53 All-Americans, 10 ACC Players of the Year, and have had three Pro Football Hall of Famers come through the program. The team is coached by Manny Diaz and play their home games at Wallace Wade Stadium in Durham, North Carolina.
After struggling for most of the time since the mid-1960s, the Blue Devils underwent a renaissance under David Cutcliffe (2008–2021). Duke secured their first Coastal division title on November 30, 2013, with a win over arch-rival North Carolina. Additionally, the Blue Devils cracked the top 25 of the BCS standings, the AP Poll, and the Coaches' Poll during the 2013 season and very nearly scored an upset over a potent Texas A&amp;M team in the 2013 Chick-fil-A Bowl, losing by only four points after jumping out to a 38–17 lead at halftime. In 2014, Duke followed up with a nine win season, including a victory over eventual Orange Bowl winner Georgia Tech, and another close bowl loss to 15th-ranked Arizona State in the Sun Bowl. In 2015, the Blue Devils broke through for a 44–41 overtime win over Indiana in the Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium, and followed up with a win over Northern Illinois in the 2017 Quick Lane Bowl.
History.
Early history (1888–1930).
The Duke Blue Devils, then known as the Trinity Blue and White, first fielded a football team in 1888, coached by John Franklin Crowell. The first game against North Carolina was the first "scientific" game in the state. Trinity finished the first two seasons in their football history with records of 2–1 in 1888 and 1–1 in 1889. From 1890 to 1895, Trinity competed without a head coach. The 1891 team went undefeated. Trinity did not compete in football from 1895 to 1919. The Trinity Blue and White resumed football competition in 1920 under head coach Floyd J. Egan, compiling a record of 4–0–1 that season. In 1921, they finished 6–1–2 were led by James A. Baldwin, previously the head coach at Maine.
In February 1922, Herman Steiner was selected as the head coach of the Trinity College football team for the 1922 season. During the 1922 football season, Steiner coached the Trinity football team to a 7–2–1 record as the team outscored its opponents 156–57. E. L. Alexander took over the reins of the Trinity Blue Devils in 1923 and led the team to a 5–4 record. In their first season competing as Duke University, Howard Jones took over in 1924 and led the Blue Devils to a 4–5 record before leaving for USC. Former Indiana head coach James Herron led the Blue Devils to another 4–5 record in 1925. From 1926 to 1930, the program was led by head coach James DeHart who compiled a 24–23–2 record during his tenure. DeHart led the Blue Devils, an independent for all of its history up to that point, into the Southern Conference in 1928.
Wallace Wade era (1931–1950).
In late 1930, Wallace Wade shocked the college football world by leaving national powerhouse Alabama for Duke. Wade's success at Alabama translated well to Duke's program. He sent former Alabama players and future Duke assistants Herschel Caldwell and Ellis Hagler to the school a year early to prepare a team.
Duke won seven Southern Conference championships in the 16 years that Wade was coach. He also led the team to two Rose Bowls. Wade served a stint in the military in World War II, leaving the team after the 1941 season and returning before the start of the 1946 season. Wade's achievements placed him in the College Football Hall of Fame.
Duke was invited to the 1942 Rose Bowl against Oregon State. Due to fears of additional west coast attacks by the Japanese in the wake of Pearl Harbor, the game was moved to Durham. As Duke's stadium was significantly smaller than the regular venue, bleachers were borrowed from both North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina. Despite being 3 to 1 favorites, the Iron Dukes lost 20–16.
Wade retired after the 1950 season. For his great achievements, Duke named their football stadium after him. The Blue Devils still play their home games at Wallace Wade Stadium. Wade's final record at Duke is 110–36–7.
William Murray era (1951–1965).
Delaware head coach Bill Murray was chosen to replace Wallace Wade as Duke's head coach in 1951. The football program proved successful under Murray's tutelage, winning six of the first ten ACC football championships from 1953 to 1962. From 1943 until 1957, the Blue Devils were ranked in the AP Poll at some point in the season. Murray's Duke teams would be last successes the Blue Devils football program would have for another two decades. Bill Murray would be the last Duke head football coach to leave the Blue Devils with a winning record until Steve Spurrier, and the last to leave Duke after having won multiple conference championships. After Murray's retirement following the 1965 season, Duke's football program would steadily decline into becoming the ACC's "cellar-dweller". Murray led Duke to its last bowl appearance and conference championships, shared or outright, until 1989. Murray's final record at Duke was 91–51–9 in 15 seasons.
Struggles (1966–1986).
After Murray came Tom Harp, who had a 22–28–1 record in 5 seasons with the Blue Devils. A very successful high school coach, Harp came to Duke after a mediocre stint as Cornell's head football coach. Harp's teams struggled on the field, only producing one winning season, a 6–5 1970 season that would be Harp's last at Duke, as he was fired following the season.
Mike McGee returned to his alma mater from East Carolina to serve as head football coach in late 1970. Duke continued in the mediocrity and sub-par on-the-field performances that had been seen under Harp, going 37–47–4 overall. McGee's two best years were 1971 and 1974, in which his Duke teams went a mediocre 6–5. McGee was dismissed after the 1978 season.
Elon head coach Shirley "Red" Wilson replaced McGee and went 16–27–1 as Duke's head football coach. Wilson's teams only won two games in his first two seasons, then had back-to-back 6–5 records. Wilson's teams became known for their innovative passing attack under offensive coordinator Steve Spurrier, whose 1982 offense featuring quarterback Ben Bennett set a school record for yardage before Wilson retired and Spurrier left to become the head coach of the USFL's Tampa Bay Bandits.
There was hope when Steve Sloan was hired that the Duke football program would finally return to its glory days under Wallace Wade. However, Sloan could not translate his successes from those places to Duke. Sloan's Blue Devils teams had a 13–31 overall record in the four seasons he was there, failing to win more than four games in a single season. Sloan resigned after four seasons as Duke head coach to become athletics director at the University of Alabama.
Steve Spurrier era (1987–1989).
The Duke Blue Devils football program had a string of successful years under Steve Spurrier. Duke was Spurrier's first college head coaching position. When Spurrier arrived as Duke's 17th head football coach in program history, he inherited a Duke program that was commonly viewed as the worst football program in the ACC. Unlike most of his predecessors since Wallace Wade, Spurrier was able to have success as Duke's head football coach. He hired coaches Ian Goodall, Joe Jeb, and Patrick Cooke to serve as assistant coaches. Spurrier led the Blue Devils to a share of the ACC title in 1989, its first ACC football title of any kind, shared or outright, since the Bill Murray era. Spurrier won ACC Coach of the Year honors in 1988 and 1989 for his achievements. He led Duke to the 1989 All-American Bowl, a game they lost 49–21 to Texas Tech. That bowl appearance was the program's first bowl appearance since the 1960 Cotton Bowl.
After three seasons and a 20–13–1 overall record, and leading the Blue Devils to seemingly unheard of football success, Spurrier left Duke after the 1989 season to accept the head football coaching position at his alma mater Florida.
Regression (1990–2007).
Barry Wilson was promoted from assistant coach and took over the Blue Devils football program after the departure of Steve Spurrier, but struggled with a 13–30–1 record in four seasons despite inheriting a team that had shared an ACC championship the season before he became the head coach. Unable to duplicate or build upon the successes of his predecessor, Wilson resigned as head coach after the 1993 season.
On December 16, 1993, Rice head coach Fred Goldsmith was named Wilson's replacement, becoming the Blue Devils' 19th head football coach.
The 1994 Blue Devils raced out to an 8–1 record, and was briefly ranked as high as No. 16 in the country before two consecutive heartbreaking losses to close the season, 24–23 to North Carolina State and 41–40 to arch-rival North Carolina. The 1994 team played in the program's first New Years Day Bowl game since 1961, falling to Wisconsin 34–21 in the 1995 Hall of Fame Bowl, later known as the Outback Bowl.
After 1994, however, Duke's football program continued to decline, with the team only winning a total of nine more games under Goldsmith's watch. Goldsmith's teams struggled after that 1994 season, failing to win more than four games in a single season and only notching three more wins in ACC play. In 1995, the Blue Devils finished 3–8. Goldsmith's 1996 Duke team went 0–11, the school's first winless record in the modern era and only the second winless season in school history. In 1997, the Blue Devils went 2–9. The Blue Devils compiled a 4–7 record in 1998.
On December 1, 1998, Carl Franks, offensive coordinator at Florida under former Blue Devils head coach Steve Spurrier, was hired to replace Fred Goldsmith and tasked with turning around the Duke football program. A Duke alum, Franks had also served as running backs coach at Duke under Spurrier from 1987 to 1989 and had played running back and tight end for the Blue Devils under Shirley Wilson from 1980 to 1982.
Franks led the Blue Devils to a 3–8 record in 1999. From 2000 to 2001 Duke suffered a 22-game losing streak, with both the 2000 and 2001 seasons being winless 0–11 campaigns, with only four of the 22 losses coming by eight points or fewer. Franks was dismissed mid-season in 2003. Defensive coordinator Ted Roof was appointed interim head coach.
The Blue Devils' 1999–2001 teams were ranked 7th in a list on the 10 worst college football teams of all time by ESPN's Page 2. Franks finished 7–45 in four full seasons and a partial fifth,
Despite the poor record, Franks was lauded for the academic success of his players, evidenced by his program winning the Academic Achievement Award from the American Football Coaches Association in 2003.
Ted Roof was elevated from defensive coordinator and named interim Duke head coach for the final five games of the 2003 season. The Blue Devils won two of their last three games of the season, Roof's interim tag was removed, and he was named the program's 21st head football coach in 2004.
Roof compiled a dismal 6–45 record before his firing after four seasons and a partial fifth. One positive aspect, however, from Roof's tenure was that Duke defenses consistently ranked in the top 30 in tackles for loss for the first time in years. Roof would go on to win a national championship as Auburn's defensive coordinator in 2010 under head coach Gene Chizik.
David Cutcliffe era (2008–2021).
In December 2007, Tennessee offensive coordinator and former Ole Miss head coach David Cutcliffe was hired as Duke's 22nd head football coach.
Duke went 4–8 in 2008 and 5–7 in 2009, the closest the school had come to bowl eligibility since 1994. Cutcliffe fielded back-to-back 3–9 seasons in 2010 and 2011. Duke's 2012 team became bowl eligible for the first time since 1994, finishing the season with a 6–7 record.
Duke's 2013 season was a break-out year, as the Blue Devils have continued to cross off many of their infamous losing streaks. On October 26, 2013, Duke achieved its first win over a ranked team since 1994 with a 13–10 victory over No. 14 Virginia Tech. That win over Virginia Tech was also Duke's first road win over a ranked team since 1971. The Blue Devils achieved their first winning season since 1994 with a 38–20 home victory over in-state rival NC State, and Duke appeared in the AP Poll for the first time since 1994, listed at No. 25 with a record of 8–2. With a 27–25 win over North Carolina on November 30, 2013, Duke locked up their first 10-win season in school history, the Coastal Division title, and a spot in the 2013 ACC Championship Game against Florida State, during which time Duke was ranked No. 20. The Blue Devils lost that game to the Seminoles, the eventual national champions, by a score of 45–7. David Cutcliffe received the Walter Camp Coach of the Year award in 2013.
Duke finished 9–4 in 2014. 2015 would see the Blue Devils finish 8–5. 2015 also marked the beginning of a $100 million renovation project to Wallace Wade Stadium. Cutcliffe's Blue Devils struggled to a 4–8 record in 2016. Duke finished 7–6 in 2017.
Mike Elko era (2022–2023).
On December 10, 2021, former Texas A&amp;M Aggies defensive coordinator Mike Elko was hired as the Blue Devils 23rd head football coach.
Under Elko, the Blue Devils amassed 16 wins in two years, including a stunning upset over ninth-ranked Clemson to begin the 2023 season. Clemson was the highest-ranked opponent the Blue Devils had defeated in over three decades. Elko also led Duke to a win in the 2022 Military Bowl.
Elko returned to Texas A&amp;M as their head coach in November 2023. After his departure, Trooper Taylor served as the head coach of the Blue Devils in their 2023 Birmingham Bowl victory, before following Elko to Texas A&amp;M to serve as running backs coach.
Manny Diaz era (2024–present).
On December 8, 2023, former Penn State defensive coordinator Manny Diaz became the 24th head coach of Duke football. Buoyed by a strong recruiting class and the transfer of former Texas quarterback Maalik Murphy, the Blue Devils finished Diaz's first season 9-4, including an appearance in the Gator Bowl and a sweep of in-state rivals North Carolina, NC State, and Wake Forest.
Championships.
National championships.
Duke does not officially claim any national championships. The 1936 team was retroactively named national champions by Berryman (QRPS), a mathematical rating system designed by Clyde P. Berryman in 1990. The NCAA recognizes the Berryman title in its official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision records. James Howell, a football historian, also selected Duke as 1936 national champions using his Football Power Ratings formula.
Ray Bryne, a minor selector, chose the 1941 Blue Devils as national champions.
† The 1936 Berryman (QRPS) title is recognized by the NCAA.
Conference championships.
† Co-champions
Duke also won a share of the 1965 ACC Championship on the field, finishing tied for first with South Carolina (who they defeated) at 4–2. However, the Gamecocks were stripped of all of their league wins after it emerged they had used two ineligible players. This elevated NC State and Clemson (both of whom had lost to South Carolina) to 5–2 in the standings, ahead of 4–2 Duke. While Duke still claims the 1965 conference title, the ACC does not recognize it.

Rivalries.
North Carolina.
The Blue Devils traditional all-sport rivalry is with the North Carolina. In football, the teams fight for the Victory Bell each year. The trophy series is 40–21–1 in favor of North Carolina. North Carolina leads the series is 65–41–4 through the 2023 season.
Wake Forest.
Duke maintains a rivalry with Wake Forest. This rivalry started due to the schools' historical religious affiliations and close proximity to one another (Wake Forest University was originally located in the town of Wake Forest before moving to Winston-Salem in 1956). Duke was originally known as Trinity College and the athletic teams were known as the Methodists, while Wake Forest's athletic teams were known at the time as the Baptists. The series is 60–40–2 in favor of Duke through the 2024 season. Duke won the most recent matchup in 2024 by a score of 23–17. These teams have played each other in consecutive years since 1921, one of the longest-continued rivalries in college football with both teams not skipping a beat even during WWII. 
NC State.
Duke maintains a Research Triangle rivalry with NC State. The series with NC State is 42–37–5 in favor of Duke through the 2023 season.
Facilities.
Wallace Wade Stadium.
Brooks Field at Wallace Wade Stadium is a 35,018-seat stadium on the campus of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, United States. Primarily used for American football, it is the home field of the Duke Blue Devils. It opened in 1929 with a game against Pitt, as the first facility in Duke's new West Campus. Originally named Duke Stadium, it was renamed in 1967 for former head football coach Wallace Wade and has remained Wallace Wade Stadium ever since. The field was named Brooks Field at the beginning of the 2015 season after the removal of track and lowering of the field level seats.
The stadium is notable for being the site of the 1942 Rose Bowl Game. Duke had won the invitation to the game as the eastern representative. However, the attack on Pearl Harbor, just weeks after the end of the 1941 season, led to fears of a Japanese attack on the West Coast. General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, advised the Tournament of Roses Association not to hold the game at the Rose Bowl Stadium itself, since he was not willing to take a chance on the Japanese choosing to stage a bombing raid on a stadium with over 90,000 people in attendance. Soon afterward, the government banned all large public gatherings on the West Coast, which ruled out Bell Field on the campus of Oregon State, the host team from the PCC, as an alternative venue. The Tournament of Roses Association originally planned to cancel the game, but Duke officials invited the Rose Bowl and Oregon State to Durham to play the game. The offer was accepted, and on a cold, rainy January 1, 1942, 56,000 fans, 22,000 of whom sat on bleachers borrowed from nearby NC State and UNC, watched the heavily favored Blue Devils fall to the strong defense of the Beavers 20–16. It was the only time the game has been played outside of Pasadena, California, until 2020 when the 2021 Rose Bowl was relocated to AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In September 2014, renovation plans were released. The new stadium would seat nearly 40,000 and have 21 luxury suites housed within a new five-story, 90,000 square foot tower along the stadium's west side. A new 42 feet high by 75.6 feet wide LED video board would be installed 90 feet closer to the field than the previous one. Another notable feature was the removal of the stadium's track, which allowed 4,000 additional seats to be added along with lowering and recentering the field. The concourses along the stadium's north and west sides were enhanced with new concessions and new gates, restroom facilities and first aid stations. Integrated seating in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act were also added for disabled guests and their companions. The first two phases of the renovations were finished over a two-year period, including the new press box, eight broadcast booths and suites completed by the 2016 college football season. Phase three is to be completed prior to the 2017 season. It includes completion of ADA boxes in one-third of the concourse on the north and east concourse, rebuilding the concourse surface, and construction of a north gate ticket booth and various concessions, bathroom, and future store buildings on the east concourse. The alumni box on the north concourse will also be replaced with a new auxiliary scoreboard.
Academic achievements.
Duke is consistently ranked at or near the top of the list of Division I-A schools which graduate nearly all of their football players. Duke topped the list 12 years in a row through 2006, earning it the most Academic Achievement Awards of any university. Duke has had an American Football Coaches Association's Academic Achievement Award winner in '81, '84, '87, '90, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, '99, '03, '05, '14, making it one of the schools with the most winners.

Iowa State Cyclones football

The Iowa State Cyclones football program is the intercollegiate football team at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. The team is coached by Matt Campbell. The Cyclones compete in the Big 12 Conference, and are a Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) member of the NCAA. The Cyclones play their home games at Jack Trice Stadium, with a capacity of 61,500. The Iowa State Cyclones football team drew an average home attendance of 60,384 in 2023, the 28th highest in college football.
History.
Early history (1892–1967).
Football first made its way onto the Iowa State campus in 1878 as a recreational sport, but it wasn't until 1892 that an organized group of athletes first represented Iowa State in football. In 1894, college president William M. Beardshear spearheaded the foundation of an athletic association to officially sanction Iowa State football teams. The 1894 team finished with a 6–1 mark, including a 16–8 victory over what is now the University of Iowa.
One of the pioneers of football, Pop Warner, spent time at Iowa State early in his career. In 1895 despite already being the coach at Georgia he was offered $25 per week to come to Iowa State, whose season started in mid-August while Georgia's started a month later, as well as to provide weekly advice during the rest of the season. Soon after Warner left for Georgia, Iowa State had its first game of the season. Iowa State came into Evanston as the underdog Iowa State then defeated Northwestern 36–0. A Chicago sportswriter called the team "cornfed giants from Iowa" while the "Chicago Tribune"'s headline read, "Struck by a Cyclone". Since then, Iowa State teams have been known as the Cyclones. Overall, the team had three wins and three losses and, like Georgia, Iowa State retained Warner for the next season. In 1896 the team had eight wins and two losses. Despite leaving Cornell in 1898, Warner remained as the head coach of Iowa State for another year. During his last three years at Iowa State the team had a winning season but Warner was unable to match his 1896 triumph. After playing at Iowa and then serving as an assistant coach for two years, Clyde Williams came to Ames as an assistant coach for ISU. Williams served as the Cyclones' head football coach for six seasons from 1907 to 1912. During that time, he had a coaching record of 32–15–2. This ranks him fifth at Iowa State in total wins and fourth at Iowa State in winning percentage. In addition, he led Iowa State to two Missouri Valley Conference football titles in 1911 and 1912, which are the only two conference football championships in school history. In addition to his football contributions Williams was the school's first men's basketball coach from 1908 to 1911, where he compiled a 20–29 record. He also served as Iowa State's baseball coach, and was their athletic director from 1914 to 1919. In 1914 Iowa State completed construction of their new football field and it was named Clyde Williams Field in honor of the former coach. Williams was inducted into the State of Iowa Hall of Fame in 1956. He is also one of the few people inducted into both the University of Iowa Athletics Hall of Fame (inducted 1993) and the Iowa State athletics Hall of Fame (inducted 1997). The success Iowa State found in the inception of their football program was not replicated for most of the mid-20th century. In 1922 after having two different head coaches in as many years, ISU hired up-and-comer Sam Willaman away from East Technical HS in Cleveland, OH. When Willaman came to Iowa state, he brought with him six of his former East Tech players, including Jack Trice. Trice was the first African-American player at Iowa State, and one of the first African-Americans to play football in the Midwest. Trice suffered a severe malicious injury during a game at Minnesota in 1923, and died from complications. In 1997, Iowa State's Cyclone Stadium was renamed Jack Trice Stadium in his honor, becoming the first and as of 2020, the only, major college football stadium to be named for a black man. In his first season, Willaman's team finished with a 2–6 record, but posted a winning record in each of the three years that followed. His career coaching record at Iowa state was 14–15–3. This ranks him 16th in total wins and 13th in winning percentage in Iowa State football history.
In February 1931, George F. Veenker accepted an offer to become the head football coach for Iowa State. Under Veenker, Iowa State experienced a brief period of success. When Veenker joined Iowa State, the team was coming off a winless season in 1930 and had lost 16 consecutive games dating back to October 1929. In his first year, the 1931 team defeated Missouri 20–0, Oklahoma 13–12, and Kansas State 7–6, compiling a 5–3 record and finishing in second place in the Big Six Conference. In November 1931, the "Ames Daily Tribune-Times" called Veenker "a veritable miracle man of football" for taking a school where "Cyclone football morale couldn't have been lower" and turning the program around in his first season. The highlight of Veenker's career as Iowa State's football coach was a 31–6 victory over the Iowa Hawkeyes in 1934. The game was the last meeting between the two schools until 1977. Veenker resigned in 1936, leaving an overall record of 21–22–8. Shortly after Veenker's death in 1959, the university-owned golf course was renamed Veenker Memorial Golf Course in his honor. During the 1938 season, James J. Yeager was in his second year as head coach. Despite going 3–6 in 1937, the Cyclones would go on to a then-best record of 7–1–1. The team was led by outstanding senior guard, Ed Bock. At the conclusion of the season Bock became the first consensus first-team All-American in Iowa State history. Bock was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1970. In 1942, Iowa State hired former Green Bay Packers All-Pro guard and three-time NFL champion Mike Michalske to be the new head coach. Michalske achieved moderate success in his five seasons at Iowa State, finishing with an 18–18 record. Abe Stuber took over as the Cyclones head coach in 1947 and coached the team until 1953, compiling a record of 24–38–3. Vince DiFrancesca was the 21st head coach at Iowa State, leading the team to a record of 6–21–1 from 1954 to 1956. Oregon State assistant coach Clay Stapleton was the head football coach at Iowa State for ten seasons. He is known mainly for his 1959 team the "Dirty Thirty". The Cyclones' struggles continued under his tutelage. Seven-win campaigns in 1959 and 1960 were the only winning seasons of his tenure. Stapleton was relieved of his duties following the 1967 season.
Johnny Majors era (1968–1972).
In 1968, in an attempt to turn the team around, Iowa State hired former standout Tennessee running back and up-and-coming Arkansas assistant Johnny Majors as the 24th head coach in program history. The rebuilding process got off to a slow start as the Cyclones finished 3–7 in his first two seasons. In 1970 the process started moving forward, and the team finished tied for 6th in the Big Eight with a record of 5–6. The 1971 team was picked to finish last in the Big Eight, but overcame odds to finish 4–3 in the conference and 8–3 in the regular season. The only teams they lost to in the conference, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Colorado, ended up first, second, and third in the final rankings. The team was led by junior running back George Amundson, who Majors called "the finest athlete I have coached in any job I have had." Iowa State had one defensive all-conference pick, LB Keith Schroeder. Amundson rushed for 1,260 yards, including a school-record 15 touchdowns. End Keith Krepfle had 40 receptions for 570 yards and 12 touchdowns. Quarterback Dean Carlson threw for a school-record 1,867 yards. These efforts were enough to earn a bid to the 1971 Sun Bowl, the first bowl game in program history. Iowa State was slated to play against LSU on December 18, 1971. Iowa State was outmatched by LSU and future NFL quarterback Bert Jones, falling to the Tigers, 33–15. LSU was ranked 11 after the bowls, but Iowa State was left out of the top 20.
In 1972, Iowa State saw the loss of five starters and the move of George Amundson from running back to quarterback to replace Dean Carlson. The Cyclones lost linebacker Matt Blair to a pre-season injury, which forced him into a medical redshirt. The Cyclones tied Nebraska 23–23 on a missed extra point by Iowa State's Tom Goedjen. Three players went on to be named to the first team All-Big Eight team as well be honored as All-Americans, offensive lineman Geary Murdoch, defensive end Merv Krakau and quarterback George Amundson. Amundson was named Big Eight player of the year over Heisman Trophy winner, Johnny Rodgers. It was in this year that Iowa State became known as D-Tackle U, similar to Penn State's moniker "Linebacker U". Iowa State's 5–5–1 regular season record was enough to earn them an invitation to the 1972 Liberty Bowl against Georgia Tech. Despite outstanding play, Iowa State lost 31–30 on a failed late-game two-point conversion attempt by George Amundson. At the conclusion of the 1972 season, Majors announced his departure from Iowa State to take the head coaching job at Pittsburgh.
Earle Bruce era (1973–1978).
In order to continue the success experienced under Johnny Majors Iowa State hired Earle Bruce out of Tampa. With newfound excitement around ISU football, the university broke ground on a new $7.6 million stadium that would eventually become Jack Trice Stadium. Despite future Minnesota Vikings star linebacker Matt Blair being a first team All-American, the Cyclones struggled to a 4–7 finish in Bruce's inaugural 1973 season. Over the next two seasons the Cyclones experienced moderate success but both seasons ended again with 4–7 records. However, Bruce's fourth team blossomed as one of the best teams in school history. En route to their 8–3 final record, the Cyclones scored wins against No. 7 Missouri and No. 9 Nebraska. In spite of the Cyclones' finishing the 1976 season ranked No. 19 in the AP Poll, Iowa State was ultimately snubbed by the bowls. Even so, Bruce was selected as Big Eight Coach of the Year. Iowa State followed up their strong 1976 campaign with another eight-win season in 1977. The Cyclones beat No. 9 Nebraska for the second time in a row and were ranked as high as No. 16 in the AP Poll at one point. Their 5–2 conference record and 8–4 overall record were good enough for a bid to the 1977 Peach Bowl against North Carolina State. Ultimately Iowa State lost the game 14–24. The Cyclones returned 14 starters from the 1977 Peach Bowl team including Heisman Trophy candidate, Dexter Green and Outland Trophy hopeful, Mike Stensrud. Iowa State's post season hopes came down to their last game against Colorado which was nationally televised. The game was close throughout, with ISU clinging to a 17–10 halftime lead. The second half was a defensive battle, but the ISU defense came up with big plays down the stretch. Mike Stensrud had 16 stops and caused a fumble to help ISU preserve a 20–16 win over the Buffaloes. The win earned ISU a bid to the 1978 Hall of Fame Classic against Texas A&amp;M. Iowa State opened the game with two touchdowns, but was unable to convert the extra point on either attempt. The Cyclones were not able to contain future first round NFL draft pick Curtis Dickey, who rushed for 278 yards and a touchdown, and Iowa State lost 28–12. At the conclusion of the 1978 season, Bruce announced he would leave Iowa State to take the head coaching job at Ohio State.
Donnie Duncan era (1979–1982).
In order to continue the success found under Earle Bruce, Iowa State hired Oklahoma assistant Donnie Duncan as its 26th head football coach. He held the position for four seasons, from 1979 until 1982. His 1980 and 1981 Cyclones squads both made appearances in the national rankings. The 1981 Cyclones began the season at 5–1–1 and rose to No. 11 in the AP Poll. Led by future NFL players Dwayne Crutchfield, Dan Johnson, Karl Nelson and Chris Washington, the Cyclones tied No. 5 Oklahoma 7–7 and downed No. 8 Missouri 34–13. However, the success was short lived, and Duncan resigned with a career record of 18–24–2 after the 1982 season.
Jim Criner era (1983–1986).
Following the 1982 season Iowa State hired Jim Criner, who had won the 1980 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship as the head coach at Boise State. During Criner's tenure the Cyclones experienced mild success, however they were embroiled in controversy, with multiple players arrested on different charges as well as several NCAA allegations of wrongdoings. The allegations included coaches giving players cash as well as giving recruits rides and meals. Criner's rough tenure came to an end November 12, 1986, when the school announced his firing. Criner's final career record at Iowa State was 17–25–2.
Jim Walden era (1987–1994).
Jim Walden succeeded Jim Criner at Iowa State, where he compiled a 28–57–3 over eight seasons. ISU had been hit with scholarship reductions by the NCAA, both because of infractions by the previous coach, and an overall reduction in scholarships for Division I-A for the 1988 season. In his first four years as Iowa State's head coach, he had just 57, 61, 63, and 67 scholarship players. Walden had only 47 scholarship players on the squad that he took to Lincoln to play Nebraska on October 28, 1989, and they lost 49–17. Walden was the last Iowa State coach to defeat Oklahoma, until Matt Campbell, which they did on October 20, 1990. Oklahoma was ranked 16th in the nation at the time. They had narrowly missed an upset the year before, losing in Ames 43–40. Walden's best record with the Cyclones was 6–5 in 1989. After the 1989 season, Walden was offered the head coaching job at the University of Arizona, but he declined, citing a number of people at Iowa State telling him it would be "devastating" if he left. In retrospect, Walden said he was "too dumb" to leave.
Walden's teams were plagued with injuries, especially at quarterback. In 1991, third-string quarterback Kevin Caldwell, who had begun the season as a tailback, started the final five games under center for the Cyclones. Walden played four different quarterbacks in a 41–0 loss to Kansas in 1991. In 1992, Walden installed the triple-option offense and had mixed results. Iowa State lost to in-state rivals Iowa and UNI early in the 1992 season. The loss to UNI was Walden's first to a Division I-AA school. It was also UNI's first victory over the Cyclones since 1900. Iowa State bounced back to shock the seventh-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers at home on November 14, 1992. The victory was even more improbable as Walden's third-string quarterback, Marv Seiler, would make his first career start. Walden's 1993 squad went 3–8, but with an upset of 18th ranked Kansas State. Walden ended the 1993 campaign with a walk-on quarterback, Jeff St. Clair.
In the spring of 1994, Walden recruited running back Troy Davis out of Miami, Florida. Davis later had consecutive 2,000-yard rushing seasons, but not until after Walden's departure. After starting the 1994 campaign 0–2, many fans began to criticize Walden's coaching ability. He began his weekly press conference by handing out the records of Dennis Erickson, Johnny Majors, and Earle Bruce while they were at Washington State and Iowa State. He then handed out Iowa State's overall record in football since fielding its first team in 1892, which, at the time, was 423–461–45, a .480 percentage, and compared his record to that one. Walden claimed that he was as good a coach or better than Erickson, Majors, and Bruce. On Thursday, November 3, 1994, after starting the season 0–7–1, Walden informed his team that he would resign at season's end. He was allowed to coach his final three games by the university, but was banned from coaching his last game at Colorado because of criticizing the officials after the Kansas State game. Kansas State's Nyle Wiren had body-slammed Walden's quarterback Todd Doxzon into the turf head first. No penalty was called and Walden, with nothing to lose, went off on the officiating after the game: "I've kept quiet too long, but since I'm leaving there's nothing they can do about me. I think the refereeing in this league is atrocious ... What do you do with bad officials? Do they get fired? You fire bad players and bad coaches. Bad officials get a raise and go fishing." Walden coached his final game on November 12 against Nebraska in Ames. Iowa State had an 0–8–1 record and Nebraska was undefeated, with a No. 1 ranking. Unbelievably, Walden's Cyclones hung with the Huskers. At the end of the third quarter, Nebraska led by only two points, 14–12. The final quarter proved to be too much for Walden's team, and Nebraska won the game 28–12. The Cyclones finished with a winless 0–10–1 record in Walden's final 1994 season. Walden ranks sixth at Iowa State in total wins and 22nd in winning percentage.
Dan McCarney era (1995–2006).
To turn the program around Iowa State hired Wisconsin defensive coordinator, Dan McCarney. The lone bright spot that McCarney inherited was sophomore running back phenom Troy Davis. Davis would go on to break nearly every Iowa State rushing and touchdown record, most that still stand. Davis twice earned unanimous All-American honors, and became the first NCAA Division I-A running back to rush for over 2,000 yards in back-to-back seasons, a feat that has yet to be repeated. Davis finished 5th and 2nd in Heisman voting in his 1995 and 1996 campaigns respectively. McCarney would go 10–34 in his first four seasons as the Cyclones head coach. In McCarney's sixth season, the Cyclones were finally able to put together a competitive team. The 2000 Cyclones were quarterbacked by Sage Rosenfels. Sage is among many former Cyclones from the 2000 team to make it to the NFL. Others were J. J. Moses, Reggie Hayward, Ennis Haywood, Tony Yelk, Mike Banks, Jordan Carstens, Tyson Smith and James Reed. Despite Iowa State being picked by the media to finish 5th in the Big 12 North Division, the Cyclones finished with a 5–3 conference record and a 9–3 overall record. ISU finished the season ranked No. 25 and their nine wins were the program's best total since 1906. The Cyclones were then invited to play in the Insight.com Bowl against Pittsburgh, Iowa State's first appearance in a bowl game since the 1978 Peach Bowl. Iowa State was able to beat the Panthers 37–29, earning their first bowl victory in program history. In an interesting side note, Pittsburgh's defensive coordinator in this game, Paul Rhoads, would eventually become the 31st Iowa State head coach.
The 2001 season saw the emergence of JUCO transfer Seneca Wallace and star wide receiver Lane Danielson. The dynamic duo led the Cyclones to a last-second win over Iowa, a 7–5 overall record, and an invitation to the Independence Bowl against Alabama, their second consecutive bowl game. The Cyclones just missed a 47-yard field goal attempt with 0:46 remaining in the fourth, which would have given State the lead and potential victory. The Cyclones lost the game 13–14. Subsequent to the game there was some question about whether or not the field goal was actually good, as it sailed directly over one of the uprights. Seneca Wallace would lead the Cyclones to a 6–1 start in 2002, including a near-win against the Florida State Seminoles in the Eddie Robinson Classic at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. Wallace dove towards the goal line at the last second but was ruled out shy of the end zone. During a later home game versus Texas Tech, Wallace scored on a 12-yard touchdown by running an estimated 120 yards backwards, forwards, and sideways on the field. Wallace dodged tackles and received numerous blocks from his teammates, including one devastating block by running back Michael Wagner. The play briefly catapulted Wallace into Heisman Trophy contention and was recognized by ESPN as the "Play of the Week." It has since been recognized as one of the great plays in college football history. The play is known among Iowa State fans simply as "The Run." Ultimately their 7–7 record was enough to receive a bid to the Humanitarian Bowl against Boise State on the Broncos' blue home field where they were defeated, 16–34.
The 2004 season would be much more successful than the disappointing 2–10 2003 campaign for the Cyclones. Redshirt freshman Bret Meyer took over the quarterback spot and paired up with fellow redshirt freshman receiver Todd Blythe to make a lethal combination. The season got off to a slow start with a 2–4 overall record and a 0–3 record in the conference. McCarney turned the season around by winning the next four games in a row. The Cyclones had a chance to win the Big 12 North title but fell short after a Missouri defender intercepted a pass intended for Jon Davis in the end zone. The Cyclones would go on to play the Miami RedHawks in the 2004 Independence Bowl. In the Independence Bowl, Iowa State prevailed for a 17–13 win as Meyer rolled up 236 yards of total offense. Meyer and Stevie Hicks each rushed for over 100 yards, an Independence Bowl first. All-Big 12 cornerback Ellis Hobbs iced the win with a 41-yard interception return in the game's final minute, and the Cyclones held on to win 17–13. The Cyclones continued their success under McCarney in the 2005 season. High points during the season include a blowout win against No. 8 Iowa and a home victory over No. 22 Colorado. They missed out yet again on the Big 12 title when they lost in overtime to Kansas after a missed field goal by Bret Culbertson. They led the game in the 4th quarter but allowed Kansas to come back. The Cyclones earned a berth in the 2005 Houston Bowl, but lost 24–27 to the TCU Horned Frogs. TCU opened the game with back-to-back first quarter rushing touchdowns. The Cyclones responded with two Bret Meyer touchdown passes and forced a TCU safety. Late in the fourth quarter the game was tied at 24–24 but the Cyclones ultimately suffered yet another bowl loss on a fourth-quarter field goal. McCarney stepped down as head coach after a 4–8 2006 season, and finished his Iowa State head-coaching career as the program's winningest head coach with a 56–85 all-time record.
Gene Chizik year (2007–2008).
To replace Dan McCarney, Iowa State hired much-touted Texas defensive coordinator Gene Chizik. The Cyclones wore 1977 throwback jerseys for the 2007 contest against Iowa and re-introduced gold pants as a standard part of their uniform. It marked the 30th anniversary since the resumption of the Cy-Hawk rivalry as well as the 30th anniversary of the 1977 Iowa State Peach Bowl team. They finished the season 3–9, including a 15–13 win over Iowa, and back-to-back wins against Kansas State and Colorado. All three wins were upsets. In 2008, Iowa State opened with two wins against weaker non-conference foes, before losing their next 10 games to finish the season 2–10. Chizik left the Cyclones suddenly after the season to become the head football coach at Auburn amid great acrimony.
Paul Rhoads era (2009–2015).
Auburn defensive coordinator Paul Rhoads was introduced as the 31st head coach of the Iowa State Cyclones on December 20, 2008. Rhoads had previously spent time at Iowa State as an assistant coach in the late 1990s and was raised only 20 miles from Ames in Ankeny. His father, Cecil, was one of the winningest coaches in Iowa high school history, coaching for more than three decades and has been inducted into the Iowa High School Football Coaches Hall of Fame. Rhoads' contract was reported to be a 5-year deal worth $5.75 million plus incentives. To round out his coaching staff, Rhoads hired up-and-coming offensive coordinator out of Rice, Tom Herman and veteran defensive coordinator Wally Burnham.
Rhoads opened his ISU career with a win over FCS North Dakota State. He then led Iowa State to a victory at Kent State first year, ending a 17-game Cyclones road losing streak. In October 2009 the Cyclones defeated Baylor to end an 11-game losing stretch against conference opponents, and then went on to defeat Nebraska in Lincoln for the first time since 1977. Their 6–6 record was enough to earn them an invitation to the Insight.com Bowl against Minnesota. Rhoads would win his first bowl game in his inaugural year as coach at Iowa State, beating the Golden Gophers 14–13. The lone highlight of the 2010 season was the first ever win at Texas in school history, upsetting the 22nd-ranked Longhorns 28–21. The Cyclones would finish the season 3–5 in the Big 12 and 5–7 overall.
In 2011 Iowa State started off the season 3–0 including a triple-overtime win over Iowa in Ames, and a win over Connecticut in East Hartford. The Cyclones would drop the next four games, starting out 0–4 in conference play, but they quickly bounced back with a 41–7 win on October 29 at No. 19 Texas Tech. In that game, Iowa State managed to rack up 512 total yards, the most since the Nov 22, 2008 game at Kansas State. Several other school records were broken, including first-ever win in Lubbock, largest margin of victory against a ranked opponent, and most points scored against a ranked opponent since November 9, 1996. On November 18, Iowa State faced off against undefeated No. 2 Oklahoma State led by Heisman frontrunner Brandon Weeden and two-time Biletnikoff winner Justin Blackmon in Ames. Down 24–7 early in the second half, Iowa State came back with 17 unanswered points to force overtime. In overtime, Iowa State scored on its first play from scrimmage, but Oklahoma State answered back with their own touchdown. In the second overtime, Iowa State forced an interception and ran three Jeff Woody dives in a row to beat Oklahoma State 37–31, smashing Oklahoma State's chances of playing for a national championship and Brandon Weeden's Heisman shot. Iowa State became bowl eligible with the win and improved to 6–4. The win over Oklahoma State marked Iowa State's first ever win against an opponent in the top 6 (AP polls). The Cyclones finished the season 6–6 and would receive an invitation to face the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in the Pinstripe Bowl, which they went on to lose, 27–13.
The Cyclones opened the 2012 season 3–0 including a 9–6 win at Iowa for the first time in 10 years. The other major highlight of the season was ending TCU's then-longest winning streak in college football by upsetting the No. 15 ranked Horned Frogs in Fort Worth 37–23. The 2012 season ended 6–7 and a berth in that year's Liberty Bowl against the Tulsa Golden Hurricane. Iowa State opened the game strong but they ultimately lost 31–17. While things appeared to be moving in a positive direction for the Cyclones, Rhoads' future teams were unable to continue the success of his earlier teams. In his final three seasons, the Cyclones won just four Big 12 games (including a winless conference record in 2014) and went 8–27 overall. The 2015 season proved to be particularly difficult, as the Cyclones held double-digit halftime leads against both Oklahoma State and Kansas State only to lose both games late in the fourth quarter. Following a 38–35 loss to Kansas State on November 21, in which he came under heavy criticism for play-calling in the game's final 90 seconds, Rhoads was fired as head coach, effective at the conclusion of the season.
Matt Campbell era (2016–present).
Matt Campbell, who had been the head coach at the University of Toledo, was named head coach at Iowa State on November 29, 2015. Campbell signed a six-year contract worth $2 million his first year. Campbell finished his first season as a Cyclone with a record of 3–9. Despite the disappointing record there were several high points during the season that showed progress including several near upsets and a blowout win over Texas Tech. The 66–10 rout of the Red Raiders included breaking several school records including points scored in a conference game.
In Campbell's second season, the Cyclones experienced greater on-field success. After opening the season 2–2, the Cyclones upset the eventual conference champions the No. 3 ranked Oklahoma Sooners. This was Iowa State's first win in Norman since 1990 and only their sixth win against Oklahoma all-time. They followed up the Oklahoma win by going undefeated in the month of October, including a win over No. 4 TCU. During the season the Cyclones were ranked as high as No. 14 in the AP Poll. Finishing the regular season 7–5 and fourth in the Big 12, Iowa State was invited to the Liberty Bowl where they defeated No. 20 Memphis 21–20, their first bowl victory in eight years. Campbell agreed to a six-year, $22.5 million extension with the school on November 27, 2017. On November 30, 2017, Campbell was named the Big 12 Coach of the Year. In the 2018 season, the Cyclones had a disappointing 1–3 start. However, coach Campbell lead the Cyclones to a regular season record of 8–4, including 6 Big 12 conference wins, and a win over No. 6 West Virginia. The Cyclones were invited to the Alamo Bowl, where they lost 28–26 to Washington State. On December 3, 2019, Campbell and Iowa State agreed to a contract extension through 2025.
Featuring Quarterback Brock Purdy, and All-American Running Back Breece Hall, the 2020 season was one of the most successful seasons in Cyclones history. Despite losing their season opener to the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns from the Sun Belt Conference, they recovered quickly and defeated No. 18 Oklahoma two weeks later in Ames. Two weeks later, the No. 17 Cyclones lost to No. 6 Oklahoma State 24–21 in Stillwater. This would be their only conference loss for the season, as they went on to win the rest of their regular season games and clinched a spot in their first-ever Big 12 Championship Game, a rematch with No. 10 Oklahoma. At the time of the Big 12 Championship Game, the Cyclones were ranked No. 6 in the College Football Playoff rankings, their highest CFP ranking ever. Although the Cyclones lost this game 27–21, they were invited to the Fiesta Bowl, where they defeated the No. 25 Oregon Ducks 34–17 in their first-ever New Year's Six bowl game. After the season ended, the Cyclones finished ranked No. 9 in both the AP and Coaches Poll, their highest final ranking ever. On February 8, 2021, Campbell and Iowa State agreed to a contract extension through 2028.
In 2023, the Cyclones team became embroiled in an illegal sports-betting scandal. 
Both defensive lineman Isaiah Lee and the Cyclones’ leading rusher for the 2022 season Jirehl Brock were charged following an investigation into illegal sports betting, and they subsequently left the team.
Three other players charged in the investigation were quarterback Hunter Dekkers, offensive lineman Jacob Remsburg and tight end DeShawn Hanika all of which remained on the team roster, with Remsburg being the only to play again for the Cyclones. Despite the scandal, the Cyclones were able to finish with a winning record and a trip to a bowl game after being led by newly starting quarterback Rocco Becht and first year offensive coordinator Nathan Scheelhaase.

Individual accomplishments.
First team All-Americans.
Every year, several publications release lists of their ideal "team". The athletes on these lists are referred to as All-Americans. The NCAA recognizes five All-American lists. They are the Associated Press (AP), American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), "Sporting News" ("TSN"), and the Walter Camp Football Foundation (WCFF). Since the establishment of the team in 1892, Iowa State has had 16 players honored a total of 24 times as First Team All-America for their performance on the field of play. Included in these selections are 6 consensus selections, with four individuals earning the honor (Troy Davis and Breece Hall having earned the honor twice).
College Football Hall of Fame inductees.
In 1951, the College Football Hall of Fame opened in South Bend, Indiana. Since then, Iowa State has had two players inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Ed Bock is widely considered the greatest offensive lineman in Iowa State history. During his 1938 senior season the team finished with a then best 7–1–1 record. At the conclusion of the season Bock became the first consensus first team All-American in ISU history. Following his football career at Iowa State Bock worked for the Monsanto Chemical Company where he eventually rose to become CEO and President. Bock was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1970.
Troy Davis is considered the greatest running back in Iowa State history. Davis twice earned consensus All-American honors and was the first NCAA Division I-A running back to rush for over 2,000 yards in back-to-back seasons, a feat that has yet to be repeated. Davis finished 5th and 2nd in Heisman voting in his sophomore and junior seasons, respectively. After completing his college career, Davis went on to have a 10-year career in the NFL and CFL, including as a member of the Edmonton Eskimos 2005 Grey Cup championship team. Davis was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in the class of 2016.
Heisman Trophy.
The Heisman Trophy is awarded annually to the nation's most outstanding college football player. In 1959 after Dwight Nichols led the Big 7 in total yardage (1,358) and points (54) he became the first player in Iowa State history to receive Heisman votes coming tied for 7th place overall. After his stellar 1972 campaign George Amundson became the second player in ISU history to receive Heisman votes when he finished in 7th place. In 1995 after a 23-year absence Troy Davis became the third Cyclone to gain Heisman attention when he finished 5th. Then in 1996 at the conclusion of his second consecutive 2,000 yard season Davis nearly won the Heisman but ultimately was runner-up. In 2020, Breece Hall became the fourth Cyclone to receive Heisman votes when he finished in 6th place.
Rivalries.
Iowa.
Iowa and Iowa State played each other 24 times between 1894 and 1934, before the Cy-Hawk Trophy was established. It was originally conceived and created as a traveling trophy by the Greater Des Moines Athletic Club in 1976, the trophy was first presented to the winner by Iowa Governor Robert D. Ray in 1977. That game was the first meeting between the two since 1934. The series halted after 1934 after then University of Iowa Athletic Director and head football coach Ossie Solem would not return calls to reschedule the rivalry. The rivalry was once again temporarily put to a halt in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 69 games in the series played through 2022, 40 of them have been played in Iowa City while 29 games have been contested in Ames. Iowa leads the series 47–24 through the 2024 season.
Kansas State.
The teams first met in 1917, when both schools were members of the Big Eight Conference. The match-up continued as an annual conference game through the schools' shift into the Big 12 Conference. The series has been dominated by long winning streaks for both teams, with each team's longest winning streak at 10 games. Iowa State leads the series 54–50–4 through the 2024 season.
Missouri.
Missouri and Iowa State first met in 1896 and the regional rivalry was born. Before the 1959 match-up between the two schools, which took place in Ames, Iowa, field testing showed that the telephones the two schools used to communicate with their coaches in the coaches box were wired so that either school could hear what was happening on the other sideline. The problem was fixed before the game, but neither of the two coaches knew that. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company of Ames then decided to have a trophy made to commemorate the incident, and thus the Telephone Trophy was born. When Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC the rivalry was essentially ended. Missouri leads the rivalry 61–34–9 all-time.
Nebraska.
The teams first met in 1896, and played each uninterrupted from 1926 to 2010. A natural rivalry developed between the two bordering state schools in the Midwest, but the series has been very one-sided towards Nebraska, especially during the Tom Osborne era. The series was put a halt after Nebraska joined the Big Ten in 2011. Nebraska leads the series 85–18–2 through the 2024 season.
Facilities.
Jack Trice Stadium.
Jack Trice Stadium (formerly Cyclone Stadium) is a stadium in Ames, Iowa. It is primarily used for college football, and is the home field of the Iowa State University Cyclones. It opened on September 20, 1975 (with a win against Air Force), and with hillside tickets it officially has 61,500 seats. The current record for single-game attendance, 61,500, was set on September 5, 2015, when the Cyclones played Northern Iowa. In 1997, the stadium was named in honor of Jack Trice, ISU's first African American athlete and the school's first athletics-related fatality. The stadium is the only stadium in Division I named for an African American individual.
Bergstrom Indoor Training Facility.
The Steve and Debbie Bergstrom Indoor Training Facility opened in March 2004. It is a multi-purpose, indoor practice facility. Inside the facility is a full-sized football field. Though typically associated with football, it is also used for practice by the softball and soccer teams, as well as community events. The building sits just northwest of Jack Trice Stadium and is part of the Johnny Majors Practice Complex. The facility cost $9.6 million to build and was funded by private gifts to the athletic department and ISU Foundation.
On October 26, 2012, Iowa State dedicated a $20.6 million, 156,000 square-foot, expansion of the football facility with an additional lead gift from the Bergstrom family. This included replacing the playing surface of the indoor facility, a state-of-the-art strength and conditional facility, a coaches office complex, positional meeting rooms, an auditorium, and spacious locker rooms. This completed the goal for Iowa State to have a stand-alone football-only training facility.
Jacobson Athletic Building.
Built in 1995 and located off the north end zone of Jack Trice Stadium, The Jacobson Athletic Building formerly housed the football offices, locker rooms, meeting rooms, strength and conditioning room, and sports medicine room. The space was renovated in 2008 and 2009 to use the vacated space by the football team. It now is home to men's and women's golf, tennis, swimming, wrestling, cross country and track and field. This allows the entire athletic department staff to be under one roof with the exception of men's and women's basketball and volleyball.
Pageantry and traditions.
Team name.
Originally, the Iowa Agricultural College (Iowa State University) teams were known as the "Cardinals." The name was changed after Sept. 29, 1895, when under legendary coach Pop Warner the Cardinals routed the Northwestern Wildcats, 36–0. Inspired by an extremely active tornado (then called "cyclone") season, the next day, the Chicago Tribune headline read: "Struck by a Cyclone." The article went on to say, "Northwestern might as well have tried to play football with an Iowa cyclone as with the team it met yesterday." Since then the Iowa State teams have been known as the "Cyclones."
Jack Trice.
Jack Trice was Iowa State's first African-American athlete; he was also the first and only Iowa State athlete to die from injuries sustained during athletic competition. He died three days after his first game playing for Iowa State against the University of Minnesota on October 6, 1923. He suffered a broken collarbone early on, but continued to play until he was trampled by a group of Minnesota players. It is disputed whether he was trampled on purpose or if it was an accident. A statue commemorates him outside of the stadium that is named for him, Jack Trice Stadium. His legacy was forgotten until the 1970s, when students discovered a plaque commemorating him in State Gym. They decided to put up a petition to name the stadium, at the time known as Cyclones Stadium, after him. Originally they got the field named after him in 1984. The stadium was named Jack Trice Stadium in 1997. It is the only NCAA Division I stadium named after an African-American.
Cannon.
The members of the Iowa State Chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi man and maintain a cannon that is discharged at home football games when the Iowa State team takes the field, following the first kickoff, the kickoff following half-time, all Iowa State kickoffs, and immediately following an Iowa State touchdown.
Mascot.
Iowa State uses a cardinal, named Cy, as its mascot instead of an actual tornado or Cyclone. In 1954, the student pep council began the process of creating a mascot to build school spirit. As it would be difficult to, quote "stuff a cyclone", a cardinal was selected from the school's official colors and original team namesake. The name of Cy was selected via a naming contest, being submitted by 17 people.
Prior to the football matchup against the University of Colorado on November 12, 2005, a tornado touched down in Ames, Iowa, and forced fans to either stand out in the parking lot and watch the storm or flee to shelter in Hilton Coliseum. It created such an atmosphere that Iowa State was able to win over the favored Buffaloes 30–16. When asked about the event, Colorado coach Gary Barnett said, "I thought we had a pretty good mascot. But when we showed up at Iowa State and they had a real tornado, that's the real deal."
Tailgating.
Iowa State is well regarded for tailgating. The layout of Jack Trice Stadium on a flood-plain accommodates ample parking space immediately surrounding the stadium. Cyclone fans typically arrive hours before kick-off in large SUVs and RVs to grill popular Midwestern foods such as pork loin, bratwurst, hamburgers, corn and hot dogs.
Victory bell.
Located immediately outside and north of Jack Trice Stadium, the victory bell is rung following a Cyclone victory. Forged in 1890 the victory bell served on campus to signal dismissal from classes before being moved to Clyde Williams Field and subsequently to Jack Trice Stadium.
Tornado siren.
To go along with the installation of the new video board and sound system prior to the 2011 football season, a tornado siren is sounded after touchdowns, defensive stands, and other big plays. While the tornado siren is a new tradition, it is one that numerous Cyclones fans have asked the Iowa State athletic director to implement for many years, especially since the Colorado-Iowa State game of November 12, 2005, when a tornado touched down in Ames and sirens were heard throughout town during what normally would have been pregame activities. Since then, its implementation has become an extremely popular aspect of the Jack Trice Stadium experience.

Texas Tech Red Raiders football

The Texas Tech Red Raiders football program is a college football team that represents Texas Tech University (variously "TTU"). The Red Raiders competes as a member of the Big 12 Conference, which is a Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The program began in 1925 and has an overall winning record, including a total of 11 conference titles and one division title. On November 8, 2021, Joey McGuire was hired as the team's 17th head football coach, replacing Matt Wells, who was fired in the middle of the 2021 season. Home games are played at Jones AT&amp;T Stadium in Lubbock, Texas.
History.
Texas Tech (then known as Texas Technological College) fielded its first intercollegiate football team during the 1925 season. The team was known as the "Matadors" from 1925 to 1936, a name suggested by the wife of E. Y. Freeland, the first football coach, to reflect the influence of the Spanish Renaissance architecture on campus. In 1932, Texas Tech joined the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, also known as the Border Conference. The school's short-lived Matadors moniker was replaced officially in 1937 with "Red Raiders", a nickname bestowed upon them by a sportswriter impressed by their bright scarlet uniforms that remains to this day. That same year, the team won its first conference championship and was invited to the Sun Bowl. The game was played on January 1, 1938, and resulted in a 7–6 loss to the West Virginia Mountaineers. Texas Tech suffered four more bowl losses before their first postseason win in the 1952 Sun Bowl. Before withdrawing from the Border Conference in 1956, the Red Raiders won eight conference championships and one co-championship, the most held by a Border Conference member.
In 1956, Texas Tech was admitted to the Southwest Conference (SWC), but was ineligible for any title during a four-year probationary period. It gained full SWC membership and began official conference play in 1960. The Red Raiders won conference co-championships in 1976 and 1994. The team remained in the SWC until the conference dissolved in 1996. The university was invited and became a charter member in the South Division of the Big 12 Conference. Texas Tech was the only member of the Big 12 to boast a winning record every year from the conference's formation in 1996 through end 2010. In 2003, Texas Tech was the only team to ever have 5 or more players with at least 60 receptions in a single season. In 2008, the Red Raiders were one of three football teams involved in the first three way conference division tie.
Conference affiliations.
Texas Tech has competed as a member of three different conferences since 1925.
Championships.
Conference championships.
The Red Raiders have won 11 conference championships, eight outright and three shared.
† Co-championship
Division championships.
The Red Raiders were previously members of the Big 12 between its inception in 1996 and the dissolution of conference divisions within the Big 12 in 2011. They won one division championship during that span, sharing it with Oklahoma and Texas in 2008.
† Co-championship
Head coaches.
Texas Tech has had 17 head coaches, and three-interim head coaches. Five coaches have won conference championships with the Red Raiders: Pete Cawthon, Dell Morgan, DeWitt Weaver, Steve Sloan, and Spike Dykes. Mike Leach is the only head Texas Tech football coach to win a division title. Dykes is the all-time leader in games and years coached, while Leach is the all-time leader in overall wins. Higginbotham is, in terms of winning percentage, the worst coach the Red Raiders have had; winning only one game while losing seven, and tying two, giving him a .200 winning percentage. Cawthon's .693 winning percent ranks as the highest among the coaches.
Morgan, Weaver, Dykes, and Leach have each received Coach of the Year honors from at least one organization. Morgan was named Border Conference Coach of the Year in 1949. Twice—in 1951 and 1953—Weaver was named the Border Conference's Coach of the Year. Dykes was named Southwest Conference Coach of the Year in 1989 and two other years. Dykes was also named the first Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year in 1996. In 2008, Leach was the second Texas Tech head coach to be named Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year. The same season, Leach was also named the FieldTurf/Howie Long Coach of the Year and was awarded the Woody Hayes Trophy and George Munger Award; all three awards recognize the top collegiate coach of the season. Kliff Kingsbury became the first Big 12 Conference coach to begin his career with 7 wins in 2013.
Bowl games.
Texas Tech has played in 42 postseason bowl games with an all-time record of 17 wins, 24 losses, and 1 tie. The Red Raiders rank third among current Big 12 Conference programs in bowl game appearances, and also boasted the distinction of being the only program in the conference to be bowl eligible every season from its formation in 1996 through the 2010 season. The 42 bowl game appearances by the Red Raiders tie the program at 22nd in all-time in bowl games played and 31st in all-time bowl wins. Only 4 head coaches, E. Y. Freeland, Grady Higginbotham, Rex Dockery, and Jerry Moore, did not lead Texas Tech to a postseason bowl game. Although both Pete Cawthon and Dell Morgan had led the program to previous bowl games, neither posted wins in their five combined appearances.
The Red Raiders' fans have set attendance records at 10 bowl games, including the team's first bowl game appearance in the 1938 Sun Bowl. Although eight of the 10 attendance records were eventually broken, attendance records from 2 bowl game appearances, the 2004 Pacific Life Holiday Bowl and 2009 AT&amp;T Cotton Bowl Classic, remain unbroken. The 2009 AT&amp;T Cotton Bowl Classic's attendance record of 88,175 was the second-most attended bowl game of the 2008–09 bowl game season.
Texas Tech's first bowl game was at the conclusion of the 1937 season, only 13 years after the program was established. The Red Raiders played in the 1938 Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, against the West Virginia Mountaineers on New Year's Day. Nine of Texas Tech's 39 bowl game bids have been to the Sun Bowl, the most appearances by any team to the second-oldest college football bowl game. In the 1952 Sun Bowl, DeWitt Weaver coached the Red Raiders to their first bowl victory, defeating the Pacific Tigers 25–14 .
The 2011 TicketCity Bowl occurred on January 1, 2011, when the Red Raiders won, 45–38, against the Northwestern Wildcats. The game was the team's 11th consecutive bowl appearance that began with the 2000 Galleryfurniture.com Bowl, in former head coach Mike Leach's first season. In 10 seasons, Mike Leach's 9 bowl game appearances and five wins are the most of any of the program's head coaches.
The 2012 Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas occurred on December 28, 2012, when the Red Raiders won, 34–31, against the Minnesota Golden Gophers. The last time the two teams had met was during the 2006 Insight Bowl, in which Texas Tech completed the biggest comeback in bowl history. After falling behind 38–7 with 7:47 remaining in the third quarter, rallied to score 31 unanswered points to send the game to overtime. In the 2006 game, the Gophers scored a field goal in overtime, but the Red Raiders responded with a touchdown to win.
The 2013 National University Holiday Bowl occurred on December 30, 2013. This was Kliff Kingsbury's first season as head coach at Texas Tech. The Red Raiders won, 37–23, against the Arizona State Sun Devils. The last, and only other, time these two teams met was in 1999, in both teams' preseason opener despite both teams having been members of the Border Conference. In this Holiday Bowl meeting, the Red Raiders led the entire game, with the smallest lead of 7 points only lasting 11 seconds on the game clock, as Reginald Davis III returned a 90-yard kickoff for a touchdown, to answer the Sun Devils' Taylor Kelly's 44-yard touchdown run, early in the third quarter.
Texas Tech's most recent bowl victory is the 2022 TaxAct Texas Bowl. On December 28, 2022, the Red Raiders, led by head coach Joey McGuire, won 42–25 versus the former No. 9 Ole Miss Rebels led by coach Lane Kiffin.
Honors and achievements.
Ring of Honor.
In 2012, Texas Tech introduced the creation of a ring of Honor to honor former Tech players. The names are etched onto the west stadium building that faces the surface of the stadium, screen by a selection committee that makes formal recommendation to the athletic director of suitable candidates. Seven members are listed, three of whom already had their numbers retired.
Individual honors.
Many of Texas Tech's players have been recognized for their accomplishments while with the program. Seven Red Raider players, Donny Anderson, Hub Bechtol, Byron Hanspard, E. J. Holub, Dave Parks, Gabriel Rivera, and Zach Thomas, have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Anderson, Holub, and Parks are the only three players at Texas Tech to have had their numbers retired.
Two Red Raiders, Anderson in 1965 and Graham Harrell in 2008, have been named "Sporting News" College Football Player of the Year, which is bestowed upon the most outstanding college football player of that season by "Sporting News". While no Texas Tech player has ever received the Heisman Trophy, seven Red Raiders have received votes by the award's selection committee. Donny Anderson and Graham Harrell both finished fourth in the voting in 1965 and 2008, respectively, the highest ranking a Red Raider has received from voters. Additionally, Michael Crabtree, Byron Hanspard, E. J. Holub, Kliff Kingsbury, and B. J. Symons were Heisman candidates, receiving enough votes to finish in the top 10.
Texas Tech football players have won several individual awards based on their positions. At the end of the 1993 season, Bam Morris received the Doak Walker Award, and in 1996, Byron Hanspard became the second Red Raider to receive the award. Michael Crabtree became the first two-time winner of both the Fred Biletnikoff Award and Paul Warfield Trophy in back-to-back seasons. Four Texas Tech quarterbacks, Kliff Kingsbury, B.J. Symons, Graham Harrell, and Patrick Mahomes have been awarded the Sammy Baugh Trophy. Harrell received the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award. In 2003, Wes Welker won the Mosi Tatupu Award, given annually to the best special teams player.
In 1935, Herschel Ramsey was the first football player from Texas Tech to be named an All-American. Since then, a total of 49 players have been named to an All-American team, 30 were selected as first-team All-Americans. Twelve Red Raiders have been named consensus All-Americans, players who were awarded a majority of votes at their positions by the selectors, with the most recent selection being tight end Jace Amaro in 2013. Michael Crabtree was named as a consensus All-Americans in 2007 and 2008, and is the only Red Raider to receive the honor twice. Ten Red Raiders have been named academic All-Americans.
Venue, atmosphere, and culture.
Stadium.
The Red Raiders play their home games on campus at Jones AT&amp;T Stadium. The stadium opened in 1947 as Clifford B. and Audrey Jones Stadium. In 2000, Jones Stadium was renamed, Jones SBC Stadium, in recognition of a $30 million donation from SBC Communications. Reflecting SBC Communications' rebranding as AT&amp;T, Inc., the stadium's name was renamed in 2005 as Jones AT&amp;T Stadium. Then known as the Matadors, Texas Tech's first home field was a makeshift stadium at the South Plains Fairgrounds in Lubbock, for the 1925 season and first game of the 1926 season. In 1926, Tech Stadium, a wooden horseshoe shaped 12,000 seat stadium, was built on campus. Twenty-years later, Jones Stadium as was completed for the 1947 season. Two years prior to the stadium's opening, Clifford B. Jones, former Texas Tech University president, established a $100,000 trust toward construction for a new football stadium. The Texas Tech Board of Directors voted to name the new facility in honor of the former president and his wife's contribution.
Since opening with a seating capacity of 18,000, the stadium has been continuously expanded and renovated. In 1960, the addition of a lower bowl doubled the seating capacity to 41,500, an expansion in 1972 added over 10,000 seats, during the 1990s, 2,000 seats were added, and additions in the 2000s brought a seating capacity to 60,454. In 2003, a seven-story building including 47 suites, a club seat level and new press box replaced the former press box constructed in 1959. In 2010, expansion to the east side of the stadium included a five-story addition that includes 1,000 general-admission seats, 542 club seats, 30 suites, a dining club, and pro shop. Also, ticket and athletic offices relocated to the East Side Building. In 2013, the stadium was once again renovated with 368 seats being added, an upgraded video board and sound system installed, a colonnade and connecting concourse in the north endzone, and a 40-person observation deck.
When Jones AT&amp;T Stadium opened in 1947, the playing surface was originally natural grass. However, at the beginning of the 1972 season, the stadium's natural grass was replaced with AstroTurf. Jones AT&amp;T Stadium has had a FieldTurf playing surface since 2006. Jones AT&amp;T Stadium set an attendance record of 61,836 spectators November 2, 2013, when the Red Raiders hosted the 2013 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team, and the student attendance record was set during the same season. The student section has been named as the best in the Big 12 by ESPN. The stadium has played host to 14 seasons in which the Red Raiders went undefeated at home. In July 2014, the athletic department announced that all season tickets had sold out for the first time in school history with a record 38,502 tickets sold.
In 2014, Texas Tech announced a substantially sized stadium renovation to Jones AT&amp;T Stadium. The total cost of the renovations totals to roughly around $185 million, and will add new things to the Jones like club seating, more suites, and a hall of fame for the heroes and champions of Texas Tech Football. The south-end zone is also getting a renovation, creating more student-section seating and a press box.
Uniforms.
Texas Tech's football team was originally known as the "Matadors" from 1925 to 1936, a name suggested by the wife of E. Y. Freeland, the first football coach, to reflect the Spanish Renaissance architecture on campus. The students followed the suggestion, and later chose scarlet and black as the school colors inspired by a matador's traditional red cape and black outfit. In 1934, head coach Pete Cawthon ordered scarlet satin uniforms for the football team. He said that if the team did not attract attention by their playing, they would at least be noticed because of the flashy uniforms. The football team, wearing its new outfit, defeated heavily favored Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles on October 26, 1934. A Los Angeles sports writer called the Matadors a "red raiding team", coining the moniker Texas Tech's athletics teams use today.
Texas Tech's uniform consists of any combination of scarlet, black, and white. Since 2006, Under Armour has been the team's outfitter. In 2013, head coach Kliff Kingsbury was given creative control over the team's uniforms and equipment design via a contract clause. Starting in 2024, Adidas has taken over as the uniform partner of the Red Raiders, with certain uniforms featuring the personal logo of former Tech QB Patrick Mahomes II, an Adidas endorsee.
The 2010 team was the first to wear white helmets since 1974. The white helmets were similar in design to the ones worn during the Jim Carlen era from 1970–1974 featuring a one-inch scarlet stripe in the middle bordered by two half inch black stripes. The helmets used in 2010 feature a black face mask instead of scarlet and the current version of the Double T. The helmets were worn for away games against the New Mexico Lobos, Iowa State Cyclones, and Oklahoma Sooners. The 2013 team saw a great expansion of uniform combinations and designs coinciding with Kingsbury's creative control over the uniforms. In 2019, Texas Tech would wear the College Football 150 patch, a patch worn by every FBS program to recognize the invention of college football in 1869, above the Big 12 logo on all their uniforms worn that season.
Goin' Band from Raiderland.
The Goin' Band from Raiderland, originally known as The Matador Band, is as old as Texas Tech itself. The band performed at the team's first game in October 1925, fielding between 21 and 25 members. The following year, the band earned its name when it became the first collegiate band to travel to an away game. American humorist Will Rogers once aided in financing a trip to Fort Worth, Texas, so the band could perform at a game against the TCU Horned Frogs. Today, in keeping with the campus' Spanish Renaissance architecture, the uniforms of the Goin' Band are styled after the "trajes" of matadors, complete with cape and a flat-brimmed "gaucho" hat. The 450-member band, which was awarded the Sudler Trophy – an award only allowed to be awarded once – in 1999, performs at all home football games and at various other events.
Mascots.
The Masked Rider is Texas Tech University's oldest mascot, and was the first official mounted mascot in the country. The tradition began in 1936, when "ghost riders" were dared to circle the field prior to home football games. The Masked Rider became an official mascot in 1954, when Joe Kirk Fulton led the team onto the field at the Gator Bowl. According to reports from those present at the game, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched Fulton and his horse Blackie rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After a few moments, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer for the "Atlanta Journal" who witnessed the event, later wrote, "No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance." In 2000, The Masked Rider tradition was commemorated with the unveiling of a statue outside of the university's Frazier Alumni Pavilion. The sculpture, created by artist Grant Speed, is 25 percent larger than life.
Today the Masked Rider, with guns up, leads the team onto the field for all home games. This mascot, adorned in a distinctive gaucho hat like the ones worn by members of the marching band, is one of the most visible figures at Texas Tech.
Texas Tech's other mascot, Raider Red, is a more recent creation. Beginning with the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor. Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure. The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle Tramps or High Riders.
Rivalries.
Ordered in terms of historical, active rivalries.
Baylor.
The Texas Tech Red Raiders have played more games against the Baylor Bears than any other opponent. The rivalry began in 1929. The game has been played every year since 1956 despite the fact that Texas Tech was a member of the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. In 1960, Texas Tech joined the Southwest Conference, ensuring the rivalry would continue. In 1996, the Southwest Conference dissolved, and both teams were invited, along with the Texas Longhorns and Texas A&amp;M Aggies, with former members of the Big Eight Conference to form the Big 12 Conference. From 1947–64, Baylor won 14 of the 15 games. From 1996–2010, Texas Tech won 15 straight games. Baylor then won 5 straight meetings. Baylor leads the series, 42–40–1.
TCU.
The winner of the annual game is presented with the Saddle Trophy, a traveling icon which bears plaques marking the score of each meeting between the rival schools. The teams have met on the gridiron in 63 games since 1926. The "West Texas Championship - Saddle Trophy" was first awarded, from 1961 through 1970. During this ten-year stretch, the schools split the series 5–5. The trophy was lost and the rivalry name disappeared for decades until the moniker and trophy were reintroduced in 2017. This football game is known as the West Texas Championship - Battle for the Saddle Trophy. Texas Tech leads the series 32–30–3 through the 2022 season.
Houston.
During the history of the Southwest Conference, Texas Tech University was one of Houston's original rivals, playing every year from 1976 to 1995 when both schools were part of the now-defunct Southwest Conference. The two teams have had some very close games over their history that came down to the wire, with 16 out of the first 34 matchups being decided by single digits and a tie game in 1987. On September 4, 2021, the two met again to play the Texas Kickoff game at NRG Stadium. After the game, several fans broke out into a fight in the stands. With the Texas Longhorns leaving the Big XII for the SEC and the Houston Cougars joining the Big XII, Texas Tech and Houston will be the only two Texas public universities in the conference. Texas Tech also played the Houston Cougars in 2022 at Jones AT&amp;T Stadium with the final score being 33–30 in double overtime, led by Donavan Smith who later transferred to Houston.
Dormant Rivalries.
Texas.
Since the 1996 season, the Chancellor's Spurs, a traveling trophy, has been exchanged between the two university system chancellors, in honor of the two universities' rivalry. It is common for Texas Tech students to camp out a few days prior to home football games against the Texas Longhorns and the Oklahoma Sooners. The 2008 game was one of three games that led to a three-way tie controversy in the Big 12 Conference South Division, the first three-way tie in a collegiate conference division. The Texas Longhorns lead the all-time series 54–18 and have won 20 of 26 games since the Chancellor's Spurs were first exchanged. After the 2022 contest where the Texas Longhorns team lost in overtime to the Red Raiders 37–34 in Lubbock, it is unknown if the rivalry will continue with the Longhorns move to the SEC in 2024. The Longhorns will host the Red Raiders for the final time as conference mates in 2023. Texas leads the series 55–18.
Texas A&amp;M.
Texas Tech first played the Aggies in 1927 and the teams played annually from 1957 to 2011. The Texas A&amp;M–Texas Tech football rivalry has experienced multiple altercations off the playing field between coaches, players and fans. Since both teams joined the Big 12 Conference in 1996, Texas Tech has won 10, while Texas A&amp;M has won 6, of these last 16 meetings. Texas A&amp;M has a three-game winning streak against Texas Tech following their 2011 victory against Texas Tech in Lubbock. The rivalry has been dormant since Texas A&amp;M departed the Big 12 for the SEC in 2012. The Texas A&amp;M Aggies lead the all-time series 37–32–1.
Arkansas.
The two schools first met in 1957, with Arkansas defeating Texas Tech by a score of 47–26 in Little Rock, Arkansas. Arkansas won the first nine games in the rivalry before Texas Tech broke through with a 21–16 victory in 1966. The Red Raiders also defeated the Razorbacks the following year, winning 31–27. After a 30–7 Texas Tech victory in 1976, Arkansas embarked on another nine-game winning streak, winning every year until 1986. Arkansas and Texas Tech played every year from 1957–1991, when the teams were members of the Southwest Conference. In 1992, Arkansas joined the Southeastern Conference, and the two schools have only played twice since: a 49–28 Arkansas victory in 2014 and a 35–24 Texas Tech victory in 2015. The teams are scheduled to meet in the 2024 Liberty Bowl, and have a regular season home-and-home series scheduled for 2030 and 2031. Arkansas leads the series 29–8 through the 2022 season.
Future Big 12 opponents.
On November 1, 2023, Texas Tech's Big 12 opponents from 2024 through 2027 were revealed.

Prehistoric Norfolk

The prehistory of the County of Norfolk, England is broken into specific time periods, these being Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic .
Norfolk has a very rich prehistoric past, from the Palaeolithic era 950,000 years ago, to end of the Iron Age 2000 years ago. Indeed, Norfolk has the earliest evidence of human occupation of what is now Britain, and some of the country's best-preserved archaeological sites.
Palaeolithic.
The period from almost three-quarters of a million years ago until around 10,000 years ago.
During the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods the coast of Norfolk would have been 60–70 km further to the north than today, with much of the North Sea a wide, open plain. The size of the habitable land would have varied through the different glacial and interglacial periods up until the end of the Anglian Stage, as would have the climate, flora and fauna, and the general landscape of Norfolk. The Anglian glaciation was the 3rd from last glacial stage and occurred between 400,000 and 500,000 years ago. This stage was the last time the ice sheets reached East Anglia and it resulted in the deposits known as the Corton Formation.
The majority of the evidence for Lower and Middle Palaeolithic occupation in East Anglia survives as redeposited flakes and tools recovered from river gravel deposits. These river gravels were laid by the ancestral Thames and Bytham River systems. Large quantities of artefacts were identified from gravel quarries during the 19th and early 20th century due to the increased demand for gravel in the construction industry and the hand sorting of this gravel.
Lower Palaeolithic.
Bones and flint tools found in coastal deposits near Happisburgh. The artefacts were "in situ" in riverine deposits of the Cromer Forest Bed series. Experts previously thought the earliest humans arrived 700,000 years ago.
The flint assemblage consists of;
The importance of the flint assemblage of Happisburgh is not just to the understanding the prehistory of Norfolk, but to the understanding of prehistoric Europe. This is due to the first mentioned hand axe in the assemblage. The hand axe is an ovate handaxe made from black flint with pale grey coarse-grained inclusions, one face carries two small areas of pebble cortex, and is in near perfect condition. This handaxe is believed to be the earliest tool yet found in Europe; it was probably used as a knife for cutting up carcasses.
The environmental conditions of Happisburgh, shown through pollen analysis, suggests a picture of a temperate woodland with areas of fen carr and aquatic plants growing in a maritime environment of tidal sediments. With evidence showing a preponderance of pine and alder, with oak, elm and hornbeam also present; members of the galingale, buttercup and nettle families point to fen or reedswamp environments, while water-starwort, water lilies and bulrushes are among the aquatic plants present.
Other Lower Palaeolithic sites in Norfolk include:
There is little evidence of human occupation during the subsequent Ipswichian Stage between around 180,000 and 70,000 years ago, lead.
Middle Palaeolithic.
Roughly 60,000 years age to 30,000 years ago.
Well-preserved in-situ Middle Palaeolithic open-air sites are exceedingly rare in Europe and very unusual within a British context.
In-situ mammoth remains and associated Mousterian stone tools and debitage. The artefactual, faunal, and environmental evidence were sealed, in-situ, within a Middle Devensian palaeochannel with a dark organic fill.
Forty-four pristine Mousterian flint handaxes, the remains of at least nine Mammuthus primigenius (woolly mammoths).
 The assemblage.
Some 590 worked flint artefacts consisting of number of handaxes (pointed, subcordiform, cordiform, ovate and bout coupé forms), three cores and a number of retouched, utilised and waste flakes were individually recorded with over 1,000 pieces of microdebitage recovered from the 0.50 m2 spit units. A number of the handaxes and flakes were found in direct association with bones and/or tusks. The artefacts are generally fresh and relatively sharp with minimal abrasion or post-depositional edge damage. Typologically the assemblage falls within the Mousterian of Acheulean Tradition (MTA) facies of the Middle Palaeolithic.
The Fauna, flora and environmental evidence.
In total, some 2,079 bones, tusks, antlers, and teeth of Mammuthus primigenius (mammoth), Coelodonta antiquitatis (woolly rhinoceros), Rangifer tarandus (reindeer), Equus ferus (wild horse), Bison priscus (bison), Canis lupus (wolf), Vulpes vulpes or Alopex lagopus (red or Arctic fox), and Ursus arctos (brown bear) were individually recorded and a further 25,000 bone, tooth, and tusk fragments recovered. Feces of scavengers (possibly the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta) were also recovered from the organic sediments. No articulated skeletons were found. The bone varied in condition with some bones extensively weathered and others exhibiting traces of gnawing by predator-scavengers. Bone fractures characteristic of marrow extraction by hominids have been identified on some of the reindeer and horse bones recovered from the deposit. The faunal remains recovered from the palaeochannel are typical of the Pin Hole Mammal Assemblage Zone of the Middle Devensian.
Through archaeo-environmental analysis, 150 species of insect have been identified. These indicate the presence of standing water, marsh, bare sand and grass. Dung and carcass beetles add to the picture of giant rotting mammals being scavenged by hyenas and Neanderthals. The presence of sub-Arctic plants, insects and snails at this site indicates that the Neanderthals of this time lived in a climate like that of modern Scandinavia.
Interpretation
The mammoths appear to have been butchered but it is unclear whether these beasts were hunted, or their meat simply scavenged from corpses. The site is internationally important due to the rarity of such sites being preserved.
Other sites
There is little evidence from this period. Other sites within modern Norfolk include:
Upper Palaeolithic.
The Upper Palaeolithic period covers the end of the last glaciation Devensian Stage and the immediate post-glacial period Flandrian. At the beginning of this period Britain was a part of the European landmass and settlement in Norfolk was just an extension of the settlement of the North European Plain, while by the end of this period it had become more or less the island that we now know. At the end of the Devensian the sea-level was about 30 m below present with most of the land becoming forested with the ameliorating climate. In the mid-9th millennium BP, with the breaching of the land bridge, East Anglia became cut off from the rest of north-west Europe. Sea levels rose rapidly and peat formation commenced in low-lying areas.
Although material has been recovered from across the region dating to this period, there have been very few large scale excavations, particularly in recent years. The majority of material identified from East Anglia consists of stray artefacts with only a few known stratified sites. Norfolk also lacks the cave sites which have proved to be so important for the preservation of sites in other areas e.g. Kent's Cavern, Torbay, Devon; Creswell Crags, Derbyshire; Gough's Cave, Cheddar Gorge, Somerset. The Earlier Upper Palaeolithic is very poorly represented across the whole region although there is somewhat more known from the Later Upper Palaeolithic.
Early Upper Palaeolithic
Flint leaf points reported at Heacham and Feltwell but it is not certain that they are not products of the later, Neolithic industries which also included leaf points.
List of sites

J J Wymer and P A Robins 1994" A long blade flint industry beneath boreal peat at Titchwell, Norfolk " Norfolk Archaeology, Vol XLII, part 1
In general this period is still poorly understood in Norfolk.
Mesolithic.
The beginning of the Holocene corresponds with the beginning of the Mesolithic age in most of Europe around 10,000 years ago. Temperatures rose, probably to levels similar to those today, and forests expanded further. By 8,500 years ago, the rising sea levels caused by the melting glaciers cut Britain off from continental Europe for the last time. The warmer climate changed the Arctic environment to one of pine, birch and alder forest; this less open landscape was less conducive to the large herds of reindeer and horse that had previously sustained humans. Those animals were replaced in people's diets by less social animals such as elk, red deer and aurochs which would have required different hunting techniques in order to be effectively exploited. Tools changed to incorporate barbs which could snag the flesh of a hunted animal, making it harder for it to escape alive. Tiny microliths were developed for hafting onto harpoons and spears. Woodworking tools such as adzes appear in the archaeological record, although some flint blade types remained similar to their Palaeolithic predecessors. The dog was domesticated because of its benefits during hunting (see Star Carr) and the wetland environments created by the warmer weather would have been a rich source of fish and game. It is likely that these environmental changes were accompanied by social changes with the groups that inhabited Britain at this time. Evidence from other parts of Britain suggests that during this period the people were becoming more settled rather than solely nomadic see Howich on the Northumbrian coast, Dunbar in East Lothian, although there is no evidence found in Norfolk to date.
Sites
Due to the coast being much further out than the present coast line and the barbed antler point found in the North Sea suggests there are many more Early Mesolithic sites under the North Sea off the Norfolk coast.
Other inland sites
The Breckland district seems to have been attractive to hunter-gatherers during the Late Mesolithic (c. 6000–4000 BC). This may be due to its proximity to the fen-edge and salt marshes, which were rich in wildfowl, and eels. The lighter soils of Breckland, lighter than on the claylands to the north, would have resulted in the wildwoods being less dense thus enabling easier hunting of deer and other species. Two recent excavations in different parts of Thetford are:
Microliths have frequently been found in the Brecks, including along the Little Ouse Valley, and around the edges of the meres (small lakes).
The heavier boulder clay of the Norfolk till plain has a site that has produced more flint tranchet axes than any other in East Anglia

Neolithic.
The Neolithic period, 4000-2500BC, has produced a larger archaeological record than the previous prehistoric periods due to their impact and changing their surroundings that the Neolithic peoples had on the landscape, from industrial to maybe religious needs. By the time of the Neolithic Norfolk, like the rest of Britain, was cut off from mainland Europe by the North Sea and the English Channel.
Norfolk has revealed important information concerning this period in British history.
Neolithic communities seem to have preferred Norfolk's light soils and well-drained river valley tracts, rather than the heavily wooded central claylands, although these were probably occupied to some extent and also exploited for hunting and foraging. Excavation results indicate that the woodland was dominated by oak and pine, see Broome Heath and Colney. The fertile Rich Loam region of north and east Norfolk, with its loess-rich soils, may have been especially congenial, and the number of possible monuments here is striking.

Causewayed enclosures
All of the Norfolk Causewayed enclosure sites appear to be approximately circular, defined by relatively narrow ditches and pit sections, interspersed with narrow causeways. These enclosures are generally defined by single ditches, however the recently published plot of Roughton (Oswald et al., 2001: fig. 6.7), has identified a second, more ephemeral, inner ditch or feature. The three possible Norfolk examples are relatively small and have a marked circularity in comparison to many other causewayed enclosure sites in England
The way in which they were used is not fully understood, but they may have been a meeting point for small, dispersed groups of people living in the surrounding area, a place where the exchange of goods, ritual feasting and other ceremonial activities might have taken place.
All three enclosures, the only sites of this type known from the county, are notable for their small size and circular shape. In national terms their morphology is rather anomalous, a characteristic which can be interpreted in a number of ways. It has been suggested that they may have more in common with hengiform monuments of the later Neolithic and early Bronze Age than with 'normal' causewayed enclosures of the fourth millennium BC. Alternatively, they might represent a regional tradition distinct to this part of the country. In addition, the geographical distribution of the sites is confined to north-east Norfolk. While some allowance can be made for the usual factors associated with the distribution of cropmark sites (soils, geology, etc.), at present it seems that the clustering of the three sites in the north-east of the county may be of archaeological significance. The smaller dimensions of the Norfolk sites may be a reflection of the size and dispersal of the communities creating, maintaining and using them and it may not be necessary to assume that they occurred later than elsewhere in Britain. Although at present no excavation has taken place on any of the Norfolk 'causewayed' enclosures so these questions have yet to be answered.

Long Barrows
In Norfolk there is only rare evidence of the remains of Long Borrows, most of the remains having been ploughed flat over the years.
The barrow, as well as being used for burial, may also have had ceremonial uses.

Beth's Cafe

Beth's Cafe is a restaurant in Seattle, Washington, United States. Located on Aurora Avenue North in the Green Lake neighborhood, it is known largely for its "greasy spoon" cuisine and large portions. Beth's opened in 1954 and has remained at the same location since, under various owners. It closed in 2021 but reopened in 2023.
Formerly a 24-hour establishment, Beth's Cafe was popular among young Seattle residents during late-night hours. The walls are covered in artwork produced by patrons, along with quotes such as "I lost my virginity at Beth's" and "Pre-Game for Beth's" accompanied by a depiction of a young man smoking out of a bong. The restaurant and its "Southwestern Exposure" 12-egg omelette challenge were featured in a 2009 episode of "Man v. Food". The cafe had also been noted in Seattle guidebooks by Lonely Planet and Moon Publications among others.
History.
In 1954, Beth's Cafe was opened by Beth and Harold Eisenstadt. It started out as a nickel slot gambling parlor but transformed into a restaurant to keep customers around.
On June 1, 1998, the cafe had to be temporarily shut down after some cardboard in a dumpster behind the restaurant unexpectedly caught fire and caused substantial structural damage.
In 2002, Chris Dalton answered a classified ad selling Beth's and became the latest owner of the breakfast eatery. After Dalton's purchase, Beth's started to add home-baked goods, many previously frozen and canned ingredients were switched over to fresh ingredients (such as meats, chili, corned beef hash, etc.), and vegetarian options became available. Beth's is famous for its wide array of breakfast food, accounting for 80 percent of its business. Beth's runs through more than 450,000 eggs per year. In 2014, Beth's celebrated its sixtieth anniversary with weekly specials that included 1950s pricing and hosted a 1950s-themed party.
Beth's was put up for sale in 2019 so that Dalton could focus on treatment for stage four pancreatic cancer, but no buyer was found. Dalton died in April 2020. Beth's closed in October 2020 due to occupancy restrictions enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The restaurant briefly re-opened on July 8, 2021, under the management of Hazel Dalton, closing again two months later. It re-opened on February 1, 2023, with limited hours, closing at 3 or 5 p.m.
12 egg omelette.
Beth's Cafe is well known for its 12-egg omelette; the restaurant and this menu item are listed in "1,000 Places to See in the USA and Canada Before You Die" and other books. There are six varieties of their omelettes, with the "Triple Bypass", a mixture of bacon, sausage, ham, and two types of cheese, being the most popular. The 12-egg omelettes are served on a pizza tray with all-you-can-eat hash browns and toast and are intended for sharing. Prizes are not awarded for finishing the 12-egg omelette.
In a 2009 episode of "Man v. Food", host Adam Richman took part in the 12-egg omelette challenge. Richman and a previous omelette challenge winner competed to finish a Southwestern Exposure 12-egg omelette (filled with cheddar, sour cream, salsa, and brisket chili). Richman and his competitor could not finish the omelette. After the "Man vs. Food" episode aired there was a significant rise in business that sometimes resulted in an hour and a half wait times for patrons.

Groveland, California

Groveland is a census-designated place (CDP) in Tuolumne County, California. The 2020 United States census reported Groveland's population was 540.
Groveland was created as a CDP prior to the 2010 census; previously it was part of Groveland-Big Oak Flat CDP.
History.
Groveland has always been an important stop on the highway to Yosemite but really grew in the early 1900s with the development of the Tuolumne River Hetch-Hetchy water project for the city of San Francisco. Groveland is adjacent to the Stanislaus National Forest and is known for the historic Iron Door Saloon.
Groveland was originally a gold rush town and then became a sleepy farming community until the San Francisco Hetch Hetchy water project made it their headquarters and built a railroad yard and hospital for the work crews (both now gone). From 1915 till 1935, Groveland was a boom town supporting seven hotels, 10,000 residents and much activity. When the work crews left, the town again became a minor stop on the way to Yosemite until the Boise Cascade company built the Pine Mountain Lake community with a first class golf course, an airport and lake and staked out 5,000 lots. This development has since grown from a summer home area to a retirement community to a thriving neighborhood with year-round families, boosting the once sleepy Groveland to a travel and vacation destination in its own right.
Geography.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 9.6 square miles (24.8 km2), 99.94% of it land and 0.06% of it water.
Climate.
This region experiences warm to very hot and dry summers, with the hottest month having an average temperature of 73.7 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Groveland has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated "Csa."
Demographics.
The 2020 United States census reported that Groveland had a population of 540. The population density was . The racial makeup of Groveland was 458 (84.8%) White, 1 (0.2%) African American, 9 (1.7%) Native American, 3 (0.6%) Asian, 0 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 11 (2.0%) from other races, and 58 (10.7%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 44 persons (8.1%).
The whole population lived in households. There were 245 households, out of which 44 (18.0%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 87 (35.5%) were married-couple households, 25 (10.2%) were cohabiting couple households, 68 (27.8%) had a female householder with no partner present, and 65 (26.5%) had a male householder with no partner present. 90 households (36.7%) were one person, and 46 (18.8%) were one person aged 65 or older. The average household size was 2.2. There were 136 families (55.5% of all households).
The age distribution was 96 people (17.8%) under the age of 18, 36 people (6.7%) aged 18 to 24, 125 people (23.1%) aged 25 to 44, 133 people (24.6%) aged 45 to 64, and 150 people (27.8%) who were 65years of age or older. The median age was 46.8years. For every 100 females, there were 122.2 males.
There were 321 housing units at an average density of , of which 245 (76.3%) were occupied. Of these, 178 (72.7%) were owner-occupied, and 67 (27.3%) were occupied by renters.
Features.
Camp Mather of the City of San Francisco, San Jose Family Camp of the City of San Jose, Berkeley Tuolumne Family Camp of the City of Berkeley, and Camp Tawonga, a Jewish summer camp, are all located east of Groveland off Hwy 120 within the Stanislaus National Forest.

The White Negro

The White Negro: Superficial Reflections on the Hipster is a 9,000-word essay by Norman Mailer that connects the "psychic havoc" wrought by the Holocaust and atomic bomb to the aftermath of slavery in America in the figuration of the Hipster, or the "white negro".
The essay is a call to abandon Eisenhower liberalism and a numbing culture of conformity and psychoanalysis in favor of the rebelliousness, personal violence and emancipating sexuality that Mailer associates with marginalized black culture. "The White Negro" was first published in the 1957 special issue of "Dissent", before being published separately by City Lights. Mailer's essay was controversial upon its release and received a mixed reception, winning praise, for example, from Eldridge Cleaver and criticism from James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, and Allen Ginsberg. Baldwin, in particular, heavily criticized the work, asserting that it perpetuated the notorious "myth of the sexuality of Negros" and stating that it was beneath Mailer's talents. The work remains his most famous and most reprinted essay and it established Mailer's reputation as a "philosopher of hip".
Background.
The origins of "The White Negro" ("WN") date from the mid-1950s. According to the biography of Carl Rollyson, Mailer wanted to tap into the energy of the Beat Generation and the changes of consciousness members such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac inspired. Mailer used "Quickly: A Column for Slow Readers", his column in "The Village Voice", to develop and explore his philosophy of "Hip", or "American existentialism". In the psychopathic character of Marion Faye from his 1955 novel "The Deer Park", Mailer considered he had created a prototypical Hipster. Mailer also tapped into the contemporary cultural dialogue about black male sexuality and, with the prompting of Lyle Stuart, published four paragraphs about black male super-sexuality in the "Independent". Mailer's outrageous sentiment was not well received (notable critics included William Faulkner, Eleanor Roosevelt, and W. E. B. Du Bois) but the debate prompted him to begin work on "WN".
"Lipton's Journal", Mailer's unpublished 105,000-word diary of self-analysis (written over four months while experimenting with marijuana), also contributed to the essay's genesis. The journal documents "his insights [that] challenge some of the dominant ideas of Western thought", specifically the dualisms that Mailer saw within every individual, like that of the saint and the psychopath. Mailer had planned to use the insights from "Lipton's Journal" in a series of novels which he ultimately never wrote, but he did incorporate some ideas from the journal into "WN". Mailer summarizes these ideas in one of the journal's last entries:
Other influences on both "Lipton's Journal" and "The White Negro" include the psycho-sexual theories of Sigmund Freud and Wilhelm Reich, the writings of Karl Marx, and the music of Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie and other bebop jazz artists. Dearborn writes that Mailer saw these great men of jazz as quintessential figures of Hip: Miles Davis, for example, "was the avatar of Hip, and, with his lean, chiseled good looks and his ultra cool manner he was distinctly a sex symbol as well, appealing to white women as well as black". These elements provided the background for Mailer's new-found understanding of social reality.
Synopsis.
"The White Negro" is a 9,000-word essay divided into six sections of varying lengths.
In Section 1, Mailer argues that the twin horrors of the atom bomb and the concentration camps have wrought "psychic havoc" by subjecting individual human lives to the calculus of the state machine. The collective practices of Western progress seem to render life and death meaningless for the individual who is compelled to join the numbed masses in a "collective failure of nerve". Courage only seems to be present in marginalized, isolated people who can stand in opposition to these practices.
Section 2 proposes that the marginalized figure — "the American existentialist" — lives with the knowledge of quick death, the possibility of state violence, the compulsory need to conform, and the sublimation of baser desires. He knows that the only answer is to accept these conditions, divorce himself from the bored sickness of society, and seek the "rebellious imperatives of the self". Mailer presents a dichotomy: one path leads to a quiet prison of the mind and body, that is, to boredom, sickness, and desperation, while the other leads to "new kinds of victories [that] increase one's power for new kinds of perception". Either one is a rebel — the Hip, the psychopath — or, tempted by the promise of success, one conforms to "the totalitarian tissues of an American society", and becomes Square. Because he has lived on the margins of society, for Mailer the American Negro is the model for the Hipster: someone living for the primitive present and the pleasures of the body. Mailer links this proposition with jazz and its appeal to the sensual, the improvisational, and the immediate, in other words, to what Mailer calls the "burning consciousness of the present" felt by the existentialist, the bullfighter, and the Hipster alike. In summary, one can "remain in life only by engaging death".
Section 3 defines the Hipster further as a "philosophical psychopath" interested in codifying, like Hemingway, the "dangerous imperatives" that define his experience. He is a contradiction, possessing a "narcissistic detachment" from his own "unreasoning drive" allowing him to shift his attention from immediate gratification to "future power". Psychopaths, Mailer continues, "are trying to create a new nervous system for themselves" one that distinguishes itself from the "inefficient and often antiquated nervous circuits of the past". Yet the stable middle-class values necessary to achieve this via sublimation "have been virtually destroyed in our time". Psychoanalysis cannot provide the answer sought by the overstretched nervous system. It is a practice which only succeeds in "tranquilizing" a patient's most interesting qualities: "The patient is indeed not so much altered as worn out—less bad, less good, less bright, less willful, less destructive, less creative". The nervous system is remade, Mailer contends, by trying to "live the infantile fantasy", in which the psychopath traces the source of his creation in an atavistic quest to give voice and action to infantile, or forbidden, desires. In this "morality of the bottom", then, the psychopath finds the courage to act free of the "old crippling habit" that has anesthetized him. Now, he can purge his violence, even through murder, but what he really seeks is physical love as a "sexual outlaw" in the form of an orgasm more "apocalyptic than the one which preceded it".
Section 3 ends with an introduction to the language of Hip, a "special language" that "cannot be taught" because it is based on a shared experience of "elation and exhaustion" and the dynamic movements of man as a "vector in a network of forces" rather than "as a static character in a crystalized field". 
Section 4 develops this language further, linking the language to movement and the search for the "unachievable whisper of mystery within the sex, the paradise of limitless energy and perception just beyond the next wave of the next orgasm."
Section 5 posits that the Hip judgement of character is "perpetually ambivalent and dynamic". Mailer suggests, developing the existential reality of the Hipster further, that men are character as well as context, giving way to "an absolute relativity where there are no truths other than the isolated truths of what each observer feels at each instant of his existence". The consequence of this realization is liberation from the "Super-Ego of society". The moral imperative, then, centers in the individual who acts in accordance with his desires, not as the group would have him behave: "The nihilism of Hip proposes as its final tendency that every social restraint and category be removed, and the affirmation implicit in the proposal is that man would then prove to be more creative than murderous and so would not destroy himself". The idea is that even individual acts of violence — because they come from courage to act — prove more desirable than any collective state violence, as the former would be more genuine, creative, and cathartic. A "psychically armed rebellion", Mailer continues, is necessary to free everyone: "A time of violence, new hysteria, confusion and rebellion will then be likely to replace the time of conformity". This potentially violent rebellion would be preferable to the "murderous liquidations of the totalitarian state".
Finally, in Section 6, Mailer speculates whether "the last war of them all" will be between factions of socially polar communities or through despair at the current crisis of capitalism. Perhaps, Mailer ends, we still have something to learn from Marx.
Analysis.
True to his thesis in "First Advertisement for Myself" (from his 1959 collection of essays), Mailer can be seen to be attempting "a revolution in the consciousness of our time" by challenging the thoughts and practices that sanitized American life after World War II. In his biography on Mailer, J. Michael Lennon suggests that "The White Negro" was Mailer's attempt to "will into being an army of hipster revolutionaries who could bring about an urban utopia". In a response to Jean Malaquais, who had criticized "WN" in the magazine "Dissent", Mailer wrote: "the removal therefore of all social restraints while it would open us to an era of incomparable individual violence would still spare us the collective violence of rational totalitarian liquidations . . . and would — and here is the difference — by expending the violence directly, open the possibility of working with that human creativity which is violence's opposite". While "WN" embraces violence, it makes a distinction between violence by the state and individual violence: the former leads to concentration camps and pogroms, while the latter can lead to freedom. For Mailer, writes Maggie McKinley, violence seems to be an essential part of the masculinity of the Hipster, helping to oppose collectivizing and numbing social forces. In a 1957 letter to a publicly critical Malaquais, Mailer clarified his beliefs that: (1) barbarism could be an alternative to totalitarianism, and (2) that human energy should not be sublimated at the expense of the individual.
Both Jean Malaquais and Ned Polsky accused Mailer of romanticizing violence, and Laura Adams highlighted the consequences of Mailer's testing his "violence as catharsis" theory in real life when he nearly killed his second wife Adele by stabbing her twice with a penknife. Polsky stated that Mailer was well aware of the drawbacks in the life of a hipster, but because of his fascination with them, Mailer romanticized away the consequences. For Polsky the hipster wasn't as sexually liberated as Mailer tried to make him seem: "Mailer confuses the life of action with the life of acting out". Because the hipster is crippled psychologically, he is also crippled sexually. Polsky dismissed Mailer's hipster and upheld psychoanalysis as a greater benefit to sexual health.
Although "The White Negro" takes as its subject a subcultural phenomenon, it represents a localized synthesis of Marx and Freud, and thus presages the New Left movement and the birth of the counterculture in the United States. Rollyson suggests that Mailer dismissed a Freudian approach to psychology that called for the adjustment of the individual to societal norms and instead espoused Wilhelm Reich's emphasis on sexual energy and orgasm. Christopher Brookeman created a possible motivation for Mailer through his idea of Marxism combined with a kind of "Reichian Freudianism" to find solutions "in the better orgasm" which in turn would allow for the rise of one's "full instinctual potential". Reich inspired Mailer as one of the few intellectuals or writers in general who had deeply explored the power, primacy and potential of the male orgasm. "The White Negro" is explicitly influenced by Reich in two primary ways: the exaltation of male sexual eruption and the related theme of the virile, iconoclastic male hipster casting off societal rules and impositions to be led instead by his sex, his body and his instincts. These provide a balm and shield against all physical and mental ailments and diseases, including cancer. Mailer makes a comparison of the hipster hero with other outliers in society such as the Negro, the lover and the psychopath. He commends the social outliers' ability to live in a "burning" present, one with a continuous awareness of their closeness to death. Likewise, Mailer's admiration for Linder's description of the psychopath in "Rebel without a Cause: The Hypnoanalysis of the Criminal Psychopath" influenced his formulation of the drama of psychopath as being "one that, in the end, centers on his quest for love". This quest for love — or "the search for an orgasm more apocalyptic than the one which preceded it" — allows the psychopath to become "an embodiment of the extreme contradictions of society which formed his character".
Mailer presents a theme of dualistic "opposed extremes" in his characterization of the hipster and the square. Tony Tanner believes that Mailer was excited by the twentieth century's "tendency to reduce all of life to its ultimate alternatives", noting the value that Mailer places on opposite couplings. "The White Negro" demonstrates Mailer's fondness for duality when he ponders if "the last war of them all will be between the blacks and the whites, or between the women and the men, or between the beautiful and the ugly", again listing some of his favorite alternatives. Similarly, Ihab Hassan shows this duality by using the hipster's face as that of an "alienated" hero covered by a twisted mask in order to hide the look of disgust towards one's own experiences and encounters while out in "search of kicks".
Tracy Dahlby argues that Mailer's hipster is still a necessity in the fight against conformity by consumption. According to Mailer, this fight against conformity will liberate the "squares". Focusing on a post-9/11 world similar to the years after World War II, Dahlby points to the new age of technology, social media, and increased consumption as symptomatic of a mindless society. In a world that exposes people to unspeakable violence and fear through social media, desensitized news coverage, and radical conspiracy theories, the paucity of existential hipsters puts people at risk of failing to achieve a fulfilling life.
Publication.
Though the bulk of the content of "The White Negro" had appeared in piecemeal fashion in Mailer's regular columns in the "Village Voice," the essay in its entirety first appeared in a special issue of "Dissent" in 1957.
It triggered a "great orgasm debate" in subsequent issues, touching on the zeitgeist of the fifties and the effects of psychoanalysis in general. Sorin observes that the board of "Dissent" published the essay apparently without debate, temporarily tripling the periodical's subscriptions. It was only later, relates then-editor Irving Howe, that they realized publishing the essay as-written was "unprincipled".
Despite the initial controversy, Lennon notes, "WN" became the most reprinted essay of an era. It was reprinted with rebuttals from Ned Polsky and Jean Malaquais, followed by Mailer's response, as "Reflections on Hip", in his 1959 miscellany, "Advertisements for Myself". The essay and "Reflections on Hip" were reprinted the same year in pamphlet form by City Light Press, and again by this press several times over the next 15 years. Most recently it appears in "Mind of an Outlaw" (2014). Young enthusiasts of Mailer's essay, states Lennon, carried their copies of the City Light's reprint proudly as a "trumpet of defiance" throughout an awakening nation.
Reception.
Reception to "The White Negro" was mixed, and the essay has been controversial since its publication. It has, according to J. Michael Lennon, been "the most discussed American essay in the quarter century after World War II". According to Tracy Dahlby, Mailer's views were a hot topic in 1957 and many of his critics accused him of accepting violence as a "form of existential expression".
In a letter to Albert Murray, Ralph Ellison called the essay "the same old primitivism crap in a new package". Similarly, Allen Ginsberg termed the essay "very square" and recalled that Jack Kerouac thought Mailer an "intellectual fool". Both considered "The White Negro" a "macho folly" that could not be reconciled with the "tenderheartedness" of the Beat perspective. Ginsberg saw no Dostoyevskian hero in Mailer's violent Hipster.
Several prominent critics, such as James Baldwin, chided Mailer publicly for their perception that, with "The White Negro", he was openly aping lesser writers such as Jack Kerouac in order to jump on the bandwagon of moody, meandering, faux-thrill-seeking Beatniks. Baldwin, in his essay "The Black Boy Looks at the White Boy" for "Esquire" (May 1961) called "The White Negro" "impenetrable", and wondered how Mailer, a writer that he saw as brilliant and talented, could write an essay that was so beneath him. For Baldwin, Mailer's essay simply perpetuated the "myth of the sexuality of Negros" while attempting to sell white people their own innocence and purity. Baldwin showed great respect for Mailer's talent, but aligned "The White Negro" with other distractions—like —that Baldwin saw as beneath Mailer and distracted him from his real responsibility as a writer. 
Kate Millett's view of "The White Negro" criticized Mailer of making a virtue of violence. In her book "Sexual Politics", she makes the claim that Mailer finds that violence is something that he has fallen in love with as a personal and sexual style. She states that for Mailer, "a rapist is only rapist to a square" and that "rape is a part of life". Millett goes on to criticize Mailer of matching the aesthetic of Hip to harmful masculine pride. Additionally, Millett accuses "WN" of celebrating and romanticizing stereotypes about Black hyper-sexuality.
Similarly, author and intellectual Lorraine Hansberry joined Baldwin in rejecting the same message. She argued "WN" also excuses and idealizes society's denigrating and ostracizing Black people to further Mailer's agenda of repackaging White racism as Black iconoclasm. While Mailer seemed to have a sense of the historical importance of the late 1950s, explains Ginsberg, he was being an "apocalyptic goof" with his naive Hipster figuration that Kerouac saw as "well intentioned but poisonous, in the sense that it encouraged an image of violence".

<doc id="7008912" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7008912" title="Skye Terrier">
Skye Terrier

The Skye Terrier is a Scottish dog breed that is a long, low, hardy terrier with short legs. It is "one of the most endangered native dog breeds in the United Kingdom" according to the Kennel Club.
Appearance.
Coat.
The Skye is double coated with a short, soft undercoat and a hard, straight topcoat. The shorter hair of the head veils the forehead and eyes, forming a moderate beard. The ears are generally well feathered and, in prick-eared examples, the hair normally falls like a fringe, accenting the form, and blending with the side locks.
Colour.
Fawn, dark or light silver-grey, and cream are the standard colours. Regardless of colour all Skye terriers should have black points on their ears. muzzle and nose. There is generally no further patterning on the body, but a small white spot on the chest is relatively common.
Types.
Except for the shape and size of the ears, there is no significant difference nor preference given between the prick- and drop-eared types. When prick, they are medium-sized, carried high on the skull and angled slightly outwards.
Health.
In 1998, 'Skye terrier hepatitis' was described from biopsies of the livers of nine related Skye Terriers. This condition is not known in any other breed and the aetiology is unknown. It causes severe liver disease with scar tissue formation that may progress to cirrhosis. Researchers with the Cambridge University Department of Veterinary Medicine found that the condition is not actually a form of hepatitis. Prognosis varies between dogs and no gene has been identified as causing the condition nor has any heritability been properly demonstrated.
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.4 years from a sample of 39 deaths for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.
History.
These dogs were found on the Isle of Skye, and the dogs were then named Skye Terriers. Some confusion exists in tracing its history because, for a certain time, several different breeds had the same name "Skye Terrier" and sometimes "Scotch Terrier". The loyal dog, said to have been present under the petticoat of Mary, Queen of Scots at her execution, has been ascribed as a Skye Terrier. In 1840, Queen Victoria made the breed fancy, keeping both drop-(floppy) and prick-(upwards) eared dogs. A colour lithograph of Skye Terriers was included in "The Illustrated Book of the Dog" by Vero Shaw in 1881.
This increased its popularity and the Skye Terrier came to America due to this. The AKC recognized the breed in 1887, and it quickly appeared on the show scene. Its popularity has significantly dropped and now it is one of the least known terriers. There is little awareness of its former popularity.
Under threat.
There are concerns that the breed is under threat of extinction with only 30 born in the UK in 2005. It is today one of the most endangered of the Vulnerable Native Breeds of that country. The breed may disappear completely within 40 years.

Timbergrove Manor, Houston

Timbergrove Manor is a neighborhood in northwest Houston, Texas. It consists of two sections with two different homeowners associations: Timbergrove Manor Civic Club (TMCC) and Timbergrove Manor Neighborhood Association (TMNA).
Timbergrove Manor derives its name from the pine trees in the community. there are about 1,200 houses there.
History.
German American farmers settled the area in the 1800s.
Timbergrove Manor itself was developed beginning in 1950. Chris Lane of the "Houston Press" interviewed a friend who lived in the area in the 1970s as a child, and the friend stated that he recalled the Timbergrove Manor area "felt safe and seemed like a good neighborhood". Lane contrasted it to the poor reputation of the Houston Heights at the time. After residences in the Houston Heights became more expensive, people wishing to be near the Houston Heights bought houses in Timbergrove Manor. In 2000 Katherine Feser of the "Houston Chronicle" reported that house prices were rising in Timbergrove Manor. In 2001 it flooded during Tropical Storm Allison.
In 2014 Lane reported that homebuyers wanting to be close to the center of the city continued to buy in the area, and that there were fewer demolitions of older houses compared to Oak Forest.
Composition.
The TMCC serves sections 5-14.
The development has ranch-style houses. Lane wrote that lot sizes in Timbergrove Manor were relatively large for houses within the 610 Loop, and since Timbergrove Manor was developed after World War II, its houses appear "much more planned" and "more uniform" compared to ones in the Houston Heights.
Education.
Both homeowners associations in Timbergrove Manor are in the Houston Independent School District (HISD).
The TMCC section is assigned to: Sinclair Elementary School, Frank M. Black Middle School, and Waltrip High School. The TMNA section is assigned to: Love Elementary School, Hamilton Middle School, and Waltrip High.
In the late 1970s HISD had plans to move the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (HSPVA) to a lot in Timbergrove Manor. Parents rallied against the move due to its lack of proximity to Downtown Houston, artist landmarks, and the Houston Museum District, even though the district had already paid $500,000 for planning as of 1979. Instead, it moved to Montrose. The district again considered using the Timbergrove site circa 1998, when the Montrose site became extremely overcrowded and parents requested a new campus, but against parents disapproved the Timbergrove site due to the lack of proximity.
Parks and recreation.
Jaycee Park is in TMCC. It underwent a $1 million renovation beginning in 2009; the plans called for adding new athletic facilities and playgrounds, tree planting, and renovating existing ballfields. A former pavilion was demolished as part of the renovations. The Houston Parks and Recreation Department, Houston Parks Board, and Friends of Jaycee Park developed the renovation plan, and the third organization engaged in fundraising campaigns to pay for the park. According to the renovation plans, the park would have a trail, a play area, a baseball field, a basketball court, tennis courts, and a sand volleyball court. It would also have an open area for play and dedicated children's playgrounds. By 2012 the Kinder Foundation paid $100,000 for installing the jogging trail and exercise equipment on the trail site.
West 11th Street Park, in TMCC, is a City of Houston park property; the community already used it as a park by the 1950s. The Timbergrove Sports Association uses the baseball diamond there. The Hogg Foundation, the original owners, gave it to the University of Texas (UT). In the 1950s HISD acquired the property from UT. HISD never developed a school there, and instead sold it to the City of Houston for $9.2 million in 2005 after declaring it "surplus property" the previous year. Under state law HISD had to sell the property once it was declared surplus, and HISD gave priority to the municipal government over any potential private buyers. The City of Houston took out a $3.5 million loan to buy the park, and had been given twelve months to pay it off, or else a part of the park would be repossessed. This prompted residents to set up fundraisers to help pay off the loan.
Religion.
In 2008 Reverend Dwayne Johnson, the pastor of the Resurrection Metropolitan Community Church, a church in Timbergrove Manor, stated that there were about 15-20 openly gay Christian clergy members in Houston.
Resurrection Metropolitan's main service group is the LGBT community. In 1980 the pastor was gay, and almost all of the congregation was LGBT. In December 2010 Reverend Harry Knox, a pro-LGBT activist, became the leader of the Resurrection Metropolitan. In 2011 Resurrection Metropolitan had 850 members.

William Le Poer Trench

Colonel The Hon. William Le Poer Trench CVO, JP (17 June 1837 – 16 September 1920) was an Anglo-Irish politician and British army officer.
He was the third son of William Trench, 3rd Earl of Clancarty and Lady Sarah Juliana Butler.
He married Harriet Maria Georgina Martins, daughter of Sir William Martins, on 21 April 1864.
He fought in the Second Opium War between 1857 and 1858, commanding a ladder company at the capture of Guangzhou and Nankow, and was mentioned in despatches. He gained the rank of Colonel in the service of the Royal Engineers.
The 1868 Ordnance Survey 6 inch map of Middlesex (sheet VI) credits him with surveying the county between 1863 and 1866. 
Between 1872 and 1874, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for County Galway, having unseated the elected MP, John Philip Nolan, on petition; the case was one of the most controversial Irish cases of its time and permanently damaged the reputation of the judge, William Keogh.
He held the office of Justice of the Peace for Westminster, London, Buckinghamshire, and Middlesex. He was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1912.

René Giessen

René Giessen (born 24 December 1944, Prague) is a German musician, composer and conductor.
Giessen is widely known for playing the harmonica in various cover-versions of the title melody of famous German Winnetou-movies from the 1960s starring Pierre Brice and Lex Barker. This melody was composed by German composer Martin Böttcher and originally was played by Johnny Müller. At the time the original themes from the Karl May movies were published they held top positions in the German charts and can be considered a landmark in German film music history. The success of these movies originated a whole new genre later known as the "Spaghetti Westerns" where once again the harmonica plays a dominant role (there is even a character by the name of Harmonica in Sergio Leone's movie "Once Upon a Time in the West") in the music of Ennio Morricone, played on the harmonica by Franco De Gemini.

Djedkhonsuefankh

Djedkhonsuefankh was a High Priest of Amun in Thebes believed to have been in office from 1046–1045 BC.
It is often assumed that he was a son of Pinedjem I who succeeded his brother Masaherta during a time of great turmoil in the city of Thebes. Jürgen von Beckerath has even suggested that it is possible that he died a violent death, accounting for his very short reign. Kenneth Kitchen considered this possibility as well, but also stated that "this may be an over-dramatic interpretation of his brief rule".
All we actually know of his existence is the bare mention of his name on the now–lost coffin of his son. There it reads, according to Cecil Torr:
"[...]re, son of the first prophet of Amun, Djed-Khons-ef-ankh, son of the Lord of the Two Lands, Pinedjem, Beloved of Amun, first prophet of Amun", with the name Pinedjem enclosed in a cartouche.
Djedkhonsuefankh is supposed to have been succeeded as High Priest by his brother Menkheperre, which seems to imply that his son "[...]re" either predeceased him, was too young to succeed or was simply passed over for other reasons.
However, Andrzej Niwiński has suggested that Djedkhonsuefankh was not the son of Pinedjem I, but rather of Pinedjem II, and as such the great grandson of Pinedjem I
Niwiński identifies him with the main official mentioned with the burials of Neskhons in year 5 of king Siamun and of Pinedjem II in year 10 of the same king.
He postulates that Psusennes II (in this model his brother), who probably succeeded his father Pinedjem II as High Priest and succeeded in uniting this title with that of king had Djedkhonsuefankh act as his deputy in Thebes. The title of High Priest on his coffin would then be given posthumously by his son "[...]re"
Niwiński also points out that theophoric names as Djedkhonsuefankh mainly appear very late in the 21st Dynasty.
Djedkhonsuefankh's wife is likely to have been Djedmutesankh, a Singer of Amun, who was buried in Tomb MMA60 in Deir el-Bahari.

Time of the Twins

Time of the Twins is a 1986 fantasy novel in the Dragonlance series by American writers Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. It is the beginning of the "Dragonlance Legends" trilogy, a series detailing the journey of fictional twins, the warrior Caramon Majere and the mage Raistlin Majere, along with the cleric Crysania. The book details the start of their adventure.
Plot introduction.
The book opens with a meeting between the devout cleric, Crysania, the historian, Astinus, and the dark mage, Raistlin. Crysania is determined to stop Raistlin from following the path of darkness. At the end of their meeting, he invites her to the Tower of High Sorcery of Palanthas.
Plot summary.
After detailing the meeting between Crysania, Raistlin, and Astinus, the book shifts to the character Riverwind arriving at the Inn of the Last Home in Solace. He meets Tika Waylan there, and later he asks about Caramon. Tika avoids the question, as Caramon has become a fat drunk in the two years the companions had been apart. Soon, Tanis Half-Elven arrives as well, bringing with him Crysania. The pair of them had been followed and chased by dark creatures, who were sent by Raistlin. Later, Tika casts Caramon out of the house to accompany Tas, Crysania, and Bupu (a gully dwarf who fell in love with Raistlin), who are travelling to the Tower of Wayreth. En route, they encounter Lord Soth, a death knight, who would have killed Crysania had not Paladine interceded and brought her soul to dwell with him. The group continues on to the Tower where they find out Raistlin plans to travel back in time and gain power to challenge Takhisis, head god of evil, and take her place. It is decided that the group, minus Tas and Bupu, will go back to stop him. This serves a twofold purpose, as Crysania can find the healing she needs in the past. However, during the spell, Tas interrupts and goes back with them, defying the law that kender, dwarves, and gnomes cannot go back in time for fear of disrupting and changing it.
The group finds themselves in pre-Cataclysm Istar, a holy empire and residence of the Kingpriest, the most powerful cleric in the world. Thanks to Raistlin's intercession, guards discover them and they think that Caramon has attacked Crysania, as he is dressed in rags and she is covered in blood. Crysania is taken to the Temple of Paladine, home of the Kingpriest, and Caramon is taken to the Games of Istar, a colosseum-like arena which pits contestants against each other in mock fights. Raistlin has sent Caramon to the Games so that he can regain his former strength and recover from alcoholism. Unbeknownst to Caramon, Raistlin has in fact bought Caramon for the games. Caramon realizes that it is necessary to kill Fistandantilus to save Raistlin. After getting back into shape and being duped into killing a fellow gladiator, Caramon enacts his plan. Once he is about to kill Fistandantilus, he finds out that Fistandantilus has been replaced by Caramon's brother, Raistlin. Caramon cannot kill him; it is revealed that Raistlin has taken Fistandantilus's lifeforce into himself, fully taking control of his body.
The scene shifts to Crysania, who is talking to Denubis, an old cleric. When Crysania leaves, the ancient elven cleric Loralon contacts Denubis and takes him away, as all true clerics in the world were taken away before the Cataclysm. Crysania then goes to the Kingpriest's chamber and meets Raistlin there. He reveals the Kingpriest for what he is, a mere man. Crysania runs, broken, from the chamber. Later, around Yuletime, she meets again with Raistlin and he warns her of the anger of the gods. Caramon, back at the games, discovers that Raistlin had nothing to do with the death of the man Caramon had killed in the games. Caramon, after meeting with Crysania, tries to deter some friends of his from staying in Istar, but they do not listen. Caramon then goes after the magical device that can return one person (not many people, as Caramon believes) to their proper time, but finds Tas has taken it in the hopes of preventing the Cataclysm. Finding out that Raistlin has arranged for Caramon's friends to fight him in the Arena, Caramon decides that he must kill Raistlin.
Tas, with the magical time travelling device, goes to the chamber where the Kingpriest will make his demand of the gods for great power in order to defeat evil. Crysania also arrives, as she wants to hear his exact words. Crysania is contacted by Loralon, but refuses his offer to go with him. The Kingpriest makes his demand of the gods.
Caramon begins the battle against his friends at the same time Tas activates the device. To Tas's horror, the device falls apart. Caramon then fights his friends, resulting, though not by his choice, in their deaths. Crysania, Tas, and Caramon rush to Raistlin's chambers beneath the Temple, as Istar crumbles around them. Tas is pinned beneath the falling ceiling. Caramon approaches Raistlin, bent on killing him. However, Crysania risks her life to save Raistlin, and she stops Caramon long enough with a prayer so that Raistlin may complete the time-travel spell that will save them from the Cataclysm.
At the end of the novel, the Cataclysm strikes.

Bond, Colorado

Bond is an unincorporated community and U.S. Post Office located along the Colorado River in Eagle County, Colorado, United States. The Bond post office has the ZIP Code 80423. Although Bond has never had a sizable population, the town has significant railroad history, and once was a stop for most of the passenger trains along the Denver and Rio Grande Western's main line.
History.
Railroad.
Bond was originally served by the never finished Denver and Salt Lake Railroad as a midpoint to the railroad's eventual terminus in Craig, Colorado. Bond was the closest point of the rail line to the nearest through line, the Denver and Rio Grande Western's (D&amp;RGW) mainline which reached the Colorado River about downstream from Bond. The D&amp;RGW purchased the rights to connect the two lines, with the intent of having a more direct connection between Denver and Salt Lake City. In 1932, the D&amp;RGW began construction of the Dotsero Cutoff. The southwestern end of the cutoff became known as Dotsero (a portmanteau of "Dot Zero," the zero mileage point.) The northeastern end of the cutoff near Bond became known as Orestod (the inverse spelling of Dotsero.) When Dotsero Cutoff was completed in 1934, the Moffat Route joined the Rio Grande Mainline, and the tracks from Bond to Craig became a spur line. The Bond, Colorado, post office opened on December 4, 1935. Bond remained a stop on the Denver and Rio Grande Western's passenger trains until their last train, the "Rio Grande Zephyr" was discontinued in 1983.
Geography.
Bond is located at coordinates , west of Denver at an elevation of . It is located along the Colorado River, and is at the southern terminus of the Colorado River Headwaters National Scenic Byway.
Climate.
This climate type is dominated by the winter season, a long, bitterly cold period with short, clear days, relatively little precipitation mostly in the form of snow, and low humidity. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Bond has a subarctic climate, abbreviated "Dfc" on climate maps.

Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1853

The Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1853 met from May 4 to August 2 in order to consider changes to the Massachusetts Constitution. This was the third such convention in Massachusetts history, following the original constitutional convention, in 1779–80 and the second, in 1820–21, which resulted in the adoption of the first nine amendments.
The 1853 convention was dominated by the waning Democratic-Free Soil coalition and proposed an entirely new constitution and seven separate provisions, which could be passed with or without the core constitution. The primary point of contention was the reallocation of political representation in the state; the coalition proposed a maintenance of the town representative system, while the Whigs proposed a proportional representation system that would be dominated by the cities. Every proposal was rejected narrowly by popular referendum, although a number of individual ideas arising from the convention were later adopted by individual amendment processes.
Since 1853, Massachusetts has had one subsequent constitutional convention, in 1917–1918.
Background.
Social changes.
Since 1820, the date of the prior constitutional convention, Massachusetts had undergone radical industrialization. The establishment of the first textile mills in the United States at Waltham and Lowell had altered the state's social and political character, creating dense (by the standards of the day) urban centers.
Failed 1851 attempt to call a convention.
Democrat George S. Boutwell was elected Governor of Massachusetts in January 1851 by a coalition of Democratic Party and Free Soil Party voters and legislators. The coalition government marked the apex of a determined drive against the Whig hegemony which had dominated the Second Party System in Massachusetts. A joint committee of the Massachusetts General Court recommended an amendment giving smaller towns a representative advantage over cities, which were typically Whig-dominated, but it failed to reach the required two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. However, the drive for reform persisted, and a Senate bill put the question of a constitutional convention to a popular vote. The bill passed, but on November 10, 1851 the idea of a convention was rejected by a vote of 65,846 against to 60,972 in favor.
Successful 1852 call.
Undeterred, on May 7, 1852, the General Court passed "An Act relating to the calling a Convention of Delegates of the People, for the purpose of revising the Constitution". On November 8 of that year, the following question was answered in the affirmative by the voters:
Is it expedient that delegates should be chosen to meet in convention for the purpose of revising or altering the Constitution of government of this Commonwealth?
Delegates.
Election.
Delegates were elected on March 7, 1853. Each town was entitled to a number of delegates equal to its number of representatives in the state House. Each town was eligible to elect at least one delegate, and all but eight did so. The apportionment favored the towns over cities. The Commonwealth's 139 smallest towns, with an average population of 1,000, elected 139 delegates; the ten largest cities, with an average population of 29,500, elected only 93.
In the delegate elections, the coalition played to its strengths, stumping the interior on a promise that a vote for coalition delegates would ensure increased power in the state legislature.
Composition.
419 delegates were elected in total. Around one third of the delegates were farmers, by far the largest socioeconomic group present. Another third were made up of lawyers, merchants, and traders. The remainder were mostly small businessmen, professionals, and small-town artisans. Only one of ten came from the working class. Over half of the delegates had experience in the legislature. Historian John Mulkern described the convention as Locofocoist, combining a "progressive antimonopoly and populist spirit" with a "retrogressive anti-city bias."
Only one delegate was an Irish Catholic. Every delegate was male.
Notable delegates included:
Convention.
The Constitutional Convention met at noon on Wednesday, May 4, 1853, at the State House in Boston. There is no record of any oath having been used to swear in the members.
Generally, less than the full 419 delegates were in attendance. For instance, on a vote taken July 28, only 165 members—less than half the full body—were present and voting.
After 72 days of work, it adjourned "sine die" on Tuesday, August 2, 1853, at 1:54 am. The convention submitted eight proposals to popular vote. The Committee on the Pay Roll reported an expense figure of $114,092 for the convention.
Organization.
On the first day of the convention, Democrat Nathaniel P. Banks was elected president over Whig George N. Briggs, 250–137, with four others winning one vote each.
Also on the convention's opening day, one man from each county was selected in order to sit on a committee to establish how best to proceed. They reported back two days later with a recommendation of standing committees. These were as follows:
Fifteen ministers were in attendance; on the second day of the convention, Rev. Warren Burton was elected chaplain from among these. Of 385 votes cast, he received 224, with Lyman Beecher garnering 129, James D. Farnsworth 17, and the rest one or two votes apiece.
Additionally, during the course of its business, the convention found it expedient to organize Committees on Vacancies; the Adoption of the Principle of Plurality in Elections; the Loan and Credit of the State; Banking Corporations; General Corporations; and on the Order of Business. Finally, although the legislature had abandoned this device some years previous, the convention met several times as a "committee of the whole"; this allowed it to circumvent some of the cumbersome rules of procedure normally used and to quickly gauge the support of a particular measure. As for petitions, they "could be presented to the Convention only on introduction by a delegate."
Debates.
The debates notably saw the Whigs adopt a strategy of constitutional reform, a reversal from their historical record of conservative retrenchment. Free Soiler Francis W. Bird remarked, "I thought I came here as one of the progressive in company with a majority of this Convention, but I find that we have all turned to the 'right-about-face.' The conservatives are on the engine, and the radicals are on the brake."
Labor.
The convention was essentially silent on labor, despite growing concerns by and about the new urban industrial population. Despite their salience in recent elections, hours, wages, working conditions, arbitrary contracts, and exploitation of children and women were unaddressed. None of the delegates acknowledged industrial workers, the largest socioeconomic group in the state, as a novel or separate interest group from the general working classes. The coalition push for a secret ballot, which would circumvent the political domination of workers by their managers, was the lone substantive labor issue mentioned.
Elections.
Historically, Whigs had promoted the electoral majority rule system. No candidates for legislative office could win without a majority of the vote; if none received one, run-offs were held until one candidate did. This tended to favor wealthy interests, because working men could not take multiple days off of work to vote. Additionally, the thus-conservative General Court elected the governor if no candidate received a majority, which tended to favor the large Whig plurality. However, the victories of the coalition forces in 1850 and 1851, made possible by the combined majority of their parties, provoked an about-face from the Whig delegates; they now argued for plurality rule, under which Whig dominance would be assured.
The Whigs also reversed their historical opposition to popular election of executive officers, elimination of the general ticket, and elimination of the poll tax.
Representation.
The primary issue at the convention was the problem of representation, which had been an issue with the constitution since its adoption in 1780. The coalition, led by Henry Wilson, hoped to preserve the town system of representation which had advantaged rural agrarian interests over the urban mercantile Whigs, while the Whig minority argued for proportional representation in both the Senate and House. The floor fight over representation last for nearly one month.
The resulting coalition proposals were reactionary in contrast to the otherwise egalitarian, democratic constitution. To this end, the committee on representation, chaired by Whiting Griswold of rural Franklin County, proposed a system by which less than one third of the electorate would choose a majority of Representatives. The Griswold plan was not straightforwardly a shift towards rural populations, but towns in particular. Under the plan, the rural (but staunchly Whig) maritime communities of Cape Cod, Nantucket, and Martha's Vineyard were underrepresented relative to agrarian Western Massachusetts, which had fewer people but more small towns.
Coalitionists argued that country towns had a "manifest difference" from urban life, appealing to history and morality. Free Soilers in particular stressed nativism, arguing that the disproportionate population of Massachusetts cities was in part due to massive waves of immigration. Even Bostonian Benjamin F. Hallett argued that cities "have great sores in them, which do not exist in the country."
Whigs, led by Rufus Choate, staked their argument on the principle of one man, one vote, which would entrench power in the Whig stronghold of Boston and eastern Massachusetts more generally. The Whig argument was straightforwardly populist, another apparent reversal from their history of conservatism. Choate and William Schouler noted that under the existing system, representation was granted by the "accident of place." Whigs readily made comparisons to the "rotten borough" system which England had already abandoned a generation earlier.
Coalition counter-arguments were largely resigned to cries of hypocrisy or the countercharge that, in the words of Francis W. Bird, "the district system ... would in a few years give the entire control of the State to the money power of Boston." On the final day of the convention, fearing that the constitution as written would not achieve popular support, Henry Wilson introduced a compromise provision that would abandon the Griswold plan and authorize the General Court to submit its own plan to popular vote after the next census. The proposal passed, though Whigs decried it as a "sham... to get votes for the Constitution."
Closing remarks.
At the convention's closing session, former Governor George S. Boutwell addressed a message to the people. He noted that
Up to that point, the Massachusetts Constitution had been amended 13 times, and some of those provisions had rendered parts of the document's original body inoperative. Boutwell asserted that "Constitutional laws should be plain, that they may be impartially interpreted and faithfully executed, 'that every man may at all times find his security in them'".
Final proposals and vote.
On November 11, 1853, the proposals of the Constitutional Convention were placed before the voters. Every single proposal, including the new Constitution, went down in defeat.
Proposition Number One
Adopted by the Convention and to be submitted to the people for a vote was a new Constitution overhauling that of 1780. Boutwell enumerated its main points:
Additionally, and this was not mentioned by Boutwell, the constitution provided that the Tuesday after the first Monday in November was to be the state election day, so as to align with the Congressional election day.
Boutwell closed by calling the adoption or revision of a constitution "an epoch in the history of a free people," stating that "We have no doubt that your decision will ... under Divine Providence, ... render more and more illustrious our ancient Commonwealth."
In addition to the new constitution, seven distinct amendments were proposed, numbered two through eight, as the constitution was number one. They were as follows:
Proposition Number Two
The writ of "habeas corpus" shall be granted as of right in all cases in which a discretion is not especially conferred upon the court by the legislature; but the legislature may prescribe forms of proceeding preliminary to the obtaining of the writ.
Proposition Number Three
In all trials for criminal offenses, the jury, after having received the instruction of the court, shall have the right, in their verdict of guilty or not guilty, to determine the law and the facts of the case, but it shall be the duty of the court to superintend the course of the trials, to decide upon the admission and rejection of evidence, and upon all questions of law raised during the trials, and upon all collateral and incidental proceedings; and also to allow bills of exceptions. And the court may grant a new trial in case of conviction.
Proposition Number Four
Every person having a claim against the Commonwealth, ought to have a judicial remedy therefor.
Proposition Number Five
No person shall be imprisoned for any debt hereafter contracted, unless in cases of fraud.
Proposition Number Six
All moneys raised by taxation in the towns and cities, for the support of public schools, and all moneys which may be appropriated by the state for the support of common schools, shall be supplied to and expended in no other schools than those which are conducted according to law, under the order and superintendence of the authorities of the town or city in which the money is to be expended; and such moneys shall never be appropriated to any religious sect, for the maintenance, exclusively, of its own schools.
Proposition Number Seven
The legislature shall not create corporations by special act, when the object of the incorporation is attainable by general laws.
Proposition Number Eight
The legislature shall have no power to pass any act granting any special charter for banking purposes, or any special act to increase the capital stock of any chartered bank; but corporations may be formed for such purposes, or the capital stock of chartered banks may be increased, under general laws.
The legislature shall provide by law for the registry of all notes or bills authorized by general laws to be issued or put in circulation as money; and shall require ample security for the redemption of such notes in specie.
Analysis.
The counties of Barnstable, Dukes, Essex, Hampshire, Middlesex, Nantucket, Norfolk, Plymouth, and Suffolk rejected every proposal. On the other hand, the counties of Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden, and Worcester voted in favor of each proposal, with support strongest in Worcester County, which approved each question by a margin of around 13,000 to 7,500. Bristol County was nearly evenly split on the questions, with proposals 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 carrying by margins of 31, 15, 74, 7, 54, and 35, respectively, while proposals 3 and 6 lost by 115 and 32 votes, respectively.
Had the convention submitted its proposed changes as individual amendments, "undoubtedly it would have proved a success," as evidenced by the adoption of most of its proposals as amendments in the coming years. The trouble was that it "did not know where to begin and where to end." On the one hand, it left the House of Representatives elected by the same method as before, and representation, since 1780 a contentious issue, "had been the real cause for the convocation of the convention." On the other hand, it took the radical step of reducing judges' terms from life to ten years for the SJC and Court of Common Pleas and three years for probate judges. This change "was too much; it brought down a veritable storm of excoriation upon the convention and its work, and resulted in the flat rejection of the whole."
Aftermath.
Although its ambitious proposals were all rejected, the convention's work was not for nothing: a series of constitutional amendments passed over the next few years incorporated many of the same changes into the Constitution.
Amendments XIV through XIX have a clear "post-convention" character to them, having been adopted by the 1854 and 1855 Legislatures and approved by the people on May 23, 1855:
Amendments XXI and XXII also bear the stamp of the convention's influence; they were adopted by the 1856 and 1857 legislatures and approved by the people on May 1, 1857:
Finally, Amendment XXXIV, adopted by the 1891 and 1892 legislatures and approved by the people on November 8, 1892, abolished the property requirement for the Governor and Lieutenant Governor.

<doc id="7009049" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7009049" title="Australian Cashmere goat">
Australian Cashmere goat

The Australian Cashmere goat is a breed of Cashmere domestic goats originating in Australia. Whilst retaining the fertility and hardiness of the bush goat, the Australian Cashmere is quite different in appearance and temperament. In midwinter, it has an excellent overall coverage of long, dense cashmere.
History.
Goats were liberated on the islands off the coast of Australia by Dutch and Portuguese navigators long before the British settlement of Australia. The introduced goats came from a great variety of backgrounds and they acclimatised readily to the Australian environment. Most pre-1830 prints of early Australia show the animals on the hills in the background as goats. Some early efforts were made to develop a goat fleece industry in Australia. William Riley, in 1832 imported "Angora-Cachemire" animals to his property, Raby, New South Wales. In that year, he delivered a paper to the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of New South Wales in an effort to encourage the development of a Cashmere/Angora fleece industry in Australia. A further 150 years were needed for Australian graziers to develop some of his concepts. An advertisement also appeared in 1832 in the Western Australia publication "Colonial Paper" for young half-bred Cashmere bucks offered for sale at three pounds each by W. Tanner of Caversham.
The gold rush period likely brought the demise of the infant goat industry. Prior to the gold rush, flocks of grazing animals, goats and sheep were controlled by shepherds. Most abandoned their charges in favour of making their fortune on the gold fields. The landowners then had to make some attempt at fencing their runs. Rudimentary fences could be erected to control sheep, which on large runs without fences would keep to the open plains. The goats were not controlled by fences and actively sought the rougher country as their browsing environment, thus forming the large herds of wild (or bush) goats that became well established in much of inland Australia. Eventually, the spread of settlement pushed these herds back into the semiarid, sparsely settled areas of the country.
Other introductions occurred in Australia in the 1800s. Wilson (1873) records that Dr. Chalmers imported 49 Cashmere goats through Melbourne in 1863 from Chinese Tartery. At this time, Wilson was running his own flock of Cashmere goats at Longerenong in Western Victoria. These were descendants of one male and two females imported from India.
Through the intervening years, history records many references to goats in Australia. In 1879, herds of goats roaming the streets of Sydney created such a nuisance that police action was required to get them away. Goat racing in which goats were driven by youths in light gigs became very popular at the end of the century, particularly in Queensland. The famous opera singer, Dame Nellie Melba, was so taken with the spectacle at Rockhampton, Queensland, that she arranged for the running of the Melba Derby.
Cashmere rediscovered.
Cashmere was effectively rediscovered on Australian goats in 1972 when two Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) researchers, Dr. Ian Smith and Mr. Wal Clarke, identified cashmere on some feral goats under inspection at the property of the Australian Mohair Company at Brewarrina. For a number of years, the CSIRO maintained a small research herd of selected animals at their Prospect laboratory until budget restraints forced their dispersal. Some important early histological work was carried out during this period.
By the late 1970s, a number of breeders were toying with the concept of developing and breeding an Australian Cashmere goat. Much of this early breeding was hampered by a lack of knowledge of the problems involved and by lack of a fibre market.
Interest and morale were given a major boost when in August 1980 Dawson International Limited PLC, Scotland, then the world's largest cashmere processors, purchased a property at Adelong, N.S.W., with the view to setting up a demonstration farm to encourage Australian cashmere production. The chairman of Dawson International Limited, Sir Alan Smith, saw the world cashmere supply situation tightening. Although cashmere represented only a small percentage of the volume of fibre handled by the company, it accounted for 50% of the turnover and was a major contributor to company profitability.

In 1836 he formed a partnership with James Nasmyth which led to the creation of Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company and the building of the Bridgewater Foundry at Patricroft near Manchester. Nasmyth recalls this in his biography "He had served his time at Yates and Cox, iron merchants, of Liverpool. Having obtained considerable experience in the commercial details of that business, and being possessed of a moderate amount of capital, he was desirous of joining me, and embarking his fortune with me. He was to take charge of the counting-house department, and conduct such part of the correspondence as did not require any special knowledge of mechanical engineering. I am much pleased by the frank and friendly manner of Mr. Gaskell, and I believe that the feeling between us was mutual. We continued working together for a period of sixteen years; and I believe Mr. Gaskell had no reason to regret his connection to the Bridgewater Foundry".
Marriage.
Gaskell married Frances Ann Bellhouse in 1841, who was the daughter of Henry Bellhouse of Manchester and niece of David Bellhouse, the Manchester builder Nasmyth and Gaskell had contracted during the initial building of the Patricroft site. Over the next 14 years they had nine children, six daughters and three sons.
Gaskell, Deacon and Co..
In 1855 Gaskell was well enough to enter into a second partnership with the industrial chemist Henry Deacon, who had worked with him in Nasmyth, Gaskell &amp; Co. Nasmyth wrote "In course of time the alarming symptoms [of his illness] departed, and he recovered his former health. He then embarked in an extensive soda manufactory, in conjunction with one of our pupils, whose taste for chemistry was more attractive to him than engine-making. A prosperous business was established, and at the time I write these lines [1885] Mr. Gaskell continues a hale and healthy man, the possessor of a large fortune, accumulated by the skillful manner in which he has conducted his extensive affairs."
Deacon's plant in Widnes was set up to develop the ammonia-soda process that Deacon believed he could make successful. However, after various setbacks Gaskell could not see this making money and he forced Deacon to abandon the venture. Instead they established one of the largest and most successful Leblanc factories in Widnes. Gaskell's three sons, Holbrook II, James Bellhouse Gaskell and Frank Gaskell all became partners in the company.
In 1860 when the governments of Britain and France formed a treaty to raise duties on materials made from salt, Holbrook Gaskell went with Edmund Knowles Muspratt to Paris to negotiate terms for the manufacturers. Gaskell remained a director of the company until 1890 when it became part of the United Alkali Company. He became vice-president and later president of that company.
Other activities.
Gaskell served as a magistrate in Widnes, was an active liberal and a member of the Liverpool Reform Club, supporting causes including the extension of the franchise. He endowed a chair of botany and provided chemistry laboratories at University College, Liverpool. He paid for public baths in Widnes and supported convalescent homes in Heswall and Southport. He was involved with the "Liverpool Daily and Weekly Post and Echo" and when this amalgamated with the "Liverpool Mercury" in 1904 he became its chairman. He owned a fine art collection which included works by Turner and Constable which was loaned to the Walker Art Gallery in 1885.
With his accumulated wealth Holbrook Gaskell moved to Woolton Woods in Much Woolton. He became a renowned collector of orchids. Frederick Sander, an orchid dealer, received a new Cattleya species in 1883 from his collector Seidl and named it "Cattleya gaskelliana" after Holbrook Gaskell in recognition of a good customer and someone who "by great diligence has acquired one of the finest collections of orchids in the North of England".
When he died in 1909 at Woolton Woods his probate was almost £500,000. He was buried in the churchyard of Cairo Street chapel, Warrington. The estate of Woolton Woods passed to his sons who sold it to Col. James P. Reynolds, who in turn sold it to Liverpool City Council.

Colossus (Ferris wheel)

Colossus is a Ferris wheel located at the 1904 World's Fair section of Six Flags St. Louis in Eureka, Missouri. It opened on April 18, 1986, and is in diameter, weighs , and has a maximum capacity of 320 people.
The ride debuted at the 1984 New Orleans World's Fair, one of multiple rides at the fair that were operated by Six Flags. About three years after being at the fair, it was relocated to Six Flags St. Louis.
History.
1984 New Orleans World's Fair.
Colossus was originally debuted at the 1984 New Orleans World's Fair, under the name "Giant Wheel" in the Bayou Plaza area of the fairgrounds. It and the other rides there were operated by Six Flags, and it cost $2.50 per passenger to ride. It turned at a rate of 1½ revolutions per minute which equates to . The ride first opened on May 19, 1984, a week after the rest of the fair, due to delays in assembly.
Six Flags St. Louis.
Colossus stands where the Pet-A-Pet petting zoo used to be. It was removed in 1985 to make room for the addition of Colossus in the 1986 season.
In 1988, an animated Jack-o'-lantern face made up of orange lights, nicknamed "Jack", and a corresponding lighting program were installed on Colossus for the very first year of Fright Nights (now Fright Fest) at the park. While the lights stayed on the ride all-year afterwards, they were only used for the Halloween season. The light program returned every year until 2016, when it was removed.
In 1992, 2,200 lights were added to the ride for the main season, which displayed a 24-pattern performance with a starburst finale. During the months that the park was closed, they displayed a giant clock face which was visible to those passing on nearby Interstate 44.
Incidents.
On June 18, 2009, a power outage at the park stranded some guests on rides, forcing them to have to wait until they were manually released by park officials. Colossus was the most difficult ride to release riders from, because, with no power, it had to be manually cranked to get the passengers to the ground, which took about 75 minutes.

Smendes II

Smendes II was a High Priest of Amun at Thebes in Ancient Egypt. He briefly governed from around 992 to 990 BC.
Biography.
The name "Smendes" is a hellenization of the Egyptian name Nesbanebdjed ("He of the ram, lord of Mendes"), while the ordinal number distinguishes him from the founder of the 21st Dynasty Smendes I, and from the later, namesake High Priest of Amun, Smendes III.
Smendes was one of the sons of High Priest Menkheperre and Princess Isetemkheb, the daughter of Psusennes I. He married his sister Henuttawy C and had a daughter, Isetemkheb E; another wife, Takhentdjehuti bore him Neskhons, who would be the wife of his brother and successor Pinedjem II.
His pontificate was short and left few traces, missing, for instance from the annals of Egyptian historian Manetho. He is mentioned on an inscription in Karnak, on mummy bandages and on a few bracelets found on the mummy of Psusennes I. Two extra objects bear the name of a "High Priest of Amun Smendes" but it is not possible to determine if these refer to Smendes II or the later Smendes III: these are a scribe's palette now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (47.123a–g), and a bronze kneeling statuette exhibited at the Musée royal de Mariemont (ref. B242).
He was succeeded by his brother Pinedjem II.

Swallow's Nest

The Swallow's Nest (, ) is a decorative castle located at Gaspra, a small spa town between Yalta and Alupka on the Crimean peninsula. It was built between 1911 and 1912, on top of the Aurora Cliff, in a Neo-Gothic design by the Russian architect Leonid Sherwood for Russian noble with German roots, Pavel Leonardovich von Steingel.
The castle overlooks the Cape of Ai-Todor on the Black Sea coast and is located near the remains of the Roman castrum of Charax. The Swallow's Nest is one of the most popular visitor attractions in Crimea, having become the symbol of Crimea's southern coastline.
Description.
The building is compact in size, measuring only long by wide. Its original design envisioned a foyer, guest room, stairway to the tower, and two bedrooms on two different levels within the tower. The interior of the guest room is decorated with wooden panels; the walls of the rest of the rooms are stuccoed and painted. An observation deck rings the building, providing a view of the sea, and Yalta's distant shoreline.
History.
The first building on the Aurora Cliff was constructed for a Russian general circa 1895. The first structure he built was a wooden cottage romantically named the "Castle of Love." Later on, the ownership of the cottage passed to A. K. Tobin, a court doctor to the Russian tsar.
In 1911 a Russian nobleman of German ancestry, Baron Pavel Leonardovich von (1880-1965), the son of Baron Leonard Vasilievitch von Steinheil (1843-1918) and his wife, Ekaterina Pavlovna Kamenskaya (1850-1929), who had made a fortune extracting oil in Baku, acquired the timber cottage and within a year had it replaced with the current building called "Schwalbennest". The Scots Baronial and Moorish Revival styles had been introduced in the Crimea in the 1820s by Edward Blore, the architect of the Vorontsov Palace (1828–46). Compared to the Alupka and Koreiz palaces, the Swallow's Nest is closer in style to various German fairy-tale-inspired castle follies, such as Lichtenstein Castle, Neuschwanstein Castle and Stolzenfels Castle, although its precarious seaside setting on the cliffs draws parallels with the Belém Tower in Portugal, or Miramare Castle on the Gulf of Trieste outside Trieste, Italy.
In 1914, von Steingel sold the building to P. G. Shelaputin to be used as a restaurant. For a short time after the 1917 Russian Revolution, the building was used only as a tourist attraction. In 1927, the Swallow's Nest survived a serious earthquake rated at 6 to 7 on the Richter scale. The building was not damaged apart from some small decorative items that were thrown into the sea along with a small portion of the cliff. However, the cliff itself developed a huge crack. In the 1930s, the building was used by a reading club from the nearby "Zhemchuzhina" (Pearl) resort, however it was closed shortly thereafter as a safety precaution due to the damage it had suffered in the earthquake, remaining closed for the next 40 years.
Renovation and restoration of the building began in 1968. The project involved the restoration of a small portion of the castle and the addition of a monolithic console concrete plate to strengthen the cliff. Since 1975, a restaurant has operated within the building. In 2011, the Swallow's Nest was closed for three months due to major restoration work estimated to cost 1,200,000 hryvnias ($150,000 USD).
In culture.
Owing to its important status as the symbol of the Crimea's southern coast, the Swallow's Nest was featured in several Soviet films. It was used as the setting of "Desyat Negrityat", the 1987 Soviet screen version of Agatha Christie's "And Then There Were None". The building was also featured in the 1983 Polish/Soviet co-production children's film "Mister Blot's Academy" as well as in "Mio in the Land of Faraway", a 1987 joint production by Swedish, Norwegian, and Soviet film companies.

Fathom Five (novel)

Fathom Five is a 1979 novel by Robert Westall, and is the sequel to "The Machine Gunners" (1975). The book combines elements of spy story with the rites of a passage of teenage life. The characters are now older than in "The Machine Gunners", and the themes are appropriate to their age. The transition from boy to man is one of the central aspects of the novel, and Chas is ultimately faced with a decision a mature adult would find daunting.
While "The Machine Gunners" tends to focus on the bombing and fear of invasion in 1941, "Fathom Five" fleshes out the world war. The ongoing effects of four years of rationing are covered (examples: Chas putting a hole in his trousers; the items brought by the different protagonists to a beach picnic; the Ministry of Food invitation to "Try our delicious Woolton pie"—a not-highly regarded meat-free pie). There is reference to the diaspora that has fled to Britain including: Scandinavian fishermen, the Maltese underclass, and Jewish pawnbrokers. It is through one of these that Chas encounters a widow of the Arctic convoys, which puts a distinctly human perspective on war. In addition the sheer banality of continuing war is alluded to, and a sense of late war fatigue which began to grip Britain at this time; reference is made to miners striking for better pay, and shipyard workers stealing iron rations from lifeboats, resulting in the deaths of torpedoed sailors.
As the plot develops, the author explores the social forces at work in 1943 Britain. Chas, the son of a gas fitter, embarks on a tentative relationship with Sheila, the daughter of a prominent local magistrate. The relationship between Chas and Sheila explores the hope and inexperience of first love. Upon meeting Sheila's mother, Chas is seduced by the prospect of "adults who you could discuss T. S. Eliot with", but the relationship is not approved of by Sheila's parents. In the end it is Chas's father who clarifies matters. The McGill family bookshelf consists of a shelf of Left Book Club titles including, we are led to understand, Orwell's "Homage to Catalonia". Chas becomes an avid reader of these and starts to understand the society in which he lives.
The book is largely unsentimental. The Maltese of the Low Street are described in pungent detail as petty criminals and vice merchants although Chas does establish a friendship with some of them. This is a development of the theme of maturity and also Chas's growing sense of political identity informed by what he has read in his father's books. No mention is made of the heroic resistance that had so recently been underway on the island of Malta, and the reader is left with a lingering sense of unjustified mistrust about one character until late in the novel.

Campo Indian Reservation

The Campo Indian Reservation is home to the Campo Band of Diegueño Mission Indians, also known as the Campo Kumeyaay Nation, a federally recognized tribe of Kumeyaay people in the southern Laguna Mountains, in eastern San Diego County, California. The reservation was founded in 1893 and is .
The reservation can be found "in the southeastern San Diego County atop the Laguna Mountains". Originally, the location was set on 710 acres in 1893. 80 acres were added in the winter of 1907, and another 13,610 acres were added in 1911. "All land on Campo is tribal-owned land; there are presently no allotments or assignments". The Campo Valley was known as Meelqsh G'tay (or big open meadow) in Kumeyaay language, and was known by its Hispanicized name as "Milguatay".
History.
Pre-Contact
The sovereign land of the Kumeyaay Nation ranged from the Northern outskirts of modern San Diego county to the western borders of the imperial valley and the northern tip of Baja California, Mexico. There were many clans of the Kumeyaay nation, one being the Campo or "Meelqsh G'tay". The multiple clans would join when in combat with neighboring threats.
Post-Contact
The Campo and their neighboring clans resisted the Spanish missionaries and soldiers. Notably, the Mission Basilica San Diego de Alcala, founded in 1769, proved to be troubling for the tribe and many revolts broke out. "The most famous of these was the attack and destruction of the San Diego Mission in 1775".
After the Mexican Revolution, the new Mexican government enforced a secularization of the Mission system. Most of the Missions became ranches where most Indian tribes of the region were forced to labor. In response multiple Indian revolts and raids in the region brought destruction to many of the Ranchos. "By 1842, the Ranchos had been abandoned and the warriors were attacking the last stronghold, the City of San Diego", however the city was not destroyed.
The Mexican–American War intersects with the Kumeyaay when US forces made their way into San Diego. Although the Kumeyaay "offered allegiance", they were directed by US forces to stay out of the conflict. This interaction thus led to an agreed upon distinction of land in the Treaty of Santa Ysabel. However, this treaty was "voted down and placed under seal by the Senate of the United States".
Through a combination of military conflicts, raid suppression, and migration brought by the gold rush: "population of Indians in California dropped by 90% from 1850 to 1860". And soon after 1870, the land of the Kumeyaay would begin to be divided and set into sections, thus defining the later reservations. "Further additions were taken into trust over the next 25 years including the first portion of the Campo Indian Reservation in 1893".
Modern Era
In time the Treaty of Santa Ysabel, and many others of its kind, were revealed to have been kept in secrecy. In 1927, supporters of the Mission Indian Federation, a Riverside County organization in the support of Native rights, came in conflict with the Bureau of Indian Affairs "police resulting in shootings and deaths on the Campo Indian Reservation".
Later periods of the twentieth century proved to bring minor justices to the Campo Indian Reservation, including "1960s public assistance and food programs", the Self Determination Act of 1975, and by 1978, "the Campo people designated the area near the Crestwood freeway off-ramp as an area for economic development". Since then the tribe has developed a casino and built a wind farm.
Government.
The Campo Band is headquartered in Campo, California. They ratified their tribal constitution on July 13, 1975, which established a governing council consisting of all band members aged 18 or over. The democratically elected Executive Committee currently includes:
Services.
In 1990, the Campo Band created the Campo Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA), which protects the environment and public health in the face of commercial development. The tribe also has the Campo Indian Education Center and Campo Tribal Training Program.
The Campo Kumeyaay Nation receives health services from the Southern Indian Health Council.
Topography.
There are two areas included in the reservation, found on US Geological Survey feature ID 270242. The address for the tribal government is in the portion of the reservation north of Campo and Cameron Corners. This area is shown on the US Geological Survey Campo and Cameron Corners, California 7.5-minute quadrangles. While not a true square, this part of the reservation is roughly one mile across on each side. A point suitable for finding the reservation on a map is latitude/longitude.
A second, larger area of the Campo Indian Reservation is located to the east in the area around the community of Live Oak Springs. This area is shown on the US Geological Survey Live Oak Springs and Tierra del Sol, California 7.5-minute quadrangles. This portion is rectangular: about six miles (10 km) in the north–south dimension and about in the east–west dimension. Live Oak Springs is located at latitude/longitude . The south extent of the area is about north of the Mexican border.
Economic development.
Muht Hei, Inc. is the tribe's corporation, which oversees Golden Acorn Casino, Campo Materials, and Kumeyaay Wind, a wind farm with 25 Gamesa turbines. The tribe owns and operates the Golden Acorn Casino, the Golden Grill Restaurant, the Del Oro Deli, and a travel center, all located in Campo. The 50 MW wind farm produces an annual power supply to bring energy to "about 30,000 homes and saves approximately 110,000 tons a year in greenhouse gas emissions". An extreme wind event in 2009 surpassed the IEC limits and caused damage, and all blades had to be replaced. A 1,000-acre project with 48-60 larger turbines (4.2 MW each, between 202 and 252 MW combined) is planned for the area, connecting to the 500 kV Sunrise Powerlink. For nearly 200 days and nights of the year, average wind speed varies between 4 and 10 m/s, producing some power.
Internet.
Portions of this remote area have wireless Ethernet Internet capability for tribe members. The service is provided through the "Tribal Digital Village" based on the Pala Indian Reservation, about north. This was reported in the "San Diego Union Tribune", "New York Times" and on the Community Television of Southern California program, "California Connected".
Education.
The reservation is served by the Mountain Empire Unified School District.

S.R.O. (album)

S.R.O., is an album by Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass, released in 1966. The title stands for "Standing Room Only," which is a term used to describe a sold-out performance where all the available seats are taken and only standing room remains. The album features the hit singles "Work Song" and "Mame," as well as other popular tracks such as "Flamingo" and "Our Day Will Come." It was the seventh album released by the group and reached #2 on the Billboard 200 chart.
Background.
The album includes work by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, as well as the band's cover of "Mame" (from the hit musical of the same name), the first of the group's recordings to include vocals by Alpert; he and the group sing the chorus in the middle of the otherwise-instrumental rendition. Released as a single, "Mame" reached No. 19 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in November 1966. "The Work Song", which features the "ping" sound effect of a hammer or pickaxe hitting rocks or other solid objects, reached No. 18 in July, and "Flamingo" peaked at No. 28 in September. The album reached No. 2 on the "Billboard" 200 chart.
S.R.O., an acronym for standing-room only, is a reference to the group's frequently sold-out concerts.
"Bean Bag" became famous in the UK as the theme song of the popular long-running game show "It's a Knockout", and as a prize cue for the game show "The Guinness Game".
The Dixieland-inspired "Wall Street Rag" was not the Scott Joplin song of the same name, but was composed by Alpert associate and Baja Marimba Band member Bud Coleman.
"For Carlos" was covered by jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery as "Wind Song".
Critical reception.
In his retrospective review for Allmusic, music critic Richard S. Ginell wrote "The arrangements are very tightly knit and don't allow much room for spontaneity, but they still sound fresh and uninhibited, and Alpert often allows the flavor of jazz to come through more clearly... Though S.R.O. only went to number two on the LP charts, Alpert's creativity and popularity were still peaking."
Personnel.
Along with Alpert, the musicians pictured on the album cover (excepting Julius Wechter) are:

Ron Settles

Ron Settles (June 12, 1959 – June 2, 1981) was a California State University, Long Beach and Banning High School football player who was arrested by the Signal Hill Police Department in 1981 then died while in police custody.
The morning after his arrest, Settles was found severely beaten. Police officers claimed they found Settles hanging in his jail cell from a noose created from a mattress cover, from which they cut him down. However, police elected not to take photographic evidence of the hanging and instead only took pictures of Settles on the floor. Also officers refused to testify—pleading the fifth, in what continues to appear to some to have been a conspiratorial 'smokescreen' or cover-up of police brutality. In 1981, a jury in a Los Angeles coroner's inquest ruled that Settles had died 'at the hands of another, other than by accident'.
A furor erupted afterwards about the nature of his death, as the police said the death was a suicide. No one was prosecuted for Settles' death, but the City of Signal Hill did pay a $1 million settlement to the family.
The case had long-term impacts on the reputation of Signal Hill, although a new police chief took steps to reform the police department. The case was an early high-profile case handled by attorney Johnnie Cochran, who represented the family; one of the policemen implicated in the incident was also represented by another noted civil rights attorney, Stephen Yagman.
Settles’ death was one of several highly controversial deaths of arrestees in the 1970s and 1980s that changed the way police departments deal with prisoners. Many of them now videotape jail areas and any time a police officer or correction officer touches a prisoner in a restraining way, a report is required to be written. These measures are intended to decrease the chances of police brutality in prison cells.
Settles' story was told by Dr. Michael Baden on HBO's series "Autopsy". Charles Burnett's 1995 film "The Glass Shield" was based, in part, on the Settles case.

European Confederation of Police

The European Confederation of Police (EuroCOP) is the umbrella organization umbrella organisation for 30 police unions and staff organisations in Europe. Representing the interests of over 230,000 police officers in 25 European countries, it was founded in 2002 at a conference in Roskilde, Denmark, emerging from the Union Internationale des Syndicats de Police (UISP), which had existed since 1953. It was created in order to enable further organizations, particularly ones from the United Kingdom, to join. The union's headquarters is in Luxembourg.
EuroCOP represents its members in European matters and at European Union institutions. For example, the union has an observer status at the Council of Europe. Its goals include enhancing the efficiency of police work under democratic control, the creation of norms for the qualifications of police employees, the preservation of the civil status of police officers, and the prevention of the privatization of police duties. One example of a current mission of EuroCOP has been to push the Spanish government to follow its election promise to completely de-militarize the Guardia Civil.
EuroCOP is part of the ETUC and ETUF making it one of the 10 union federations in Europe and the only one representing European police officers as an individual sector.
It is a member of the Council of Europe being part of the Conference of International Non-Governmental Organisations (INGOs) of the Council of Europe. EuroCOP is a member of ICPRA.
It is registered as a lobbyist.
In 2016 then EuroCOP president Àngels Bosch Campreciós met President Juncker and in 2018 she met Commissioner Julian King 
The organization should not be confused with the idea of "Euro-Cops", EUROPOL police officers, whose jurisdiction would reach into all of Europe.
Background.
The European Confederation of Police (EuroCOP) is the umbrella organisation for 30 police unions and staff organisations in Europe, which includes more than 230,000 police officers from 25 countries. EuroCOP was founded in a conference in 2002 in Roskilde, Denmark as a revision to the precious Union Internationale des Syndicats de Police (UISP), which had existed since 1953. The organization was created to allow police organizations from the United Kingdom to join. EuroCOP are members of the European Union Institutions, which allows the union to have a say in the council of Europe. The goal is to enhance the police work under democratic control, to prevent private investor of police duties, and to create norms for the police employees.
No. 83/2012 European Confederation of Police (EUROCOP) v. Ireland.
EuroCOP filled a complaint against Ireland on 7 June 2012, dealing with the fact that police representative associations in Ireland do not have full trade union rights, including the right to join an umbrella organisation. An umbrella organization is an association of institutions, who work together formally to coordinate activities or pool resources. The EuroCOP requested that Ireland grants complete full trade union rights for the police representations in Ireland. Meaning, that the police representative associations are kept out of the overall national negotiations that ICTU conduct on behalf of their members, such as those on salaries in the public service.

William Henry Merrill

William Henry Merrill (December 29, 1868 – September 17, 1923) was an American electrical engineer who founded Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in 1894.
Biography.
Merrill was born December 29, 1868, in Warsaw, New York. He was the son of William Henry Merrill Jr. (1840–1907), an editorial writer of the "Boston Herald", and Flora Agnes Judd (1842–1880). He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1889. In 1897 he married Bessie A. Henderson (1872–1956); they had five children. He was a member of the Midday and University clubs of Chicago and of the Sigma Chi college fraternity. He died on September 17, 1923, at the Presbyterian Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. His burial was held at the Merrill Plot at Warsaw Cemetery in Warsaw, Wyoming County, New York.
Career.
Merrill began his professional career as an electrical engineer in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1893, he was hired by insurers for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago to examine the safety of the electrical wiring in the Palace of Electricity. This experience led him to eventually found the Underwriter's Electrical Bureau in 1894, which later became Underwriters Laboratories in 1903. From 1903 to 1909, he was the Secretary and Treasurer of the National Fire Protection Association, becoming the President of the association from 1910 to 1912. In 1916 he became the first president of Underwriters Laboratories, which subsequently grew into an international safety consulting and certification company. In 1918 he was drafted for war service at $1 per year, serving as chairman of the fire prevention section of the war industries board.

Smart Messaging

Smart messaging is a proprietary service developed by Nokia used for the sending and receiving of various digital media via SMS.
Graphical.
Picture message.
A monochrome picture that can be sent between handsets as a series of SMS messages. The typical size of a picture message is 72x28 pixels, which is sent as three separate SMS messages. Most Monochrome Nokia handsets allow the picture message to act as a screensaver. Most color ones do not.
The picture message uses an implementation of the OTA bitmap.
Operator logo.
A monochrome picture that can be sent to a handset via an SMS gateway as either a single or a series of concatenated SMS messages. The typical size of an Operator Logo is 72x14 pixels, which is sent as two separate SMS messages.
Operator Logos sit in the middle of the screen and disappear when coverage is lost. The original intent of Operator Logos was to allow a Network Operator or MVNO to replace the name of their network (as stored on the SIM card) with their graphical logo, but human nature being what it is, people now usually get one that represents them rather than their network.
There is a workaround that allows a standard size Operator Logo to be sent as a single message, however, compatibility with newer or non-Nokia phones is uncertain. A more accurate way of reducing the cost of sending Operator Logos is to reduce their size to 72x13 pixels. This size would be sent as a single message.
The Operator Logo uses an implementation of the OTA bitmap.
CLI icon / Group logo.
A monochrome picture that can be sent to a handset via an SMS gateway as either a single or a series of concatenated SMS messages. The typical size of a picture message is 72x14 pixels, which is sent as a single separate SMS message.
A CLI Icon is a picture that will display on the handset when a call is received from someone whose number is stored in the handset as part of the corresponding 'group' (e.g. friends, colleagues, clients, etc.). The CLI Icon uses an implementation of the OTA bitmap.
Internal structure.
The content of each smart message sent is divided into two parts. The data header and the data content.
Data header.
The Data header is again divided into two parts, the first part is exceptionally small, only one byte in length, and defines the total length of the header.
After this there are one or more 'Information Elements', these tell the phone what to do with the information when it receives it. The two most common Information Elements are for Port Number Addressing (code 05) and concatenation (code 00) (telling the phone how to put together two or more SMS messages to make a single message).
The first byte of the Information Element Identifies (IEI) what information is to follow. The second byte of the Information Element is the 'Information Element Data Length' or IEDL. It tells the phone how many of the following bytes are part of the Information Identifier. The third and subsequent bytes of the Information Element are the actual information being conveyed. This is called the IED or Information Element Data.
A valid example of a Smart Message Header, expressed in hex is 0B0504158200000003010201.
This means:
 0B 0B is hex for 11. There are 11 more bytes to follow.
 05 This is the code for port addressing.
 04 The next 4 bytes of data belong to this Information Element
 15 82 Send it to Port 1582 (in other words, it is an Operator Logo)
 00 00 It was sent from Port 0000. This is not relevant for most Smart Message types, but must be included nonetheless
 00 This is the code for Concatenation. This content is being sent as multiple SMS messages
 03 Three more bytes of information belong to this Information Element.
 01 Message Reference No. If two or more items are being sent, giving them different reference numbers makes sure the phone knows which SMS messages belong to which Smart Message.
 02 Overall, there are two messages.
 01 This is the first message in the sequence.
Data content.
The data content varies depending on the type of smart message. With graphical types, it contains the OTA bitmap, and sometimes other information such as the mobile country code and Mobile Network Code. For ringtones, it contains the music etc.

Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus

Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is a syndromic autosomal dominant disorder where affected individuals can exhibit numerous epilepsy phenotypes. GEFS+ can persist beyond early childhood (i.e., 6 years of age). GEFS+ is also now believed to encompass three other epilepsy disorders: severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), which is also known as Dravet's syndrome, borderline SMEI (SMEB), and intractable epilepsy of childhood (IEC). There are at least six types of GEFS+, delineated by their causative gene. Known causative gene mutations are in the sodium channel α subunit genes SCN1A, an associated β subunit SCN1B, and in a GABAA receptor γ subunit gene, in GABRG2 and there is another gene related with calcium channel the PCDH19 which is also known as Epilepsy Female with Mental Retardation. Penetrance for this disorder is estimated at 60%.
Signs and symptoms.
Individuals with GEFS+ present with a range of epilepsy phenotypes. These include febrile seizures that end by age 6 (FS), such seizures extending beyond age 6 that may include afebrile tonic-clonic, myoclonic, absence, atonic seizures and myoclonic-astatic epilepsy. Individuals may also present with SMEI, characterized by generally tonic-clonic seizures, impaired psychomotor development, myoclonic seizures, ataxia, and poor response to many anticonvulsants.
Pathophysiology.
Type 1.
GEFS+ type 1 is a subtype of GEFS+ in which there are mutations in SCN1B, a gene encoding a sodium channel β subunit. The β subunit is required for proper channel inactivation. There are two known mutations in SCN1B that lead to GEFS+ (Figure 1). The first and best characterized of these mutations is C121W. This mutation alters a cysteine involved in a disulfide bond in the extracellular N-terminus of the protein. This extracellular region is similar to the cell adhesion molecule contactin and other cell adhesion molecules. It is believed that the disulfide bond disrupted by the C121W mutation is required for the proper folding of this N-terminus motif. Coexpression of SCN1B with sodium channel α subunits in oocytes and other cells results in channels that inactivate more slowly. Expression of C121W mutant along with wild-type α subunits produces current indistinguishable from that through α subunits alone. Further investigation of this mutation has indicated that it results in decreased frequency dependent rundown and, thus, likely hyperexcitability when compared to cells expressing the wild-type subunit. This mutation also disrupts the subunit's ability to induce cellular aggregation. The importance of this last fact is unclear, though it is presumed that proper channel aggregation within cells and cell-cell contact are required for normal neuronal function.
A second mutation has been found in one kindred with GEFS+ type 1. This mutation is in a splice acceptor site of exon 3. The loss of this acceptor site reveals a downstream cryptic acceptor site and a protein missing 5 amino acids in the N-terminus (I70_E74del). This mutation has not been further characterized.
Type 2.
A second subtype of GEFS+, type 2, is the result of mutations in SCN1A, a gene encoding a sodium channel α subunit. There are currently almost 90 known mutations in the SCN1A gene throughout the entirety of the channel (see table 1). These mutations result in almost any imaginable mutation type in the gene, short of duplications. The results of these mutations are highly variable, some producing functional channels while others result in non-functional channels. Some functional channels result in membrane hyperexcitability while others result in hypoexcitability. Most of the functional mutant channels result in hyperexcitability due to decreased frequency dependent rundown. An example of this is the D188V mutation. A 10 Hz stimulation of wild-type channels causes current to decrease to approximately 70% of maximum whereas the same stimulation of mutant channels results in rundown to 90% of maximum. This is caused by an expedited recovery from inactivation for mutant channels versus wild-type. The D188V mutant, for example, recovers to 90% maximal current in 200ms while wild-type channels are unable to recover to this degree in &gt;1000ms. Some other functional mutations that lead to hyperexcitability do so by other means, such as decreasing the rate of entrance into the slow inactivated state.
Some of the other functional mutations are believed to result in hypoexcitability. The R859C mutation, for example, has a more depolarized voltage dependence of activation, meaning that the membrane must be more depolarized for the channel to open. This mutant also recovers more slowly from inactivation. The nonfunctional channels are believed to produce similar changes in cell excitability. Likewise, many of the nonsense mutations likely result in nonfunctional channels and hypoexcitability, though this has yet to be tested. It is also unclear how this membrane hypoexcitability leads to the GEFS+ phenotype.
Type 3.
Patients with GEFS+ type 3 have mutations in the GABRG2 gene, which encodes the GABAA γ2 subunit (figure 2). The first mutation discovered in GABRG2 was K289M, in the extracellular region linking membrane-spanning domains M2 and M3. Oocytes injected with α1, β2, and γ2 subunits produce large GABA inducible currents whereas those injected with K289M mutant instead of wild-type subunits produce currents much smaller (about 10% of wild-type). This abnormal current is not the result of non-incorporation of mutant subunits since mutant containing receptors are still sensitive to benzodiazepines, a property for which functional γ subunits are required. Because of these results, it is believed that the GEFS+ phenotype in these individuals is a result of hyperexcitability.
Concurrent with the previous mutation, a second group found a second mutation in GABRG2 associated with GEFS+. This mutation, R43Q, is located in the one of two benzodiazepine binding-sites located in the extracellular N-terminus. Benzodiazepines, such as Diazepam, potentiate GABA induced current. This potentiation is abolished in cells expressing the R43Q mutant subunit instead of the wild-type γ subunit. This mutation does not affect the subunit's ability to coassemble into function receptors as it still confers resistance to GABA current blockade by zinc. As with the previous mutation, this mutation is expected to result in neuronal hyperexcitability.
The final known GEFS+ type 3 mutation is a nonsense mutation, Q351X, located in the intracellular region linking the third and fourth membrane spanning segments. When this mutant subunit is expressed in cells with wild-type α and β subunits it produces non-functional receptors. Since wild-type α and β subunits expressed alone are able to produce GABA inducible current this indicates that the mutation either prevents both coassembly of the mutant and wild-type subunits but also coassembly of the wild-type α and β subunits or prevents proper trafficking of the formed receptor to the membrane. Fusion of GFP onto this mutated subunit has indicated that it is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum instead of the cell membrane. As with other known GEFS+ type 3 mutation, Q351X likely results in neuronal hyperexcitability.
SCN2A mutations.
The final type of GEFS+ is caused by mutations in the SCN2A gene, which encodes a sodium channel α subunit. The first associated mutation in this gene is R187W, located on the intracellular region linking membrane spanning units two and three in the first domain (D1S2-S3, figure 3). Patients with this mutation have both febrile and afebrile seizures. Electrophysiological examination of this mutant revealed that it increases the time constant for inactivation, presumably increasing sodium current and leading to hyperexcitability. However, this mutation also yields channels that inactivate at more hyperpolarized potentials relative to wild-type channels, indicative of hypoexcitability. Whether the result on membrane excitability of this mutation is hyperexcitability or hypoexcitability is, as yet, unclear.
The second known mutation in SCN2A associated with GEFS+ is R102X. This mutation is located in the intracellular N-terminus (figure 3) and results in SMEI in patients. The result of this mutation is completely non-functional channels and membrane hypoexcitability. The truncated mutant protein also seems to cause wild-type channels to inactivate at more hyperpolarized potentials, indicating that it also acts in a dominant negative manner.
Management.
Long term management is by use of anticonvulsant medication, principally valproate, stiripentol, topiramate or clobazam. Ketogenic diet has also been found useful in certain cases 
Management of breakthrough seizures is by benzodiazepine such as midazolam.

Tom Walls

Thomas Kirby Walls (18 February 1883 – 27 November 1949) was an English stage and film actor, producer and director, best known for presenting and co-starring in the Aldwych farces in the 1920s and for starring in and directing the film adaptations of those plays in the 1930s.
Walls spent his early years as an actor, from 1905, mostly in musical comedy, touring the British provinces, North America and Australia and in the West End. He specialised in comic character roles, typically flirtatious middle aged men. In 1922 he went into management in partnership with the comic actor Leslie Henson. They had an early success in the West End with a long-running farce, "Tons of Money", after which Walls commissioned and staged a series of farces at the Aldwych Theatre that ran almost continuously over the next decade. He and his co-star Ralph Lynn were among the most popular British actors of their time.
In addition to his work in the theatre, Walls directed and acted in more than forty films between 1930 and 1949. Some of these were screen versions of the successful stage plays, others were specially-written comedies on similar lines, and there were also serious films, particularly later in Walls's career.
Away from acting, Walls's passion was horse racing. He set up stables at his home in Surrey and trained about 150 winners, including April the Fifth, his 1932 Derby winner.
Life and career.
Early years.
Walls was born in Kingsthorpe, Northampton, the son of John William Walls, a plumber and builder, and his wife, Ellen, "née" Brewer. He was educated at Northampton County School, after which he tried a variety of jobs, working in Canada for a year and, on his return, joining the Metropolitan Police.
In 1905 Walls embarked on a stage career. His first engagement was as member of a seafront Pierrot troupe in Brighton. He played in pantomime in "Aladdin" at Glasgow in the 1905–06 season, under the management of Robert Courtneidge. He performed in a concert party and in musical comedy, touring the British provinces and North America as the Jester in "The Scarlet Mysteries". In 1907 he made his West End debut, playing Ensign Ruffler in "Sir Roger de Coverley" at the Empire, Leicester Square.
Walls appeared in Edwardian musical comedies in the West End and on tour from 1908 to 1921. In February 1910 he married Alice Hilda Edwards, an actress on the musical comedy stage. They had one son, Tom Kenneth Walls. During 1910–11, Walls toured in Australia, playing Peter Doody in "The Arcadians", Mr. Hook in "Miss Hook of Holland", and the Marquis de St. Gautier in "The Belle of Brittany".
Back in London, Walls had substantial roles in "The Sunshine Girl" (1912); "The Marriage Market" (1913) and "A Country Girl" (1915). Later in 1915 he played Coquenard in a revival of Messager's "Veronique"; between then and 1921 he appeared in nine other musical comedies and a pantomime. His best known show of these years was probably "Kissing Time" (1919), in which he played Colonel Bolinger opposite Leslie Henson. His biographer, Sean Fielding, writes, "His forte was the portrayal of amiable philanderers or eccentric older gentlemen, usually with a forceful, even hectoring manner."
Actor manager.
Walls went into partnership with Henson and became managing director of Tom Walls and Leslie Henson, Ltd, controlling several touring companies. In 1922 the partnership presented the farce "Tons of Money" at the Shaftesbury Theatre. It was a great popular success, running for nearly two years. Walls played a supporting role in the piece and cast Ralph Lynn in the leading part, propelling Lynn to stardom. Walls took a lease of the Aldwych Theatre, where he and Henson presented another farce, "It Pays to Advertise", which ran for nearly 600 performances. To replace the piece, Walls acquired the rights to another farce, "A Cuckoo in the Nest" by Ben Travers.
Walls and Lynn co-starred in the Aldwych productions, and Travers was careful to maintain the equilibrium of their stage partnership by ensuring that each had as many funny lines as the other. Initially, Travers found Walls difficult as an actor-manager, and also distressingly unprepared as an actor. But even Walls's calls to the stage manager for lines became a popular part of opening nights at the Aldwych.
There were twelve Aldwych farces under Walls's management. The first eight averaged runs of 369 performances. The last four did less well, averaging under 150 performances. Walls gathered a regular troupe of supporting actors, including Robertson Hare, Mary Brough and Winifred Shotter. Travers wrote for these players, drawing on their strengths, his plays populated by:
In 1935 Tom Walls was the prominent name showing on a hoarding in Knightsbridge for Lady In Danger at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre 
Later career.
Walls made an early foray into films in 1924 in a silent screen version of "Tons of Money", though he did not reprise his stage role. When the talkies arrived, Walls moved his focus away from the theatre and into cinema. He directed seventeen films between 1930 and 1938, acting in most of them. He directed his last, "Old Iron", at the end of the 1930s. In the 1930s, Walls and Lynn regularly appeared in the lists of the top ten British film stars. Walls usually outranked Lynn in the top ratings, because, in the words of the critic Jeffrey Richards, "everyone warmed to the old reprobate whereas the 'silly ass' was not to everyone's taste."
Walls left Herbert Wilcox in the 1930s to be signed by Michael Balcon at Gaumont. He was given a strong contract, including the right of story and cast approval and the freedom to direct if he wished. Balcon later wrote "Walls and I were not great friends. In fact at that time I disliked him fiercely, and perhaps somewhat unreasonably. Every detailed point that arose out of the contract I contested and to every interview with me Tom Walls brought his lawyer...Our major disputes arose from casting problems, as Tom’s choices were not always made on acting ability." 
Balcon also claimed "Tom was basically a first-rate performer but, frankly, he did not understand films in any technical or creative sense and would not accept this fact because of his many successes in the early days of sound films." The producer felt that "first-class films could have emerged if only he placed himself in the hands of a competent director instead of believing he could do everything himself."
Walls continued to act on screen in both comedies and dramas until his death, often playing character roles in other directors' films. In 1943 he appeared in the serious film "Undercover" as the father of a guerrilla leader in Yugoslavia. His final film was "The Interrupted Journey" (1949).
In his private life Walls's great passion was flat racing. In 1927 he established a stable at his home in Ewell, Surrey, with up to twenty-five horses at any one time. Over the next twenty years his horses won about 150 races, including the 1932 Derby won by his April the Fifth. The expense of the stables, together with a generally lavish lifestyle, was a severe drain on Walls's finances.
In 1939 Walls took over the Alexandra Theatre in the London suburb Stoke Newington, which he ran as a repertory theatre. On tour and then at the Shaftesbury Theatre he produced and acted in a farce by Wilfred Eyre, "His Majesty's Guest" (1939). He toured in "Springtime for Henry" (1940), of which "The Manchester Guardian" commented, "Mr. Tom Walls is, of course, outstanding. Deliciously amusing, with a masterly attention to detail, his progress from sin to virtue and back again is a delight to watch". The following year he toured in Frederick Lonsdale's "Canaries Sometimes Sing", and in 1942 presented and starred in another farce, "Why Not To-Night?" on tour and then at the Ambassadors in London. 
His last stage appearance was in 1948, in a revival of "The Barretts of Wimpole Street", in which his performance as the tyrannical Edward Moulton-Barrett was thought to lack menace.
Walls died at his home in Ewell, Surrey at the age of 66. His ashes were scattered on Epsom racecourse.

Dravet syndrome

Dravet syndrome (DS), previously known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder which causes a catastrophic form of epilepsy, with prolonged seizures that are often triggered by hot temperatures or fever. It is very difficult to treat with anticonvulsant medications. It often begins before one year of age, with six months being the age that seizures, characterized by prolonged convulsions and triggered by fever, usually begin.
Prolonged seizures in the first year of life are the most indicative physical manifestation of DS. DS is diagnosed clinically, and genetic testing is recommended if there is any doubt. Due to drug-refractory epilepsy in DS, many other therapies are being explored to prolong the life expectancy of patients.
Signs and symptoms.
Dravet syndrome has been characterized by prolonged febrile and non-febrile seizures within the first year of a child's life. This disease progresses to other seizure types like myoclonic and partial seizures, psychomotor delay, and ataxia. It is characterized by cognitive impairment, behavioural disorders, and motor deficits. Behavioural deficits often include hyperactivity and impulsiveness, and in more rare cases, autistic-like behaviours. Dravet syndrome is also associated with sleep disorders including somnolence and insomnia. The seizures experienced by people with Dravet syndrome become worse as the patient ages, as the disease is not very observable when symptoms first appear. This coupled with the range of severity differing between each individual diagnosed and the resistance of these seizures to drugs has made it challenging to develop treatments.
Dravet syndrome appears during the first year of life, often beginning around six months of age with frequent febrile seizures (fever-related seizures). Children with Dravet syndrome typically experience a lagged development of language and motor skills, hyperactivity and sleep difficulties, chronic infection, growth and balance issues, and difficulty relating to others. The effects of this disorder do not diminish over time, and children diagnosed with Dravet syndrome require fully committed caretakers with tremendous patience and the ability to monitor them closely.
Febrile seizures are divided into two categories, known as simple and complex. A febrile seizure would be categorized as complex if it has occurred within 24 hours of another seizure or if it lasts longer than 15 minutes. A febrile seizure lasting less than 15 minutes would be considered simple. Sometimes, modest hyperthermic stressors like physical exertion or a hot bath can provoke seizures in affected individuals. However, any seizure uninterrupted after 5 minutes, without a resumption of postictal (more normal; recovery-type; after-seizure) consciousness can lead to potentially fatal status epilepticus.
Causes.
In most cases, the mutations in Dravet syndrome are not hereditary, and the mutated gene is found for the first time in a single family member. In 70–90% of patients, Dravet syndrome is caused by nonsense mutations in the SCN1A gene resulting in a non-functional protein. This gene codes for neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1. In mouse models, these loss-of-function mutations have been observed to result in a decrease in sodium currents and impaired excitability of GABAergic interneurons of the hippocampus. The researchers found that loss of Nav1.1 channels was sufficient to cause the epilepsy and premature death seen in Dravet syndrome.
The timing of the first signs and symptoms in Dravet syndrome occurs about the same time as normal childhood vaccinations, leading some to believe the vaccine was the cause. However, this is likely a non-specific response to fever, as vaccination often induces fever, and fever is known to be associated with seizures in persons with Dravet syndrome. Some of the patients who put forth vaccine injury claims from encephalopathy were later found, upon testing, to have Dravet syndrome.
Genetics.
The genotypic explanation of the disorder has been located on the specific voltage-gated sodium channel genes known as SCN1A. This gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 24.3 and codes for the alpha subunit of the transmembrane sodium channel protein. A mutation in this gene will cause an individual to develop dysfunctional sodium channel Nav 1.1, which is crucial in the pathway for sending chemical signals in the brain, causing the phenotypic display of myoclonic epilepsy in the individual. A properly functioning channel would respond to a voltage difference across the membrane and form a pore through which only sodium ions can pass. The influx of sodium induces the generation of an action potential by temporarily changing the electrochemical equilibrium of the cell. When the gene is mutated, the eventually translated protein improperly folds its pore segment within the cell membrane because it has different amino acid chemistry, which renders the channel inactive. It is also possible for a mutation to reduce the number of channels produced by an individual, which leads to the development of Dravet syndrome. Both dysfunctions, incorrect folding or transcribing a smaller amount of protein, can cause Dravet syndrome.
Currently, the SCN1A gene is the most clinically relevant; the largest number of DS-related mutations characterized thus far occur in this gene. Typically, a missense mutation in either the S5 or S6 segment of the sodium channel pore results in a loss of channel function and the development of Dravet syndrome. A heterozygous inheritance of an SCN1A mutation is all that is necessary to develop a defective sodium channel; patients with Dravet syndrome will still have one normal copy of the gene.
Dravet syndrome is associated with mutations in the SCN1A gene, but it can also be found in patients with other mutations. Likewise, the presence of a mutation in the SCN1A gene does not necessarily mean that the patient has Dravet syndrome.
- SCN2A: This gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of the sodium ion channel (Nav1.2). The expression of this gene increases throughout childhood (unlike SCN1A, which peaks at 7–9 months) and is primarily produced in hippocampal neurons. Mutations in the SCN2A gene have been found in patients with various syndromes, and unlike SCN1A mutations, patients often respond to sodium channel blockers.
- SCN8A: This gene encodes the alpha-8 subunit (Nav1.6) and is primarily expressed in excitatory neurons (unlike SCN1A, which is inhibitory). The clinical presentation is distinct from Dravet syndrome, and patients sometimes experience epileptic spasms (not typically observed in Dravet syndrome), are less susceptible to fever-related seizures, generally do not have myoclonic seizures, and often respond to sodium channel blockers.
- SCN9A: This gene encodes the alpha-9 subunit (Nav1.7), expressed in cells of the dorsal root ganglia, neuroendocrine cells, and smooth muscle. Mutations in this gene cause sensory disorders, including an abnormal response to pain. Some people with Dravet syndrome have been found to have mutations in the SCN9A gene, but there is likely a more polygenic cause of Dravet syndrome in these cases.
- SCN1B: This gene encodes the beta-1 subunit of the sodium ion channel, which regulates sodium channel entry on the outer side of the cell membrane. Mutations in the SCN1B gene have been found in several patients with Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus (GEFS+), but very few with Dravet syndrome.
- PCDH19: This gene, located on the X chromosome, encodes protocadherin 19, a protein that helps neurons adhere to each other as they migrate to form networks and recognize other cells. Because males only possess one copy of the X chromosome, even if this mutation occurs in males, it creates a type of cell containing functional protocadherin 19, so no problems occur. However, it is believed that females (who have two X chromosomes) are affected when one copy is mutated and the other is normal. Therefore, two different populations of cells containing protocadherin 19 are generated, and their abnormal interactions are believed to cause the disease's symptoms. Epilepsy with Mental Retardation limited to Females (EFMR) is its own syndrome, primarily affecting females, although it mimics and resembles Dravet syndrome in several aspects. Seizure onset is later in this epilepsy (an average of about 11 months versus the average of 6 months in Dravet syndrome), photosensitivity is less common, seizure clusters are more frequent and respond to steroids, an approach not used in Dravet syndrome.
- GABRA1: GABA is the primary neurotransmitter. The receptors on neurons that accept this neurotransmitter are called "GABR" (R for receptor) and are divided into two groups: A and B. GABRA1 encodes the alpha-1 receptor, and mutations are found in several epilepsies, including Childhood Absence Epilepsy, Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy, and Genetic Generalized Epilepsy. Some cases of Dravet syndrome are associated with mutations in the GABRA1 gene.
- GABRG2: This gene encodes the GABA gamma-2 receptor, and mutations have been found in patients with Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus (GEFS+), as well as in some Dravet syndrome patients.
- STXBP1: This gene encodes the syntaxin-binding protein 1, which is involved in the vesicle fusion process (sacs containing substances like neurotransmitters) of the cell with the membrane. Therefore, mutations in this gene can affect the cell's ability to release neurotransmitters. Mutations have been found in patients with Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, and nonspecific epilepsies with variable components of intellectual disability and movement disorders.
- HCN1: This gene encodes a non-selective positive ion channel (allowing the passage of calcium, potassium, and other positive ions), and mutations generally result in a gain of function. In some Dravet patients with HCN1 mutation, the presentation is similar to classic Dravet syndrome.
- CHD2: This gene encodes the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2, which modifies gene expression. All patients diagnosed as Dravet syndrome with CHD2 mutations began their epilepsy later than usual (ages 1, 2, and 3 years), which generally seems to be a common feature of CHD2 mutations. It has also been described in patients with Jeavons syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and other epilepsies.
- KCNA2: This gene encodes a delayed potassium channel that helps a neuron repolarize after activation. Patients believed to have Dravet syndrome with this mutation managed to remain seizure-free in adulthood, a result that is often not achieved in classic Dravet syndrome.
Diagnosis.
According to the Dravet Syndrome Foundation, the diagnostic criteria for DS require the patient to present with several of the following symptoms:
Treatment.
Seizures in Dravet syndrome can be difficult to manage but may be reduced by anticonvulsant medications such as clobazam, stiripentol, topiramate, and valproate. Because the course of the disorder varies from individual to individual, treatment protocols may vary. A diet high in fats and low in carbohydrates may also be beneficial, known as a ketogenic diet. Although diet adjustments can help, they do not eliminate the symptoms. Until a better form of treatment or cure is discovered, those with this disease will have myoclonic epilepsy for the rest of their lives.
Certain anticonvulsant medications that are classed as sodium channel blockers are now known to make seizures worse in most Dravet patients. These medications include carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and phenytoin.
As there are still very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) available, evidence-based therapy remains difficult: RCTs are now only available for the drugs fenfluramine (FFA), cannabidiol (CBD), and stiripentol (STP). A North American consensus panel and, subsequently, a European expert committee both established treatment guidelines.
As a first-line medication, valproic acid (VPA) is recommended in both published recommendations. The American recommendations provide clobazam (CLB) monotherapy as an alternative; however, very few European facilities would use it. It is a prevalent misconception that since the first seizures are typically hemiclonic (focal), antiseizure medicine (ASM) can be a good choice for focal seizures. However, using sodium channel blockers is not recommended as it can lead to fatal results over an extended period.
Children may experience fewer seizures and less severe, shorter seizures as a result of first-line therapy with VPA; however, it is uncommon for them to live a life free of seizures. According to the recommendations, second-line options include the ketogenic diet (KD), topiramate (TPM), and STP combined with VPA and CLB. The more current European recommendations now mention CBD and FFA as potential second-line treatments (in Europe, CLB and CBD are combined).
Treatments include cognitive rehabilitation through psychomotor and speech therapy. In addition, valproate is often administered to prevent recurrence of febrile seizures, and a benzodiazepine is used for long-lasting seizures, but these treatments are usually insufficient.
Stiripentol was the only medication for which a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial was performed, and this medication showed efficacy in trials. It acts as a GABAergic agent and as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptor. Stiripentol, which can improve focal refractory epilepsy, as well as Dravet's syndrome, supplemented with clobazam and valproate was approved in Europe in 2007 as a therapy for Dravet syndrome and has been found to reduce overall seizure rate by 70%. In cases with more drug-resistant seizures, topiramate and the ketogenic diet are used as alternative treatments. A Cochrane review, first published in 2014 and updated in 2022, called for larger, randomized, well-controlled trials to be able to draw conclusions.
Cannabidiol (CBD) was approved in the United States for the treatment of Dravet syndrome in 2018. A 2017 study showed that the frequency of seizures per month decreased from 12 to 6 with the use of cannabidiol, compared with a decrease from 15 to 14 with placebo.
In 2020, fenfluramine was approved for the medical treatment in the European Union and the USA.
Approaching seizures in adults.
Regarding the care of adult DS patients, no particular guidelines are available. The usage of VPA, CLB, and TPM continued through childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, although that of STP decreased with age (31% in adults), according to the findings of a survey of caretakers of patients with DS on their experiences with management and health services. According to reports, only a tiny percentage of adult patients receive treatment with sodium channel blockers, even though many of them had already been exposed to this class of ASM. It has been shown that certain DS patients may respond to sodium channel blockers, especially LTG, with a greater frequency of seizures noted upon halting the medication.
Prior to the age of 20, photosensitivity and pattern sensitivity each have a tendency to vanish; nevertheless, some individuals still displayed light sensitivity. Consequently, for those who are older, triggering variables ought to be minimized.
Disease-modifying therapies.
Modifying therapeutics are those which seek to correct the underlying cause of the disease. These types of treatments are into the known “advanced therapies”.
Stoke Therapeutics developed STK-001 is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that can modify gene expression in the nervous system. The FDA approved ASOs for the treatment of ten genetic disorders. The technique consists of targeted augmentation of nuclear gene output, which allows to selectively boost expression only in tissues where the protein is normally expressed. STK-001 can increase the level of productive SCN1A mRNA by preventing inclusion of a poison exon and consequently increase the expression of sodium channel gene SCN1A.
Stoke Therapeutics is currently evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of repeated doses of STK-001 in patients with Dravet syndrome. Change in seizure frequency, overall clinical status, and quality of life will be measured as secondary endpoints in this open-label study. Recently, the company announced positive results of MONARCH and ADMIRAL, in which patients received three doses of STK-001 and were observed for six months.
In parallel, Encoded Therapeutics is developing an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) SCN1A gene regulation therapy. It has been designed to target transgene expression to GABAergic inhibitory neurons and reduce off-target expression within excitatory cells. In this case, the treatment would be administered as a single dose intracerebroventricularly. This company has started a clinical trial in phases 1 and 2 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ETX101 in participants with SCN1A-positive Dravet syndrome aged 6 to 36 months.
Prognosis.
Numerous research studies have been performed to evaluate DS prognosis. According to two studies, status epilepticus and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) are the two most frequent causes of premature fatality among DS patients. Between ten and twenty percent of people with DS are thought to die before 10 years of age. The International Dravet Syndrome Epilepsy Action League (IDEA League) conducted a study in which they concluded that 31 of 833 DS patients died within 10 years. The average death age was 4.6 years, with 19 of 31 deaths because of SUDEP, 10 from status epilepticus, 1 from ketoacidosis, and 1 from an accident.
It is unclear what duration these patients are projected to live. A prospective study of 37 individuals showed that, by reducing status epilepticus from occurring at a young age, the prognosis for seizures and mental impairment in DS patients can be improved.
Epidemiology.
Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. It accounts for roughly 10% of cases of epileptic encephalopathies in children. It is a rare genetic disorder that affects an estimated 1 in every 20,000–40,000 births.
COVID-19.
Although it is not clear whether people with Dravet syndrome are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, 2020 publications have shown that affected individuals and their families have suffered some indirect consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as healthcare barriers, loss of therapies or economic issues.
History.
Charlotte Dravet first described severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy in Centre Saint Paul, Marseille, France, in 1978; the name was later changed to Dravet syndrome in 1989. Similar descriptions were given by Bernardo Dalla Bernardina in Verona.
Charlotte Figi, who was diagnosed as having Dravet syndrome, was the focus of a cause célèbre to provide a means for the use of cannabidiol for persons with intractable seizures. She died from pneumonia, possibly caused by COVID-19, in April 2020.

Pukekohe Park Raceway

Pukekohe Park Raceway was a former car racing track that was situated on the outside of the Pukekohe Park Thoroughbred Racetrack, located in the surrounds of Pukekohe.
The Raceway was opened in 1963 as a permanent track, replacing Ardmore Aedrorome as the host circuit of the New Zealand Grand Prix. The car Raceway was designed around the horse racing track that has been hosting thoroughbred races since 1920.
The New Zealand Grand Prix was held at Pukekohe Park Raceway on 29 occasions, the first being in 1963, and the last in 2000.
Pukekohe Park Raceway's Grade 3 licence expired 1 August 2022. The owner of the grounds Auckland Thoroughbred Racing (ATR) announced that it would cease hosting motorsport events on 3 April 2023, citing a desire to focus on its horse racing events and club facilities.
History.
The Raceway was opened in 1963 as a permanent track, replacing Ardmore Aedrorome as the host circuit of the New Zealand Grand Prix. Annually for several years, the mainly European based Grand Prix drivers such as Stirling Moss, Graham Hill, Jim Clark and Jackie Stewart, would head downunder for a relaxed Tasman Series during the European winter.
For many years Pukekohe was the venue for New Zealand's premier production car race, the Benson and Hedges 500 mile race (later 1000 km) featuring drivers such as Peter Brock, Dick Johnson and Jim Richards. In 1996 the New Zealand Mobil Sprints held one round in Pukekohe. Pukekohe Park Raceway also held an annual round of the popular Australian V8 Supercar race from 2001 to 2007. However, the New Zealand round moved to Hamilton Street Circuit in 2008. On 5 July 2012, it was announced that V8 Supercars would return to the circuit in 2013 as part of a 5-year deal with the circuit operators following a series of upgrades to accommodate for the series' return.
The changes to the track included a series of corners before the hairpin turn, meaning safer, slower races. The upgrades also included a new race control building, timing building and corporate viewing facility opposite the main grandstand as well as the addition of overhead pedestrian bridges.
In the centre of the circuit there is a thoroughbred racing and training centre, which dictates the use of the site as it owned by Auckland Thoroughbred Racing (ATR). The club is host to 14 horse race meetings a year and is used six days a week as a stables and training facility.
On 20 July 2022, ATR announced that it would cease hosting motorsport events on 3 April 2023, citing a desire to focus on its horse racing events and club facilities.
On 8 September 2022, iRacing announced that Pukekohe Park would be laser scanned and digitally preserved for sim racing after an online petition was launched. Over 7,000 digital signatures were collected and the petition gathered support from the "King of Pukekohe" Greg Murphy and three-time Supercars champion Scott McLaughlin, both former Supercars race winners at Pukekohe.
New Zealand Grand Prix.
The New Zealand Grand Prix has been held at Pukekohe on 29 occasions, the first being in 1963, and the last to date being held in 2000. Between 1964 and 1975, the NZ Grand Prix at the circuit was also a round of the Tasman Series. Winners of the NZ Grand Prix at Pukekohe include Kiwis Bruce McLaren, Chris Amon, Craig Baird, and Paul Radisich, internationals such as Australian Frank Gardner, Italian Teo Fabi, and Brazilian Roberto Moreno, as well as Formula One World Champions John Surtees, Graham Hill, Jackie Stewart and Keke Rosberg (Rosberg's wins in 1977 and 1978 were before his World Championship win in ).
Supercars Championship.
In 2008 the Supercars Championship round in New Zealand moved to the Hamilton Street Circuit so Pukekohe held its final event on the weekend of 20–22 April 2007. In 2013 Supercars returned to Pukekohe after the Auckland government confirmed that stakeholders would put $6.6 million into making the circuit more suitable for Supercars. These upgrades include a new chicane on the back straight, more pedestrian bridges and a makeover of the circuit's appearance.
Lap records.
The fastest official race lap records at the Pukekohe Park Raceway are listed as:

Mike Rashkow

Michael Rashkow (July 18, 1941 – January 23, 2013) was an American songwriter, record producer and the founder of an advertising agency called T:MC. He wrote "Mary in the Morning" with Johnny Cymbal. It was recorded by Elvis Presley, Glen Campbell, Al Martino, Dire Straits's Guy Fletcher, and many other artists. He formed Pineywood Productions with Ellie Greenwich in the late 1960s. Among the artists they wrote for and produced were Dusty Springfield, The Daily News, The Definitive Rock Chorale, The Fuzzy Bunnies, The Whatnauts and The Other Voices as well as Ellie Greenwich. Their publishing arm, Pineywood Music, published their own material and songs by other writers including Steve Tudanger and Paul Levinson, a member of The Other Voices.
Early life.
Michael Rashkow was born July 18, 1941, in New York City. As a child and young man, he grew up in New York and Florida, and he served in the U.S. Air Force as a psychiatric medic.
Music career.
Rashkow came to the music business without any background or credentials in the industry, having been a golf professional and a golf equipment manufacturer's rep from 1960 through 1965. His entree was via the recording studio and he became a recording engineer who worked at Bell Sound Studios, Studio 76, Sounds On Broadway, National Recording and Broadway Recording. His first songwriting partner was Mikie Harris (whom he later married), a noted NYC background singer of the 1960s who was later assistant to John Hammond. They signed as staff writers to Pamco Music, the BMI wing of ABC-Paramount Records, however they were not successful as a writing team.
"Mary in the Morning".
Rashkow began writing with his friend Johnny Cymbal, whom Rashkow had brought to ABC from Cymbal's previous staff position at South Mountain Music, the Don Costa/Teddy Randazzo firm. They soon wrote "Mary in the Morning", which became a worldwide hit. It has sold in excess of 10,000,000 recordings, and in 2010 attained BMI's Two Million Performance status for radio airplay. Rashkow and Cymbal wrote numerous other songs including "Julie On My Mind" which, as recorded by Adam Wade, became a hit in the Caribbean Islands and is today still well known among reggae enthusiasts.
During this period, under the name "Mike Lendell", Rashkow wrote, produced and sang lead on a novelty tune "Please Phil Spector" which was not released in the U.S., but received airplay overseas. That recording was subsequently included in a BBC documentary film about Phil Spector and more recently a tribute compilation CD titled "Phil's Spectre" on ACE Records. Contractual issues stalled the Cymbal/Rashkow writing partnership shortly thereafter, although in 1983 Cymbal and Rashkow reunited and wrote a number of songs for the Nashville market.
Partnership with Ellie Greenwich.
In 1967, Rashkow formed Pineywood Productions and Pineywood Music with Ellie Greenwich. This was Rashkow's most productive period. In addition to the artists mentioned above, Rashkow and Greenwich signed Steve Tudanger as a writer and producer. Tudanger was a founder of the seminal doo-wop group The Four Evers and had been a voice in the Archies. As an artist, Tudanger had releases on Mercury Records and Wes Farrell's Chelsea label; though well-received, these were not successful. His song "Let Me Be Forever", as recorded by Steve Feldman, became a #1 hit in several South American countries. The Definitive Rock Chorale was a studio group and a vehicle for the Rashkow/Greenwich writing team, and utilized the vocal talents of NYC "A List" background and jingle singers, including Ron Dante, Toni Wine, Jimmy Radcliffe, Tony Passalaqua, Cashman, Pistilli and West and Ellie Greenwich herself. Their release "Variations On A Theme Called Hanky Panky" charted and became a minor cult classic. Rashkow and Greenwich also wrote and produced music for The Hardy Boys, an animated TV series.
Other ventures.
Alone, Rashkow produced the radio personality and author Jean Shepherd and film personality Jason Holliday in spoken-word/comedy format, as well as Jesse Henderson, a Newark-based soul artist.
Shortly thereafter, Rashkow left the music business and went into advertising as a copywriter and creative director. In 1981, he formed his own advertising/graphic design firm, Two Minute Communications (T:MC), specializing in marketing for the race horse industry.
Within two years, T:MC became universally recognized as the outstanding marketing agency of its type. During that period, they represented numerous major farms and equine syndication organizations in both the US and Canada.
Their work in that field led to other areas of commerce. Changing the agency name to Group T:MC as they expanded, Rashkow revised the focus of the firm and developed a broad range of business-to-business clientele. Among their clients during the next decade were AT&amp;T, ABB, Community Bank of New Jersey, Merrill Lynch, Maser Engineering, Schoor/DePalma and Langeveld Bulb Company.
In 1985, Rashkow was among the founders of New Era Bank, Somerset, New Jersey. He was elected to the Board of Directors and continued on that Board until 1993 when the bank was sold. For five of those years, he served as Vice-Chairman of the Board and also directed the marketing for the bank's credit card division.
In 1998, Rashkow sold the advertising agency, and for the next four years he and his second wife, Barbara, became full-time RV-ers.
Personal life.
Michael Rashkow married Mikie Harris, his song writing partner in 1966 and had two children, Randy and Roger (Duke). 
Rashkow died on January 23, 2013, at a hospice near his home, surrounded by family.

Pulga, California

Pulga is an unincorporated community in Butte County, California. It is located along the west slope of the Feather River canyon. A variant name for the community is Big Bar.
History.
The land was once occupied by Konkow Maidu tribes. In 1885, the town of Pulga was founded by William King, a sawmill owner and railroad geologist. A post office was opened in 1906. The area had attracted gold miners and miners of vesuvianite, also known as "Pulga Jade". The town was always small, and peaked in size in the 1930s and 1940s with a few hundred people. The Western Pacific Railroad's Feather River Route line ran through the town and offered Vista Dome cars, designed and built with the scenery on this route in mind. By the late-1960s, this was no longer a train route and the mining business had dried up.
In 1994, the William King estate sold the town property, on which the Mystic Valley Retreat and School of Hypnotism was erected; most of the buildings have fallen into disrepair.
In 2015, the town was purchased by Betsy Ann Cowley. Crowley opened it as a feminist artist retreat and event venue, also named Pulga.
In 2018, high tension lines near the Poe Dam, north of Pulga, were the cause of the Camp Fire. Two buildings in Pulga were destroyed and others were damaged.
Geography.
Pulga is at the mouth of Flea Valley Creek, which gives rise to the toponym.

Manastash Ridge Observatory

The Manastash Ridge Observatory (MRO) is an astronomical observatory built in 1972 by the University of Washington. It is located in a remote area approximately west of Ellensburg, Washington, at an altitude of 3930' (1198 m), a longitude of 120.7278 degrees West, and a latitude of +46.9528 degrees, and can be reached by dirt roads from Ellensburg or Selah. The observatory features a Ritchey-Chrétien telescope built by Boller and Chivens. Currently, the observatory utilizes an Andor thermo-electrically cooled CCD camera in conjunction with the primary telescope. Initially used for professional and graduate research, the observatory is now used mostly by undergraduate students for instruction and research. For a brief time there was talk of stopping funding for MRO as the University of Washington Astronomy Department focus on the Apache Point Observatory, but funding did continue and MRO is still in use.
The Manastash Ridge Radar (MRR) is located in the MRO building. MRR is a bistatic, passive radar controlled by the University of Washington's Radar Remote Sensing Laboratory (RRSL) led by Dr. John Sahr. MRR uses commercial FM radio broadcasts from Seattle to sense ionospheric turbulence, meteors, and airplanes. The receivers are located at the University of Washington and at MRO.
In 2015 MRO was granted $59,999 from the University of Washington's Campus Sustainability Fund (CSF) in an effort to have the observatory run in a more eco-friendly manner. According to the project's Letter of Intent, the main goals were to reduce water and energy consumption. To conserve water they have installed a rainwater harvesting system that can hold of water in its tank and can fully supply the MRO's water usage. To conserve energy they have installed two solar panels which will produce more than the necessary 20,000 kWh per year needed to sustain the observatory.
The Telescope.
The MRO 30" is an f/13.5 telescope with achromatic focal reducing optics mounted approximately one inch behind the Cassegrain focus to create an effective focal ratio f/6.7. The focal reducing optics are optimized for the wavelength range of 3650-8520 Å. The field of view (using the Andor iKon-M 934 imaging camera attached to the telescope) is 8 x 8 arcminutes with a plate scale (using the default 2 x 2 binning) of 0.93 "/pixel.

MIQ (vocalist)

, previously known as MIO, is a Japanese pop singer and vocal trainer from Minato, Tokyo. She is known for her performances on the soundtracks of various anime, notably the theme songs of Sunrise's "Combat Mecha Xabungle", "Aura Battler Dunbine", "Heavy Metal L-Gaim", "Star Musketeer Bismark" and "Mobile Suit Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory". The throaty, soulful timbre of her voice was uncharacteristic of Japanese vocalists of the 1980s (although it has become more commonplace today).
MIQ has listed Aretha Franklin, Anita Baker, and Chaka Khan as influences on her vocal style. Her vocal delivery was a major reason she was signed to a contract with King Records. She is also fairly fluent in English as is evident by her English renditions of "Dunbine Tobu" and "Time for L-Gaim" and noted by fellow anime theme singer Ichirou Mizuki at ANIME JAPAN FES IN HK 2007 in Hong Kong.

<doc id="7009361" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7009361" title="Ages Ago">
Ages Ago

Ages Ago, sometimes stylised as Ages Ago! or Ages Ago!!, is a musical entertainment with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert and music by Frederic Clay that premiered on 22 November 1869 at the Royal Gallery of Illustration. It marked the beginning of a seven-year collaboration between Gilbert and Clay. The piece was a critical and popular success and was revived many times, including at St. George's Hall, London in 1870 and 1874, and in New York in 1880.
Background.
By the 1850s, the London stage had fallen into disrepute. Shakespeare's plays were staged, but most of the entertainments consisted of poorly translated French operettas, risque Victorian burlesques and vulgar broad farces. To bring family-friendly entertainment back to the theatre, Thomas German Reed and his wife Priscilla opened their Gallery of Illustration in 1855 and brought in Gilbert in 1869 as one of their many playwrights. The Gallery of Illustration was a 500-seat theatre with a small stage that only allowed for four or five characters with accompaniment by a piano, harmonium and sometimes a harp.
After Gilbert's first offering for the Gallery of Illustration – "No Cards", with music by Reed, Gilbert paired with Clay on "Ages Ago", the first of a successful series of collaborations between the author and composer that would continue for the next seven years. In the eight months between the productions of "No Cards", and "Ages Ago", Gilbert's dramatic style had developed. "Ages Ago", with its double-layered plot and its complex relationships among the characters, is more sophisticated than "No Cards", which was a simple farce. In addition, the lyrics move the plot forward more than in the earlier work.
"Ages Ago" earned praise from the critics, outran its companion piece, the popular "Cox and Box", and was frequently revived over the next decade. It was Gilbert's and the Gallery's greatest success to that date, running for 350 performances from November 1869 to June 1870. A review in the "Penny Illustrated Paper" described the piece as "a very brilliant, sparkling operetta, full of ingenious fun in the plot and dialogue, and exhibiting a good deal of grace and freshness in the music. ... The piece went off most successfully, a satisfactory proof that extravaganzas written without vulgarity can be relished by the public. The dialogue is smart as well as polished, and contains several hits on current town topics, not one of which misses fire." 
The work was revived at St. George's Hall in 1870 and again in 1874, among others. At the 1874 revival, Mrs. German Reed, Leonora Braham, Alfred Reed, Stanley Betjeman, Corney Grain, and the piece itself all received warm praise from the "Era"'s critic. New York's reopened Broadway Opera House was inaugurated in 1880 with a double bill of "Ages Ago" and "Charity Begins at Home". "Ages Ago" has been revived from time to time by amateur companies. In 2014, a production at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival, in the Harrogate Theatre, was billed as the first professional production in 130 years.
Gilbert produced four more pieces for Reed, including "A Sensation Novel" in 1871 and "Eyes and No Eyes" in 1875. He also wrote several comic operas with Clay, the last of which was "Princess Toto" in 1876. Thomas German Reed played Ebenezer Tare, while his wife played Mrs. MacMotherly. The piece also introduced Fanny Holland, who would play in many pieces for the German Reeds for years to come.
At a rehearsal for "Ages Ago", Clay formally introduced the composer Arthur Sullivan to Gilbert. The two later collaborated on fourteen comic operas that became the most enduring pieces of musical theatre from the Victorian era. Gilbert would later reuse many ideas and plot elements from these earlier works in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.
Synopsis.
In the haunted Scottish Castle of Glen Cockaleekie, where the title deed to the castle, much like "Brigadoon", is only found once every hundred years, Sir Ebenezer Tare has decided that, as "possession is nine-tenths of the law," he might as well be in possession of the castle until such time as the deed shows up again. Being the type of a Victorian money-grubbing elderly relative, he refuses to let his niece Rosa marry her poor suitor, Columbus Hebblethwaite, who is staying for the night. The Scottish housekeeper, Mrs. MacMotherly, has second sight. She tells a tale of the original wicked Sir Roger Bohun (similarly to Dame Hannah's tale in Gilbert and Sullivan's later "Ruddigore").
That night, the paintings of the castle's former owners come to life and step out of their frames (as would happen again in "Ruddigore"). However, a problem ensues: They were all painted at different ages, so Lord Carnaby, painted in the early 18th century at age 65, lusts after his grandmother (Lady Maud), painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century at age 17. Lady Maude finds more in common with Sir Cecil Blount, painted in the 16th century by Michelangelo at age 20. Eventually, though, and after some wrangling, Dame Cherry (painted by Joshua Reynolds in the late 18th century at age 56) and Lord Carnaby settle into middle-aged affection, while the "old" young people pair off romantically and get a painting of Brown, a solicitor, to marry them. 
At daybreak, they return to their frames, leaving the deed behind, which gives the property to Hebblethwaite, the poor suitor. He strikes a deal whereby if uncle Tare permits Rosa to marry him, then he will allow Tare to stay on at the castle, and all ends happily.
Musical numbers.
The music is written for piano, harmonium and harp. The published libretto omits three songs ("Goodbye Goodbye", "When Nature Sleeps", and "Eh! What is That Ye Say") which are usually included in the sheet music. The online Gilbert and Sullivan Archive states, "It is likely that there was additional dialogue accompanying these beginning songs, but if so this is now lost."
The following numbering of the songs follows that of the vocal score. The libretto does not include the songs through number 4, and numbers the song labelled as song 5 below as song 1. Thus, to determine the number given to a song in the printed libretto, subtract 4 from the number assigned to that song below.

Myrcia sphaerocarpa

Myrcia sphaerocarpa is native to the Amazon Basin of Latin America. The root extract, known as "Pedra Hume de Kaá" is used by the natives as a powerful healing poultice. Research has been conducted on it in Brazil as an anti-diabetic drug, calling it the "insulin plant".
Pedra hume caá is a medium-sized shrub that grows in drier regions of the Amazon and other parts of Brazil. In Brazil, the common name pedra hume caá refers to three species of myrcia plants that are used interchangeably-Myrcia salicifolia, Myrcia uniflorus, and Myrcia sphaerocarpa. It is unknown if reports on pedra hume caá can be applied to other species in the myrcia genus.
Pedra hume caá has been used by indigenous tribes in the rainforest for diabetes, diarrhea, and dysentery. The Taiwanos tribe (in northwest Amazonia) considers the leaves to be an astringent and uses them for persistent diarrhea. Pedra hume caá has had a place in Brazilian traditional medicine for many years.
It remains a very popular natural remedy for diabetes throughout South America; the traditional use is a simple leaf tea with a pleasant, slightly sweet taste. It is also used for hypertension (high blood pressure), enteritis (inflammation of the bowels), hemorrhage, and mouth ulcers.

Merrimac (formerly, Merrimack, Pea Vine, and Peavine) was an unincorporated community in Butte County, California located along Oroville-Quincy Road about south of the Plumas County line at an elevation of 3999 feet (1219 m). Nearby is Rogers Cow Camp, a campground in Lassen National Forest.
Merrimac was the site of a sawmill between 1870 and the early 1900s, and was the terminus of a narrow-gauge logging railroad. At its peak the town had 1800-2000 residents, a hotel, saloons, a bank, two blacksmiths, and a school. By 1955, only the hotel remained. When Plumas National Forest was established in 1905, Merrimac became the headquarters of the Merrimac Ranger District. The headquarters was moved to Brush Creek in 1930, but the name Merrimac Ranger District persisted until 1971.
The community was located along Oroville-Quincy Road between the towns of Buckeye and Junction House. As the name implies, the road continues to intersect with State Route 70 in Quincy. This road is also called Forest Service Road 119. Merrimac does not appear on the 1958 State of California highway map.

Portuguese Handball Second Division

Campeonato Nacional de Seniores Masculinos, Segunda Divisão (in English, Men's Senior National Championship, 2nd Division), just Segunda Divisão, is the second-tier handball league in Portugal. The best teams get promoted to Andebol 1, and the worst are relegated to the Portuguese Handball Third Division.
Almada AC is the most successful club, having won the competition four times.
The competition is played over two phases by 30 teams, initially geographically grouped into three zone groups.
The current champions are Arsenal de Devesa, from Braga.
History.
The second tier was established in 1966 as a result of the need for the expansion of national handball competitions due to the increase in the number of participating teams in regional championships. The competition was created under its current name for the 1966–67 season and ran for only four consecutive seasons, as in 1970–71 it was abolished. However, the competition returned the following year.
In 1982, a new top-division league ("Divisão de Honra") was created, and the Segunda Divisão became the 3rd tier of Portuguese handball. Nevertheless, with the creation of the new single round-robin league in 1985, the Second Division returned to be the 2nd-tier competition.
In 2001, another rebranding of the top division led to the Segunda Divisão becoming once again the 3rd tier of Portuguese handball. Moreover, due to the League-Federation dispute, the competition took an even lower standard between 2002 and 2007. During that period, the Segunda Divisão was "de facto" the 4th tier of the league system, although considered "de jure" the 3rd tier by the Portuguese Handball Federation.
As the dispute ended, the Segunda Divisão became "de facto" the 3rd tier of Portuguese handball in 2007.
As the Liga Portuguesa de Clubes de Andebol folded in 2008, the Segunda Divisão has been the level 2 league of Portuguese handball since the 2009–2010 season.

Channel X Radio

Channel X Radio is a network of radio stations in Aroostook County, Maine, United States. With studios in Caribou, the stations are heard through various transmitters throughout Aroostook County and broadcast a Classic hits format.
History.
The CanXus Broadcasting Corporation was founded in Maine in May 1986. Shortly after that, CanXus submitted an application to put a 3,000–watt transmitter on the Green Ridge Road, or on the Caribou/Fort Fairfield town line. On November 15, 1986 at 6:00 p.m., WCXU Caribou began operation on 97.7 MHz. The studios and offices were in a single-wide trailer while the transmitter was 400 feet away.
With a 3 kW signal and a small transmitter, people north of Caribou couldn't get the signal. Madawaska was the first place to get a satellite station. On January 30, 1988 WCXX 102.3 Madawaska began atop 11th Avenue Extension in a tiny studio, rebroadcasting WCXU. The signal reached all the way to Caribou.
Because of the valley-like nature, and the small power that WCXX transmits, the signal is degraded in most of Fort Kent. In late 1994, CanXus applied for W276AY on 103.1 MHz. This very small signal is located near the Northern Maine Medical Center and reaches only Fort Kent and surrounding towns. At the same time WCXU doubled its power to 6 kW, then later increased the output to 20 kW. Now the signal can go all the way to Houlton and Fort Kent in a radius. Since then, the transmitter building has doubled in size, the transmitter has become a little bigger (now Height Above Average Terrain (HAAT) of 90 m) and in 1998, Channel X moved to its new studio-office with state-of-the-art computerized broadcasting equipment.
In late 2006 WCXV in Van Buren began to simulcast Channel X Radio. It broadcast at a lower power until December 27, 2007, when WCXV began broadcasting at the full 6 kW. Later, CanXus changed their construction permit to decrease its HAAT to 1 m.
Bennett Radio Group acquired Channel X Radio from CanXus in 2023 for $400,000.
On January 1st, 2024, the Station changed formats to Classic Hits.
Programing.
Under CanXus ownership, Channel X Radio offered a mix of adult contemporary, oldies, and local music. In 2024, under new management (the Bennett Radio Group), it changed formats to Classic Hits. It is home to one of the longest running oldies and retro music programs in the region. Furthermore, Channel X Radio covers local events and broadcasts live interviews from around the region. The station broadcasts local sports updates and news stories on a daily basis.

Ashland Transportation Center

Ashland Transportation Center is an intermodal transit station in Ashland, Kentucky. Jointly operated by the City of Ashland and CSX Transportation, it currently serves Amtrak's "Cardinal" train as well as the Ashland Bus System, Greyhound Lines, and regional shuttles. It is located at 99 15th Street near downtown Ashland.
History.
Chesapeake and Ohio era.
The station is located in a former Chesapeake and Ohio Railway freight house originally built in the 1890s. Railway services formerly operated out of the Chesapeake and Ohio passenger station nearby (currently a PNC Bank branch). In the early 1960s the following named trains served the station daily: "Fast Flying Virginian" (west to Cincinnati, and sections east to Washington, D.C., and Newport News), "George Washington" (sections west to Cincinnati and Louisville, and sections east to Washington, D.C., and Newport News) and the "Sportsman" (northwest to Detroit, and sections east to Washington, D.C., and Newport News).
Prior to the 1971 shift of long-distance passenger train services from private companies to Amtrak, the C&amp;O's "George Washington" had a main section going north to Columbus, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan, a section running west from Ashland to Louisville, and east-bound sections going to Washington, D.C., and Newport News.
Amtrak era.
In 1975, Amtrak abandoned the original station (which served the daily "James Whitcomb Riley" train) in favor of nearby Tri-State Station in Catlettsburg. The city purchased the former freight house in 1997 using more than $500,000 in federal funds obtained through the Intermodal Surface Transportation Enhancement Act of 1991 in order to restore it as an intermodal transit station serving rail as well as buses. Amtrak moved rail services to the restored facility on March 11, 1998.
The station is jointly owned by the City of Ashland and CSX Transportation and is operated in co-operation with the city, Amtrak, Greyhound Lines and the Ashland Bus System. The station has an enclosed waiting area with restrooms and water fountains, but no Amtrak station services area available. There is a Greyhound ticket agent available at specified times. The station serves Amtrak's "Cardinal", trains 50 and 51. The tracks at the station are currently owned by CSX Transportation.
Mor'Trans, Sandy Valley Transportation Services and Northeast Kentucky Community Action Agency provide connections to Ashland from surrounding counties.

Bush. In 2004, she was a reporter with the "Ottawa Citizen" at the time of the raid, and she had earlier served as a foreign correspondent in Moscow.
House raid.
On January 21, 2004 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police raided her house as part of an attempt to identify the leak. During the raid, police seized notebooks, files, hard drives and other materials.
In November 2004, Ontario Superior Court Judge Lynn Ratushny ruled that the sealing of the search warrants was unacceptable, although Justice of the Peace Richard Sculthorpe had given approval after the RCMP invoked the Security of Information Act. Justice Ratushny stated that the sealing of the search violated guarantees of a free press, freedom of expression and the publics right to an open court system. She ordered that a redacted copy be released to the public.
In October 2006, Ontario Superior Court Judge Ratushny struck down Section 4 of the Security of Information Act, ruling that it was "unconstitutionally vague" and broad and an infringement of freedom of expression.
All materials seized from O'Neill were ordered returned.
O'Neill was represented by attorneys Rick Dearden and Wendy Wagner from Gowlings a law firm with offices in Ottawa.
Awards and honors.
In 1996 O'Neill was awarded a Southam Fellowship. In 2005 she was honored with the World Press Freedom Award . In 2009 she was honored with the Charles Lynch Award for Outstanding Coverage of National Affairs.

Andebol 1

The Campeonato Nacional de Andebol Masculino (English: Men's Handball National Championship), also known simply as Andebol 1 (or Campeonato Placard Andebol 1 for sponsorship reasons), is the premier handball league in Portugal and is overseen by the Portuguese Handball Federation.
The competition was created in 1951 and was formerly named "Campeonato Nacional da Primeira Divisão" (1951–1982 and 1985–2001), "Divisão de Elite" (2002–2006), and "Liga Portuguesa de Andebol" (2001–2009). Seven teams have won the league title since its inception.
Sporting CP are the current champions with 23 titles, followed by FC Porto with 24 titles and ABC with 13.
History.
Creation of the league.
Handball was first introduced in Portugal in 1929 and in 1939 the Portuguese Handball Federation is established. During the first half of the 20th century, the sport became increasingly trendy, becoming one of the most important team sports in Portugal, aside football and roller hockey. The increasing number of clubs featuring handball teams had already led to the establishment of regional championships in the regions of Metropolitan Lisbon and Greater Porto, as well as around Coimbra. The interest in defining a "national champion" led the federation to create a small tournament between the best teams of Lisbon and Porto (at first) and Coimbra (in a second phase).
Sporting and Porto dominion until the Carnation Revolution.
Of the 23 championships played before the Carnation Revolution, only three were not won by Sporting CP or FC Porto. The two teams readily established themselves as the top-clubs in the country, growing after their eclecticism. Both teams featured the best Portuguese players of that time, sparking up a North-South rivalry between Porto and Lisbon, respectively.
FC Porto won the first "tetracampeonato" (4 titles in a row) in the history of the competition. On the other side, Sporting CP won the first "pentacampeonato" (5 titles in a row) in the history of the Portuguese handball, with a team that became known as "Os Sete Magníficos" (in English, The Seven Magnificent).
A real league in the European handball.
In 1985, the championship assumed a league format disputed with 12 teams. This change in the competition format approximated the Portuguese league to other major European leagues and accounted for a significant increase in competitiveness. This consistent growth was backed by the investments made by multiple clubs, who sought to secure some foreign players (especially from the Balkans) as well as experienced and well-regarded coaches, whose knowledge of the sport allowed a solid increase in playing quality.
The peak of the growth of the club handball in Portugal was achieved by ABC, from Braga, when they reached the final of the first EHF Champions League final in 1994. They lost to CB Cantabria by 45–43. In 1999-00, ABC also reached the semi-finals of the EHF Cup.
League-Federation dispute and decline.
In 2001, the clubs created an independent association, the Liga Portuguesa de Clubes de Andebol (in English, Portuguese Handball Clubs League), whose goal was to oversee a fully professional handball league, called Liga Portuguesa de Andebol (in English, Portuguese Handball League). However, in 2002, the Portuguese Handball Federation disputed the validity of the League and eventually refused accept the Liga Portuguesa de Andebol champions as "national champions".
As a consequence of the dispute, second-tier was renamed to Divisão de Elite (in English, Elite Division) and transformed into the official first-tier of the Portuguese handball. Its champions were declared "Portuguese champions".
The most dramatical consequence was the inability of the big professional clubs playing in Liga Portuguesa de Andebol to enter European Handball Federation competitions.
In 2005, the Federation finally recognised the Liga Portuguesa de Andebol as the first-tier of the Portuguese handball league system and agreed to granting autonomy to the League while overseeing it at the same time.
The fall of the League and the regrowth of club handball.
The Liga Portuguesa de Clubes de Andebol folded in 2008, bringing the Liga Portuguesa de Andebol to an end. The short-lived competition was replaced by the new Andebol 1 (in English, Handball One) under the scope of the Portuguese Handball Federation. Since the rebranding of the championship in the 2009–2010 season, Portuguese club handball regained some of its notoriousness, namely in the international competitions. Sporting CP won the EHF Challenge Cup in 2010 and 2017 and ABC won the competition in 2016, in the first solely-Portuguese European final in the history of handball, beating Benfica by an aggregate of 53–51. ABC had also reached the final of the EHF Challenge Cup in 2015.
In the 2013–14 season, FC Porto became the first Portuguese team to participate in the group stage of the EHF Champions League since 2002. FC Porto, ABC and Sporting CP also participated in the 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 editions, although none of them passed through the group stage.
But the biggest achievement by Portuguese teams in international competitions run by EHF was Benfica win of 2021–22 season, defeating SC Magdeburg 40-39, in a dramatic final solved in the last second of the Extra-Time.
Format.
Current format.
Since 2016, the competition is disputed in two phases (First Phase and Final phase).
During the First Phase, the 14 participating teams play themselves twice, in a league schedule, home and away. Each team plays, therefore, 26 matches during this phase. The top-6 teams qualify for the Group A of the Final Phase, whereas the 7th to 14th-placed teams qualify for the Group B of the Final Phase.
For the Final Phase, each team starts this phase of the competition with half of the points earned during the First Phase. During the Final Phase, the teams will play each other twice, in a league schedule, home and away. The Group A consists of the top-6 teams of the First Phase and will determine the final standings from the 1st to 6th-placed team. The Group B consists of the other 8 teams and will determine the final standings from the 7th to the 14th-placed teams.
The two bottom-placed teams in the Final Phase – Group B are relegated to the Second Division.
Currently, the champion qualifies to the EHF Champions League. The 2nd and 3rd-placed to the EHF Cup (the 2nd to the 2nd Qualifying Round and the 3rd to the 1st Qualifying Round). The 4th-placed team qualifies to the EHF Challenge Cup.
Former formats.
Early years.
On the first season (1951–52), the championship was played as a knockout tournament between four teams of Metropolitan Greater Lisbon region.
Then, from 1952 to 1962, the championship a mini-league was played between the best two teams of the regional championships of the districts of Lisbon and Porto to determine the national champion.
During the following two seasons, the mini-league was expanded from 8 then to 10 teams, to accommodate teams from the districts of Aveiro and Setúbal and, then, Coimbra.
Regional grouping period.
From the 1962–63 to the 1984–1985 season, the championship was held in two phases. During the regular phase, the teams were distributed for a variable number of groups (2, 3 or 4) according to location criteria. The top teams of each group qualified for a brief Final Phase to determine the national champion.
The 1973–74 season was an exception to this format, as a single mainland championship was established, featuring 12 teams from the continental Portugal. This championship was to serve as a qualifying competition to a final knockout phase, which would include teams from the islands (Azores and Madeira) and the Portuguese colonies. Because of the coup d'état on 25 April and the revolution period that succeeded it, the final phase never happened and the winner of the former round was declared national champion.
Since 1985.
Since the 1985–86 season that the same format has been used with slight changes. The competition has evolved from 12 teams to 10 teams. Then, back to 12 teams and increased to 14 teams in 2016. The regular phase has always been succeeded by a final phase, disputed either in a small league with 4 or 6 teams and in a knockout format. The knockout format was lately tried on the 2015–2016 season, but it was changed back the following season. The format of the final phase (play-offs vs. mini-league) is still a topic of debate between the Portuguese clubs and fans.

Francis Neale

Francis Ignatius Neale (June 3, 1756December 20, 1837), also known as Francis Xavier Neale, was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit who led several academic and religious institutions in Washington, D.C., and Maryland. He played a substantial role in the Jesuit order's resurgence in the United States.
Born to a prominent Maryland family, Neale was educated at the Colleges of Bruges and Liège, where he was ordained a priest. When Neale returned to the United States in 1788, he became the pastor of the church at St. Thomas Manor, where he aligned himself with the rural clergy in opposing Bishop John Carroll's founding of Georgetown College, believing it would draw resources away from the Jesuits' rural manors. He would conflict with Carroll over various issues for much of his life.
In 1790, Neale oversaw the establishment of the first Catholic church in Washington, D.C., Holy Trinity Church, of which he was pastor for 27 years. He also established the Church of St. Mary in Alexandria, Virginia, and was its visiting pastor. Neale was briefly the acting president of Georgetown College, and later became its president in 1809. His tenure was considered unsuccessful, as the number of students declined dramatically due to his implementation of strict monastic discipline.
When the Jesuit order was restored in the United States in 1806, Neale joined the Society and became the master of novices at Georgetown. He was also made treasurer of the Jesuits' Maryland mission. He spent his later years as the spiritual director to the nuns at the Georgetown Visitation Monastery and the pastor at St. Thomas Manor.
Early life.
Francis Ignatius Neale was born on June 3, 1756, at Chandler's Hope, the Neale family estate near Port Tobacco, located in Charles County of the British Province of Maryland. He was born into a prominent Maryland family; among his ancestors was Captain James Neale, one of the settlers of the Maryland Colony, who arrived in 1637 upon receiving a royal grant of in what would become Port Tobacco.
Neale's parents, William Neale and Anne Neale (), had thirteen children, and all seven of the boys, including Francis, the youngest, were sent to the Colleges of St Omer, Bruges, and Liège. Two of Francis Neale's brothers died during their studies, and four of the surviving five became Catholic priests. One brother, Leonard, would go on to become president of Georgetown College and the Archbishop of Baltimore, and another, Charles, also became a prominent Jesuit. One sister, Anne, entered the Order of Poor Clares as a nun, in Aire-sur-la-Lys, France. William Matthews, Neale's nephew through his sister Mary, was another future president of Georgetown.
In 1773, Pope Clement XIV ordered the worldwide suppression of the Society of Jesus. This meant Neale was unable to enter the Jesuit order as he intended, but he continued his seminary studies at the college in Liège. Following his ordination as a priest on April 3, 1788, he immediately left for the United States.
Maryland missions.
In 1789, John Carroll, the Bishop of Baltimore, founded the long-planned Georgetown College in the District of Columbia, the first Catholic institution of higher education in the United States. As early as 1785, Carroll had requested that Charles Plowden return a cohort of Maryland Jesuits studying at the college in Liège to the United States so that they could staff the fledging college. He intended Neale, in particular, to play a significant role in the college's early years. Carroll's requests went unfulfilled until November 1788, when Neale, having completed his studies at Liège, arrived in Baltimore. Carroll initially assigned Neale to the Jesuit estate of St. Thomas Manor, near Port Tobacco.
Neale enjoyed the rural life, and aligned with those Jesuits stationed at the Jesuits' rural Maryland manors who opposed Carroll's establishment of a college. He frequently expressed in correspondence with Carroll his belief that the Jesuits should direct their efforts to ministering to rural congregations in Southern Maryland, rather than on higher education. Neale's relationship with Carroll soured when Neale accused his superior of giving insufficient support to the rural missions, and Carroll chastised Neale for poorly managing his congregation's finances, such as failing to obtain orders for the new American-printed Douay–Rheims Bible. Eventually, Neale became the most outspoken opponent of Carroll's efforts to establish Georgetown College, which he believed to be at the expense of the Maryland Jesuits' rural manors.
Establishment of Georgetown Chapel.
In 1790, the governor of Maryland, Thomas Sim Lee, requested that a priest be sent to the rapidly expanding city of Frederick. Carroll sought to transfer Neale to Frederick from St. Thomas Manor, but Neale fell ill at about that time and was unable to go. Later that year, Carroll appointed Neale as the first pastor of the yet-to-be-built Georgetown Chapel, reasoning that Neale's prominent ancestry and acquaintance with many distinguished families in Georgetown would aid him in raising funds to support the nascent church. Neale did not arrive in Georgetown until January 13, 1792, after recovering from his period of ill health.
Neale proved to be a successful pastor of the church. He succeeded in raising considerable funds from Catholics in Montgomery, Prince George's, Charles, and St. Mary's counties in Maryland during the first several months of his tenure. This allowed construction on the chapel to begin quickly, and its foundation was complete by the end of 1792; the superstructure was completed the following year. As the new church occupied the entire width of its lot, Neale sought to protect it and its adjacent cemetery from encroachment by purchasing land on either side as a buffer. Contributions proved to be inadequate, and he resorted to supplementing donations with his own funds. He would again contribute his own money fifteen years later to purchase the remainder of the block's width, where the Holy Trinity School now stands. Construction on the Georgetown Chapel was complete by March 1794.
As the first Catholic church in the District of Columbia, the Georgetown Chapel drew parishioners from as far as Dumfries and Great Falls in Virginia and Bladensburg in Maryland. The size of the congregation increased rapidly, and the church soon became overcrowded, despite the erection of makeshift sheds on the sides of the church to augment the size of the building. In 1796, the parish established a mission church in Alexandria, which was the first Catholic church in the state of Virginia. Neale ministered to this church, but its location was considered too remote, so he purchased a former Methodist meeting house more centrally located in Alexandria, and named it the Church of St. Mary.
Relations between Neale and Carroll continued to deteriorate, as Neale resisted Carroll's attempts to sell some of the Jesuits' rural properties. In April 1797, Carroll directed Neale to transfer from Georgetown to the Jesuit's White Marsh Manor, as had been tentatively discussed at a previous meeting of the clergy, despite Neale's opposition. Before this order could be given effect, several wealthy parishioners and lay trustees of the Georgetown Chapel intervened to petition Carroll to keep Neale at Georgetown; Carroll acquiesced, and Neale remained as pastor until 1817, when he was succeeded by Benedict Joseph Fenwick.
In the meantime, Neale had become a prominent member of the Select Body of Clergy of the Corporation of Roman Catholic Clergymen of Maryland, a civil corporation beyond Carroll's authority composed of priests who had been Jesuits before the order's suppression. Neale was made the legal agent of the corporation in 1798.
Georgetown College.
In addition to his priestly duties at the Georgetown Chapel, Neale also worked at Georgetown College as treasurer "pro tempore", which was his sole source of income, room and board. In August 1797, a special committee of Maryland clergy was drawn up to determine the future of the college. It resolved that the institution was to be run by a five-member board of directors, composed of Maryland clergy who were selected from and by their peers. The effect of this resolution was to deprive Carroll and the incumbent Sulpician president of the college, Louis William DuBourg, of any official control of the school. Neale was selected as one of the five directors. At the board's first meeting in October 1797, Neale was elected vice president of the college, whose duties largely corresponded to those of his existing role of treasurer. He would hold the position of vice president for ten years.
When the president of Georgetown College, Robert Molyneux, was forced to resign the presidency due to declining health in December 1808, Neale was made the acting president, until a permanent successor could be found in his nephew, William Matthews, in March 1809. Following the end of Matthews' tenure, Neale succeeded him as president on November 1, 1809. He instituted the same severe monastic discipline that his brother, Leonard, had previously implemented at the college during his presidency. Students were required to follow a daily regimen, which heavily focussed on religious activities. Although this resulted in a considerable number of students entering the priesthood, it led to a significant decrease in the number of non-Catholic students and a severe decline in the overall number of students. Enrollment was also affected by competition for students with St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore. At the college, Neale established the first Sodality of the Blessed Virgin in the United States. He also purchased to expand the campus for student recreation.
Neale had little interest in managing the academic affairs of the college, and upon assuming the presidency, transferred responsibility for the school's academics to the vice president. As he simultaneously held other pastoral and administrative positions, he was largely absent from the college. Carroll's evaluation was that the college had "sunk to the lowest degree of discredit." Neale's tenure came to an end in August 1812, and Giovanni Antonio Grassi was named as his successor.
Involvement in the restored Jesuits.
In response to the request of Emperor Paul I of Russia, Pope Pius VII issued a bull in 1801 partially lifting the 1773 order of suppression by permitting the Jesuits to officially resume operation in the Russian Empire (which they had been already doing unofficially). Bishop Carroll had long sought to restore the Jesuit order in the United States, and aimed to do so by submitting the Maryland Jesuits to the jurisdiction of the Jesuits' Russian province. He was wary that such an arrangement would contravene the pope's order and might draw the attention of political enemies of the Jesuits. Neale and his brother, Charles, led a group of clergy in persistently urging Carroll to effectuate the arrangement. Carroll was eventually persuaded, and a Jesuit novitiate was formally opened on October 10, 1806, in a house offered for use by Neale, across the street from the now-Holy Trinity Church.
The newly appointed superior of the Maryland Jesuits, Robert Molyneux, named Neale as the master of novices. His selection drew some criticism from the European Jesuits sent at Carroll's request to aid the re-establishment of the Jesuits in the United States, on the grounds that Neale had never been trained in a Jesuit novitiate, and that he would simultaneously be a novice himself. As well as serving as master of novices, Neale assumed the role of treasurer of the Jesuit's Maryland mission. During the War of 1812, Neale had most of the Jesuits' livestock in St. Inigoes removed to White Marsh, to keep them safe from looting by the British.
Later life.
Upon the death of his brother Leonard in 1817, Neale assumed his duties as spiritual director to the nuns of the Georgetown Visitation Monastery. He suffered a stroke while in Alexandria. Though this necessitated that he relinquish the full-time position, he continued to hear the nuns' confessions until his death. After his recovery, he once again took up missionary work in rural Maryland. He returned to St. Thomas Manor, where he became pastor of its church, later known as St. Ignatius Church. He served in this office from 1819 until 1837. Neale died on December 20, 1837, and he was buried in the cemetery at St. Thomas Manor.

The Coup (The Office)

"The Coup" is the third episode of the third season of the American comedy television series "The Office" and the show's thirty-first episode overall. It first aired on October 5, 2006, on NBC in the United States.
The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) becomes unimpressed with how Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is controlling his branch, so Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) tries to take his job and an office power play ensues. Meanwhile, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) conducts a lunchtime fashion show, and the Stamford branch plays "Call of Duty" as a team-building exercise, something Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) does not do well in.
The episode was written by co-executive producer Paul Lieberstein and directed by executive producer Greg Daniels. Several cast members noted that the episode contained Shakespearean elements, such as Angela Martin's similarities with the "Macbeth" character Lady Macbeth. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was viewed by 4.1% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. Critical reception was largely mixed, with several reviewers criticizing Jim's Stamford storyline.
Plot.
Jan Levinson berates Michael Scott when she discovers that he calls the entire office into the conference room every Monday to watch a movie. Angela Martin prods Dwight Schrute to ask Jan to give him Michael's job. After her awkward meeting with Dwight, where he declares he can be a better boss than Michael, Jan calls Michael and demands he get his branch under control.
The Stamford branch plays "Call of Duty" under the guise of a team-building exercise. New to the game, Jim Halpert plays poorly and draws the ire of his teammates. As he leaves for home, Jim pretends to toss a grenade at Karen Filippelli, who responds by creating a pretend explosion with paper clips. Karen longingly watches Jim leave.
Meanwhile, Pam Beesly decides to revamp her wardrobe after her separation from Roy Anderson and ordered some new clothes. When Pam's clothes are shipped to the office, Kelly Kapoor insists that Pam perform a lunchtime fashion show to show off a new blouse. When it draws unwanted attention, Pam concludes that it is too revealing.
Michael leads Dwight to believe that he has been given control of the branch before revealing the ruse. Dwight begs for his job and for Michael's forgiveness while Angela and the rest of the office watch. Dwight offers to do Michael's laundry for a year. When it appears that Michael is on the verge of firing Dwight, Michael insists that they "hug it out, bitch." Dwight quickly returns to being Michael's loyal right-hand man, but Michael is still resentful, and forces Dwight to stand atop a box in the middle of the office, wearing a sign that says "LIAR"—and then promise to do Michael's laundry for a year.
Production.
"The Coup" was written by co-executive producer Paul Lieberstein, who plays series regular Toby Flenderson, and was directed by executive producer and series creator Greg Daniels. Several cast members believed the episode contains Shakespearean themes, in particular elements of the "Macbeth" character Lady Macbeth in Angela's storyline. Lady Macbeth was depicted as an ambitious woman who "exerted an evil influence over her husband," characteristics that fit with Angela attempting to push her lover, Dwight, into power. In her weekly blog for "TV Guide", actress Kate Flannery previewed the episode, "Behind every great man is a pushy woman. Or in this case, a pushy, short, judgmental blonde named Angela. It's the ultimate Adam-and-Eve saga. Angela is about to push the apple in Dwight's face as she persuades him to try to take Michael's place at Dunder Mifflin."
In preparation for some episode scenes, Rashida Jones "took some serious "Call of Duty"" lessons from the writers, as they all played the online game. In the DVD audio commentary, Rainn Wilson stated that he was happy that the series could "have the nuanced stuff and then the really broad stuff"; he referred specifically to Michael confronting Dwight in this episode as well as to the season's twenty-third episode "Beach Games", where "people are running around in inflatable outfits bashing each other." Also in the audio commentary, Jones suggested that Dwight's punishment – being forced to wear a "liar" sign and stand silently on some boxes in the middle of the office – was reminiscent of the iconic photo of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse.
The season three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes that were edited from the episode. These include Creed revealing that he sleeps under his desk four nights a week, Dwight and Angela flirting in the break room after he tries to persuade her to join Movie Monday, Dwight responding to Angela's initial suggestions that he should push Michael out by saying "Michael has the best sales figures in the company's history—I'll never come close to his numbers", Michael becoming suspicious when Pam interrupts to tell him that he has a phone call, Pam responding to Kevin's unwanted attention to her neckline, and Creed reacting to having Dwight as the new boss.
Reception.
"The Coup" first aired on October 5, 2006, in the United States on NBC. It received a Nielsen rating of 4.1/11. This means that it was seen by 4.1% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode placed as the 24th most-watched episode for the week in that demographic.
The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. IGN columnist Brian Zoromski rated "The Coup" 7.8/10, indicating it as a "good" episode. He felt that after the "brilliant" episode from the previous week, "The Coup" was "somewhat anticlimactic, as Jim doesn't interact at all with the Scranton branch and the Pam-Jim storyline is pretty much ignored." Despite his disappointment with Jim's storyline, Zoromski commented that the "best moments of the episode were the completely random ones, such as Dwight knowing that Jan wears blouses from Liz Claiborne and earrings from Ann Taylor." AOLTV's Michael Sciannamea was also unhappy with Jim's scenes, writing that they were "beginning to grate on [him]. Is every branch office at Dunder Mifflin filled with crazies? How then does the company stay in business? I think it would have been funnier if Jim ended up in an office where it's nothing but work and no play at all. The "Call of Duty" bits didn't do much for me."
Kath Skerry of Give Me My Remote called Dwight's groveling "hilarious," but was unsure about Jim and Karen's ending scene, explaining that it "was adorable. Too adorable. And I’m not quite ready to handle the fact that I’m not HATING the idea of Jim and Karen. I feel like I’m betraying Pam. I’m still a JAM shipper all the way, but it’s nice to see Jim smile again." Skerry concluded that "there were some seriously funny, laugh out loud moments tonight, but I don’t think this episode is going to make my favorites list. But even when "The Office" isn’t at its best, it’s still hands down the best comedy on TV." Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A−. In the audio commentary, Wilson noted that "The Coup" is "not a fan favorite," though it was submitted for an Emmy Award. For his work on this episode, Paul Lieberstein was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Comedy.

Stupid Invaders

Stupid Invaders is an adventure video game developed by Xilam and published by Ubi Soft for Microsoft Windows in 2000 and Mac OS in 2001. A 2001 Dreamcast port was handled by Titanium Studios. The game is based on the animated television series, "Space Goofs".
The game was dedicated to Jean-Yves Raimbaud, the co-creator of the TV series, who died before the game was released. Unlike the original show, the game is also reliant on toilet humor and is slightly more adult in nature, making it the first work produced by Xilam to be for an older audience, before "", "Mr. Baby", and then "I Lost My Body", which was released decades later.
Most of the staff members from the first season of the original series were involved with the game's production. The original cast reprised their roles as the main aliens, some of whom provide dialogue for some exclusive characters. The game features the additional voices of Billy West, Rob Paulsen and Laraine Newman, with Danny Mann (Gorgious) voicing an evil scientist from "Zero Stuff" and West voicing the antagonist, Bolok from "The Pro".
Plot.
The plot centers around the aliens and their attempts to return to space. However, a bounty hunter, the stoic yet serious Bolok, is sent by an evil scientist, to target the aliens. Thus, Etno's attempt to explain his newest idea goes awry as the aliens are frozen solid by Bolok's gun – which forces Bud to retreat to the bathroom. Once he sneaks to the rooftop and sneaks around the house, the player progresses through the large, surreal world within performing very specific (and often absurd) actions, like melting Santa Claus and reducing him into green ooze.
Gameplay.
All the main characters of the series are playable through the course of the game. The game rejects or distorts some clichéd aspects of the adventure genre, as standard adventure game tactics such as picking up, talking to, or interacting with anything encountered can often result in instant (albeit highly comical) death for the player's currently-controlled character and the need to reload, for example, often without warning. The game does not support autosaving – players need to save manually before they progress any further.
Reception.
The game received "mixed" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Daniel Erickson of "NextGen" said that the PC version "would have been better as a non-interactive cartoon."
