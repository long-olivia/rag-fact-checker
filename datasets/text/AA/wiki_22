Interstate 64 in West Virginia

Interstate 64 (I-64) is an Interstate Highway in the US state of West Virginia. It travels east–west through the state for passing by the major towns and cities of Huntington, Charleston, Beckley, and Lewisburg.
Route description.
I-64 travels for within the state of West Virginia, passing by the major cities of Huntington, Beckley, and Lewisburg and directly through the capital city of Charleston. It has only two major junctions within the state: I-77 in Charleston and in Beckley. It also crosses the Kanawha River a total of four times in a stretch (twice west of Charleston, immediately before entering the downtown Charleston area, then approximately east of downtown Charleston in Kanawha City).
Between I-64's two junctions with I-77, I-64 and I-77 overlap. From the final crossing of the Kanawha River east of Charleston to their split at exit 40 south of Beckley, the two Interstates are tolled, forming a part of the West Virginia Turnpike.
While the two expressways overlap, the exit signs are those for I-77. Thus, eastbound travelers entering from Kentucky will see exit numbers increase until exit 60, at which time I-77's exit numbers are used, decreasing from exit 100.
History.
Early beginnings.
The first segment of I-64 in West Virginia to be let to construction was in Cabell County in 1957. This segment, from US Route 60 (US 60) at milepost 15 to Ona at milepost 20, was completed in 1960.
In 1962, a lengthy segment from exit 28 at Milton to just west of exit 44 was opened to traffic. This included exits 34 and 39. One year later, I-64 was completed to exit 44, serving originally West Virginia Route 17 (WV 17), now WV 817 near St. Albans.
In 1964, an segment of the Interstate opened from exit 20 at Ona to exit 28 at Milton.
1965 saw the completion of a major part of I-64. A lengthy segment opened from the Kentucky state line (milepost 0) to exit 15 at Barboursville. This consisted of four interchanges: Kenova and Ceredo at milepost 1, the West Huntington Expressway (WV 94, later US 52) at milepost 6, US 52 and downtown Huntington (later WV 152/WV 527) at milepost 8, and Hal Greer Boulevard and WV 10 at milepost 10. Two steel-girder bridges were completed over the Big Sandy River connecting Kentucky to West Virginia. That bridge was replaced in 2000 in a reconstruction effort that raised the bridge level and replaced deteriorating bridge girders.
In 1966, the first Kanawha River crossing was completed with new Interstate mainlines extending from exit 44 near St. Albans to exit 50 at Institute under four contracts. This included three new interchanges: Nitro at milepost 45, Cross Lanes at milepost 47, and Institute at milepost 50. One year later, I-64 was extended eastward to Dunbar at milepost 52.4 with a new interchange constructed at that location. For six years, the Interstate would end just outside Charleston's borders.
Charleston's routing troubles.
Planning for the routing of I-64, as well as for I-77 and I-79 through Charleston, was embroiled in controversy since the 1950s. Several alignments were considered which included a northern arc around the Charleston metropolitan area, a downtown route, and a southern arc south of South Charleston.
The mayor at the time, John Shanklin, mayor for eight years from 1959 to 1967, was originally a strong opponent of any Interstate Highway going through the center of the city. Shanklin reversed his decision soon after and stated that Charleston can adjust to the impact and that it will eventually become a "great thing".
In 1971, the city and many residents were swimming in controversy over the proposed routes of the Interstate Highways. The long planned Interstates through West Virginia were either to run directly through the city center or to skirt it.
The plan was to bring I-64 through the Triangle District, just west of the downtown center, an urban blight, where many of the city's Black population lived. Home to the city's highest crime rates where shootings daily were common; it was referred to as the "Red Light District". Urban renewals in the past had failed. Residents living in the Triangle District formed committees and rebelled. They called the highway routing foolish because it wanted to make Charleston just another exit on an endless ribbon of concrete and that it was racist because the Black population would bear the brunt of the relocation.
Federal transportation secretary John A. Volpe stalled for months at the decision on the routing of I-64 through Charleston. By late 1971, however, the final decision was made to route the Interstate through the Triangle District. The Triangle Improvement Council fought the decision for the downtown routing and took its case to the US Supreme Court. They failed, however, as they had no basis for their case. Construction began in September 1971, cutting away parts of 14 mountains and demolishing over 1,000 homes on the south banks of the Kanawha River. WV 14 and other roads were relocated. The Fort Hill project, named so because of the mountain that lies near the massive US 119 interchange, became one of the largest earth-moving projects on the North American continent up to that point and one of the biggest changes that Charleston has ever known.
In 1971, construction began for the connection between the I-77/I-64 interchange at exit 101 (I-77 milepost 101.64) and exit 96 (milepost 95.87). In 1974, I-64 opened to traffic from milepost 52.4, east of exit 50 at Institute to exit 55 (milepost 55.45). This included the construction of an interchange at milepost 54 for US 60 and WV 601 and a second Kanawha River span. When the river crossing was completed, it was one of the largest steel girder bridges in the US at the time. Also, I-77/I-64 opened from exit 100 (milepost 100.16) to exit 99 (milepost 99.12).
In 1975, I-64 was completed to I-77 which included the US 119 Fort Hill interchange (exit 58A) at milepost 57.48. This segment also involved the construction of the third Kanawha River span, exits 58B and 58C and the I-77 junction at milepost 58.78. This three-level junction spans local streets and is the largest interchange in West Virginia with piers embedded in buildings, over water, and over nearby streets. This also included the viaduct over the Triangle District.
In 1976, I-77/I-64 opened from exit 96 (milepost 95.87) to the northern terminus of the West Virginia Turnpike at milepost 99.12 (exit 99). The Interstate concurrency was opened to traffic from exit 100 (milepost 100.16) to exit 101 (milepost 101.64). This completed the last segment of Interstate within Charleston city limits.
Charleston east to Virginia.
The alignment of I-64 was to originally parallel US 60 from Charleston to the Virginia state line. This would go through environmentally sensitive areas such as Hawks Nest and the New River Gorge area and might have disrupted the natural beauty and the isolation of the area.
 In 1969, Governor Arch A. Moore Jr. announced a delay in the construction of I-64 east of Charleston. He concluded that a study needed to be done on whether the highway should run parallel to US 60 east of Charleston. On March 28, 1974, Governor Moore concluded that I-64 would be routed from Sam Black Church almost due west to a junction with the West Virginia Turnpike (I-77) near Beckley, rather than following the US 60 alignment as initially proposed. From that point, I-64 was concurrent with the northern portion of an upgraded West Virginia Turnpike to reach the Charleston area. This section of I-64 is the only portion of the highway which is a toll road.
In 1971, I-64 was completed from WV 12 (milepost 161.46) to the Virginia state line at milepost 184.02. This included six interchanges: exit 161 for WV 12, exit 169 for US 219 and Lewisburg, exit 175 for US 60 for White Sulphur Springs, exit 181 for US 60 (westbound only), and exit 183 for WV 311 (eastbound only). It was extended westward to exit 156 (milepost 155.98) at Sam Black Church in 1973.
The final segment of I-64 to be completed was between Sam Black Church and the West Virginia Turnpike near Beckley. This revised Interstate alignment traverses through an entirely rural area with extremely rugged terrain. Opened in 1988, this final portion is long and cost approximately $300 million (equivalent to $ in ) to construct, making it one of the most expensive segments of Interstate Highway in the US at $7.8 million per mile (/km; equivalent to $ per mile [/km] in ). It has some extremely rugged terrain, with one segment boasting a seven-percent grade downhill eastbound for at Sandstone Mountain. Anticipating loss of braking situations, two emergency truck escape ramps were built to be used by runaway trucks. These emergency ramps were used with such frequency that, in addition to large warning signs alerting truckers to the steep grade, a special truck speed advisory system was installed to automatically weigh each truck and indicate the speed at which it should begin the downhill section.
Even with careful adherence to reduced speeds for truckers, the journey from Charleston to Lewisburg is far quicker and far safer on I-64 than the older routing via US 60, much of which winds through the mountains as the Midland Trail, a two-lane scenic byway, passing through hamlets such as Rainelle and Ansted.
Between mileposts 129 and 133, also in Raleigh County, is the Phil G. McDonald Bridge, also known as the Glade Creek Bridge, a deck truss bridge, towering above the creekbed.
The New River crossing is at milepost 137 on the Mary Draper Ingles Bridge, named after an American pioneer. The highway also traverses through a wildlife refuge and marsh near milepost 154.
Continuing improvements.
Continuing improvements and new interchanges were discussed throughout the 1990s and 2000s.
Exit 20, the main road to the Huntington Mall and its associated developments along with US 60, was originally constructed as a diamond interchange that served Ona and US 60. The land surrounding the interchange was entirely rural and would not be developed until 1981 when Huntington Mall was completed. The diamond interchange configuration was reconstructed into a five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange. Exit 20A served US 60 while exit 20B was for Huntington Mall. By 2001, development consumed both sides of the Interstate. On holiday shopping days, traffic would congest at the interchange and cause major backups on the Interstate. In 2001, the West Virginia Department of Transportation (WVDOT) constructed a new ramp, exit 20A, that would serve US 60 and the west end of Huntington Mall. The original exit 20A ramp was removed. Exit 20B was kept, for the most part, in its current position with a left turn lane added that allowed it to serve the east end of Huntington Mall, Melody Farm Road, and US 60. In the same year, a new interchange opened for WV 193 (Merritts Creek Connector) at Barboursville. Exit 18 serves a new four-lane highway that links US 60 and WV 2 together.
In 2002, cable barriers were installed in the median from milepost 6 to milepost 15 as a stopgap measure. These new barriers, installed for $2 million (equivalent to $ in ), required the regrading of the median and upgrades to the drainage system. These new protective devices have proved to be worthwhile, preventing many crossover accidents which have plagued the highway since the 1990s, mostly attributed to an increase in traffic on the overburdened Interstate Highway. This cable barrier system was extended to exit 28 at Milton in 2005, and future measures will ensure that the rest of the Interstate Highway system in West Virginia, where a depressed grassy median of similar width exists, will receive one.
Aging roadbeds and bridges are of large concern to the WVDOT. Many Interstate Highway spans are approaching the end of their useful life span, several nearing 40 years of age. One such span was in the Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area which showed significant signs of deterioration. The WV 10/Hale Greer Boulevard crossings were approaching 40 years of life and decayed to the point where regular maintenance was needed. A segment of the westbound bridge collapsed in early 2002 after a harsh winter, for example, and this only highlighted the problems being experienced on the original I-64 spans. The two spans at WV 10 were replaced with a new wider crossing in 2009.
In 2003, the demolition of the West Pea Ridge Road overpass began. The bridge, built in 1961, utilized steel girders that had become deteriorated over the years and were replaced with prestressed concrete beams. Construction was completed in late 2004.
The second Kanawha River crossing between Dunbar and South Charleston was twinned. The new bridge, carrying eastbound traffic, was finished in October 2010. The old bridge was rehabilitated and converted to oneway traffic, with completion in October 2012. The combined bridges carry six throughlanes, three in each direction, with two auxiliary lanes to service the Dunbar and MacCorkle avenue exits on each side of the bridge. The mainspan of the new eastbound structure, at , is the longest box girder span in the US. With the completion of the new eastbound bridge and the rehabilitation of the existing bridge for westbound traffic, I-64 has at least six lanes from Charleston to Nitro.
, the third Kanawha River crossing at Nitro is currently under reconstruction in a project very similar to the South Charleston expansion. The Nitro crossing will be twinned, with the new bridge carrying westbound traffic. The existing bridge will be demolished and rebuilt to carry eastbound traffic. The combined spans will carry six throughlanes, three in each direction, with two auxiliary lanes servicing the Nitro and St. Albans exits on each side of the bridge. The project will also include new bridges over Rocky Step Road and McCloud Road and result in six throughlanes (three in each direction) from Charleston to the interchange with US 35. Construction is scheduled to be completed in 2023.
Other notable recent projects:
The state's long-term construction forecast, for a six-lane Interstate from milepost 6 at West Huntington to Charleston and bridge replacements west of milepost 6 to the Kentucky state line, will take 30 years to complete at present funding levels and cost more than $325 million.
Naming.
The portion from the Charleston city limits to the Kentucky state line is signed as the "Cecil H. Underwood Freeway", named after the 25th and 32nd governor of West Virginia. The portion in the city limits of Charleston is signed as the "Nurse Veterans Highway". The portion from the West Virginia Turnpike to the Virginia line is the Hulett Smith Freeway, named after the 27th governor of West Virginia.

Visual Interactive Voice Response

Visual Interactive Voice Response (Visual IVR) is conceptually similar to voice Interactive voice response (IVR). Visual IVR uses web applications to "instantly create an app-like experience for users on smartphones during contact center interactions without the need to download any app." The user interacts with a visual interface by touch or click commands on his mobile or computer screen. The technology can be used either on a mobile device app or directly over the web. Visual IVR can be used for companies to interact with their monthly customers, to provide electronic billing and to order other information through a single access point. The user can realize in a few clicks a selfcare journey to find his answer, use another channel made available by the company (email, chatbot, SMS …) or to be put in relation directly with the good skill. Visual IVR has shown advantages over its legacy IVR counterpart, including reducing the average time to resolution by 300 seconds per call, earning a Net Promoter Score of 91 for ease of use, and increasing call containment by 75%. It can overcome inherent challenges in mobile app adoption. Visual IVR can also utilize video as a part of its interface, sometimes referred to as Video IVR. The Interactive Display Response System, which is one form of Visual IVR, was patented in 2009.

Metatheatre

Metatheatre, and the closely related term metadrama, describes the aspects of a play that draw attention to its nature as drama or theatre, or to the circumstances of its performance. "Breaking the Fourth Wall" is an example of a metatheatrical device.
Metatheatrical devices may include: direct address to the audience (especially in soliloquies, asides, prologues, and epilogues); expression of an awareness of the presence of the audience (whether they are addressed directly or not); an acknowledgement of the fact that the people performing are actors (and not actually the characters they are playing); an element whose meaning depends on the difference between the represented time and place of the drama (the fictional world) and the time and place of its theatrical presentation (the reality of the theatre event); plays-within-plays (or masques, spectacles, or other forms of performance within the drama); references to acting, theatre, dramatic writing, spectatorship, and the frequently employed metaphor according to which "all the world's a stage" ("Theatrum mundi"); scenes involving eavesdropping or other situations in which one or several characters observe another or others, such that the former relate to the behaviour of the latter as if it were a staged performance for their benefit.
The words "metatheatre" and "metadrama" combine theatre or drama with the Greek prefix "meta—", which implies "a level beyond" the subject that it qualifies.
In the history of drama.
Greece and Rome.
Metatheatricality has been a dimension of drama ever since its invention in the theatre of classical Greece 2,500 years ago. One major purpose of this metatheatricality was to keep the spectators away from utter involvement or belief in the development of the plot presented. Ancient Greek comedy in particular made frequent use of it (though examples can also be found in tragedy, including in "The Bacchae" by Euripides).
Early modern theatre.
In early modern English theatre, characters often adopt a downstage position in close contact with the audience and comment on the actions of others sarcastically or critically, while the other actors assume the convention that the first remains unheard and unseen while so doing. Following the work of Robert Weimann and others, theatre studies uses the terms "locus" and "platea" (relating to "location" and "place", borrowed from medieval theatre) to describe this performance effect—the "locus" is localised within the drama such that its characters are absorbed in its fiction and unaware of the presence of the audience; while the "platea" is a neutral space in close contact with the spectators that exists on the boundary between the fiction and the audience's reality.
When the defeated Cleopatra, performed by a boy player in act five of Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra", fears her humiliation in the theatres of Rome in plays staged to ridicule her, she says: "And I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness in the posture of a whore". While the actor is not necessarily engaged at this point in the direct address of the audience, the reality of the male performer beneath the female character is openly, and comically, acknowledged (qualifying in important ways, supported further in the scene and the play as a whole, the tragic act of her imminent suicide). Metatheatricality of this kind is found in most plays of that period.
In "Hamlet", there occurs the following exchange between Hamlet and Polonius:
If the only significance of this exchange lay in its reference to characters within another play, it might be called a metadramatic (or "intertextual") moment. Within its original performance context, however, there is a more specific, metatheatrical reference. Historians assume that Hamlet and Polonius were played by the same actors who had played the roles mentioned in Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" a year or two earlier on the same stage. Apart from the dramatic linking of the character of Hamlet with the murderer Brutus (foreshadowing Hamlet's murder of Polonius later in the play), the audience's awareness of the identities of the actors and their previous roles is comically referenced.
Another example from Shakespeare is in Act V of "A Midsummer Night's Dream". The rude mechanicals present "Pyramus and Thisbe" to the Athenian nobles, who openly comment on the performance as it unfolds. The storyline of "Pyramus and Thisbe" closely parallels Lysander and Hermia's story, which suggests theirs could have ended tragically. Then Puck, who has broken the fourth wall multiple times to share asides with the audience, steps outside of the action of the play to address the audience directly. His final speech bids farewell to the audience members and asks them to think of the play as only a dream if it has offended. This relates to the way Bottom rationalizes his experience in the forest as only a dream. These metatheatrical layers suggest that we all inhabit the roles of observer and observed on the worldly stage and that it's possible to dismiss strange experiences as dreams.
Modern theatre.
The fourth wall.
In the modern era, the rise of realism and naturalism led to the development of a performance convention known as the "fourth wall". The metaphor suggests a relationship to the mise-en-scène behind a proscenium arch. When a scene is set indoors and three of the walls of its room are presented onstage, the "fourth" of them would run along the line dividing the room from the auditorium (technically called the "proscenium"). The fourth wall is thus an invisible, imagined wall that separates the actors from the audience. While the audience can see through this "wall", the convention assumes, the actors act as if they cannot. In this sense, the "fourth wall" is a convention of acting, rather than of set design. It can be created regardless of the presence of any actual walls in the set, or the physical arrangement of the theatre building or performance space, or the actors' distance from or proximity to the audience.
"Breaking the fourth wall" is any instance in which this performance convention, having been adopted more generally in the drama, is disregarded. The temporary suspension of the convention in this way draws attention to its use in the rest of the performance. This act of drawing attention to a play's performance conventions is metatheatrical.
A similar effect of metareference is achieved when the performance convention of avoiding direct contact with the camera, generally used by actors in a television drama or film, is temporarily suspended. The phrase "breaking the fourth wall" is used to describe such effects in those media.
Modernism.
Instances of metatheatricality "other" than "breaking the fourth wall" occur in plays by many of the realist playwrights, including Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, and Anton Chekhov. As with modernism more generally, metareference in the form of metatheatricality comes to play a far more central and significant role in the modernist theatre, particularly in the work of Bertolt Brecht, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Luigi Pirandello, Thornton Wilder, Samuel Beckett, and many others.
In more recent times, "With the People from the Bridge" by Dimitris Lyacos employs metatheatrical techniques whereby a makeshift play centered on the vampire legend is viewed from the angle of a spectator who records in his diary the setting and preparations as well as the sequence of the actors' soliloquies interspersed with personal notes on the development of the performance.
In contemporary China, avant-garde theatre director Meng Jinghui (b. 1964) employs metatheatre as his central trope. In particular, “play within the play” was used in many of his early works (such as Waiting for Godot and The Balcony) in the aftermath of the Tiananmen protests to express disillusionment with revolutionary ideals and disbelief in politics. “Role playing within the role” was used in many of his later plays (such as I Love XXX and Rhinoceros in Love) to enact the split identities of young people in contemporary China who are caught between idealism from China’s socialist past and cynicism in its capitalist present.
Origin of the term.
The term "metatheatre" was coined by Lionel Abel in 1963 and has since entered common critical usage. Abel described metatheatre as reflecting comedy and tragedy, at the same time, where the audience can laugh at the protagonist while feeling empathetic simultaneously. Abel relates it to the character of Don Quixote, whom he considers to be the prototypical, metatheatrical, self-referring character. Don Quixote looks for situations of which he wants to be a part, not waiting for life to oblige, but replacing reality with imagination when the world is lacking in his desires. The character is aware of his own theatricality. Khalil-Ghibran's cross breeds the term with the Greek prefix as before, but the poetic undertones covey the familiar feeling of awareness.

The Lost Stradivarius

The Lost Stradivarius (1895), by J. Meade Falkner, is a short horror novel about ghosts and the evil that can be invested in an object, in this case an extremely fine Stradivarius violin. It has been described as "one of Falkner's three celebrated novels" and as a "psychic romance".
Plot.
After finding the violin of the title in a hidden compartment in his college rooms, the protagonist, a wealthy young heir, becomes increasingly secretive as well as obsessed by a particular piece of music, which seems to have the power to call up the ghost of the violin's previous owner. Roaming from England to Italy, the story involves family love, lordly depravity, and the tragedy of obsession, all conveyed in a "high" serious tone not uncommon in late Victorian literature. Preceding ghost stories by several years, it has been called the novel James might have written, had he written novels.
Broadcast.
This story was adapted as the first episode of the ATV-produced ITV horror anthology series "Mystery and Imagination", broadcast on 29 January 1966. All known copies of the episode were wiped or destroyed, and only a complete low-quality audio recording is known to exist.
In August 2008, a Joanna David reading of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 7.

I Wish (Carl Thomas song)

"I Wish" is a song by American R&amp;B singer Carl Thomas, released by Arista and Bad Boy Records on February 15, 2000 as the second single from his debut album "Emotional". It was co-written by Thomas and Mike City, while production was handled by the latter. The song peaked at number 20 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 and spent six weeks atop the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
Background.
"I Wish" was written by Thomas along with the song's producer, Mike City. Thomas also served as a co-producer on the track. Lyrically, "I Wish" describes a narrator who finds himself in a "situationship." According to producer Mike City, the song was written based on a personal story of his. Several connections led City's demo of the song to be discovered by Sean "P. Diddy" Combs. After City rearranged the song for Carl Thomas, he claims to have been kicked out of Combs' recording studio. 
Music video.
A music video for "I Wish" was directed by Marcus Raboy and filmed in New York City.
Remixes.
The official remix of "I Wish" features guest appearances from Bad Boy Records label boss P. Diddy and LL Cool J, while another remix that features Prodigy and Shyne. A "megamix" compiled by DJ Clue features all three performers.

Commonweal School

The Commonweal School is a secondary school and sixth form (also referred to as Commonweal Sixth or simply C6) in the Old Town area of Swindon, Wiltshire, England.
History.
The Commonweal School was opened as a grammar school in 1927, and most of the first pupils transferred from the College and Euclid Street secondary schools. The original building was designed for 410 pupils. September 1939 saw a sudden rise in numbers to 530 as evacuees arrived, half of them from East Ham Grammar School, London.
In 1965, it became a Senior High School, taking pupils of all abilities aged 14 to 18. There was another re-organisation in 1983 when Commonweal became a seven-form entry comprehensive school for pupils aged 11 to 16, therefore losing its sixth form.
Its academy status was awarded on 1 August 2011; previously, it had been a foundation school. An expansion in September 2014 saw the reinstatement of its sixth form, known as C6.
Leadership.
'Tam' Hartley was the school's first headmaster. Doctor C.E Jones was appointed headmaster in 1932, and his name is commemorated in the shield awarded to the house that wins the annual Sports Day. Keith Defter become headmaster in 1998. Robert Linnegar, formerly deputy headmaster, took over in September 2017 and retired at the end of August 2021. Charles 'Chas' Drew was appointed to the post in September 2021. James Matcham is currently the Head of Sixth form, a role he has held since sixth form's reinstatement in 2014.
Commonweal Sixth Form.
In December 2012, it was announced by head teacher Keith Defter that the Department for Education had accepted the school's bid for a sixth form. This opened in September 2014 with places for up to 300 students in new, purpose-built facilities such as a café, rehearsal rooms, recording studio, an editing suite and a 150-seat auditorium, funded by the Department for Education. The sixth form provides a range of academic courses, alongside a varied enrichment programme.
Academic performance.
At the most recent Ofsted inspection, in November 2017, the school received a rating of 'Good' in all categories, leading to an overall effectiveness rating of 'Good'.

Monroe Street Bridge (Spokane, Washington)

The Monroe Street Bridge is a deck arch bridge in the northwestern United States that spans the Spokane River in Spokane, Washington. It was built in 1911 by the city of Spokane, and was designed by city engineer John Chester Ralston, assisted in construction supervision by Morton Macartney (and by assistant engineers J. F. Greene and P.F. Kennedy) with ornamentation provided by the firm of Kirtland Kelsey Cutter and Karl G. Malmgren as part of Cutter &amp; Malmgren.
At completion, it was the largest concrete arch bridge in the U.S. and the third longest in the world. After more than ninety years of service, it was closed in January 2003 for restoration and reopened in September 2005.
History.
The current bridge of 1911 is the third in this location. The first, a rather rickety wooden structure, was built in 1889. It was closed for a time due to arguments in the city over rights of passage and ownership, and burned down on July 22, 1890. The second was a steel bridge that opened June 27, 1892. It vibrated badly and had a noticeable dip in the center. On August 28, 1905, consultant from the Good Roads Movement considered the bridge unsafe.
The design of the third bridge was largely copied from the Rocky River Bridge in Cleveland, Ohio, but was built one foot (0.3 m) longer to make it the largest concrete arch in the U.S. at the time. In turn, the Rocky River Bridge was modeled after the Walnut Lane Bridge in Philadelphia, which was modeled after the Adolphe Bridge in Luxembourg.
The Monroe Street bridge was designed with ornamental features such as bison skulls, covered pavilions, and a chain-link railing motif. The bison skull was an inspiration of P. C. Shine, who had found it in Alberta at Drumheller in the early 1900s. Located just west of the Falls, the bridge runs due north–south and opened on November 23, 1911.
20th century modernization.
The bridge underwent changes in 1925 and in 1934, and submitted to the modernization of Spokane. The pavilion lamps were converted to electric lighting in 1925, and the electric car railways were removed from the bridge in 1934. Approaching 65 years of service in 1976, the bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
21st century restoration.
By the 1990s, the bridge had deteriorated to the point where rebuilding it was necessary. On January 6, 2003, the bridge was closed for restoration, dismantled down to the central arch, and rebuilt faithfully to its original appearance. The bridge was reopened in 2005 on September 17, with new railings and concrete separating the walkways from the road.
Suicides.
The Monroe Street Bridge has a local reputation as being a suicide bridge. According to the Spokane County Medical Examiners Office, from 2006 to 2018 there was an average of 2.4 deaths per year on the bridge and nine out of 13 witnessed or videotaped incidents of bridge jumper suicides on the Spokane River were on the Monroe Street Bridge. With a bridge height from the deck floor to water of 135 feet and accounting for the air resistance drag on the human body in the 1.5 second free fall, the impact velocity at the waters surface is approximately 57.2 miles per hour which almost always causes traumatic injuries and jumpers either die of their injuries, drowning, hypothermia or a combination of these. The Spokane Police Department receives an average of 20 calls about suicidal individuals a year on the Monroe Street Bridge and despite this, there is currently (as of August 2020) no formal measures in place to try to discourage or prevent people from jumping off the bridge. The city created a Suicide Prevention Task Force in 2018 and has discussed installing safety barriers, a telephone that connects to a suicide prevention hotline on the bridge, and patrolling the bridge. Although they are often removed, members of the community sometimes place suicide prevention signage and messages of hope on the deck fence railings to make people think again about their actions and dissuade potential jumpers. Concerned citizens have petitioned local officials for permanent signage.

Air Force Times is a newspaper published 26 times per year to provide active, reserve and retired United States Air Force and Air National Guard personnel and their families with news, information, analysis, community and lifestyle features, educational supplements, and resource guides. It is published by the Sightline Media Group, which is a part of Regent.
The publication was founded in 1947 by the Army Times Publishing Company, later called the Times Journal Company. Some years after ATPCO was sold to Gannett in 1997, the company was renamed Gannett Government Media. In 2015, the company was spun off into one of the digital properties of TEGNA, Inc. and renamed Sightline Media Group. In March 2016, TEGNA sold Sightline to Regent, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm controlled by investor Michael Reinstein.
Each year, "Air Force Times" names an Airman of the Year, nominated by his peers and honored at a ceremony on Capitol Hill, in Washington, D.C.
History.
"Air Force Times" was founded by Mel Ryder, who began his newspaper career during World War I, selling and delivering "Stars and Stripes" to troops on the front lines. In 1921, Ryder joined Willard Kiplinger in forming the Kiplinger Agency newsletter service. He sold his interest in the agency in 1933 and began publishing "Happy Days", a paper written for members of the Civilian Conservation Corps; his first order was for 400 copies and the first advertiser was GEICO. In the 1940s, Ryder founded "Army Times", with reporters covering the U.S. Army Air Corps and U.S. Army Air Forces. With the creation of the U.S. Air Force in 1947 came the birth of "Air Force Times" as a separate newspaper.
Subscriptions and readership.
As of 2007, according to Military Times figures, one in four subscribers was a member of the active-duty Air Force, while nearly one in 10 subscribers was a member of the Air Force Reserve. Weekly newsstand buyers totaled some 11,600, with 79 percent of newsstand sales to members of the active-duty Air Force and 9 percent to members of the Air Force Reserve.
In 2009, weekly subscribers totaled 43,800, with a total readership about one-third larger.

The Troubles in Maghera

During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, a total of 14 people were killed in Troubles-related violence in or near the village of Maghera, County Londonderry. Of the 13 from Northern Ireland, 11 were Protestant and two were Catholic. Seven of the Protestant victims were members of the security forces (six Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), two Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), one British Army) and another was the ten-year-old daughter of a UDR man, killed along with her father by a bomb planted in his car. Another victim was shot after being mistaken for his co-worker, an UDR member. Only three of the security force victims were killed while on-duty. Both the RUC men were killed by the Irish National Liberation Army; all the other Protestant victims were killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Both the Catholic victims were killed by loyalist paramilitaries, one by the Ulster Volunteer Force and one by the Loyalist Volunteer Force. One was a Sinn Féin councillor.

State Highway 104 (SH 104) is a proposed state highway which will run between Farm to Market Road 106 (FM 106) and Park Road 100 (PR 100) in South Padre Island in Cameron County, Texas, United States.
History.
Former routes.
A previous route numbered SH 104 was designated on May 25, 1925, as a connector route from Ranger to Morton Valley. On March 28, 1927, this was renumbered to SH 103, as old SH 103 was conditional.
Instead, SH 101, a connector route from Georgetown east to SH 95 at Circleville, was renumbered to SH 104 to avoid duplication with another SH 101. On May 28, 1932, the route was extended west to reach Liberty Hill, and it was completed by 1936. The highway was transferred to SH 29 on August 22, 1951, when it was extended after being supplanted by US Highway 183 on May 23, 1951.
Current route.
SH 104 was designated on December 12, 2023, on its proposed route.

Ascocerida

The Ascocerida are comparatively small, bizarre Orthoceratoids known only from Ordovician and Silurian sediments in Europe and North America, uniquely characterized by a deciduous conch consisting of a longer juvenile portion and an inflated short adult portion that separate sometime in maturity.
Morphology.
The juvenile portion of an ascocerid consists typically of a narrow, circular cyrtocone that underwent periodic truncation. Cumulative length, including broken off segments, may have reached about in the largest individuals. The siphuncle is located halfway between the shell axis and the venter, is thin walled and tubular with short, orthochoanitic septal necks and segments that are only slightly inflated. The juvenile portion is known as the deciduous conch, as it is shed in a similar manner to deciduous trees losing their leaves.
The adult, or mature ascoceroid conch, as it is referred to, typically consists of an expanded exogastric brevicone with unique features. The apical end is formed by the septum of truncation which is about three times as thick as normal internal septa and about as thick as the external shell itself. The septa become confined to the dorsal side of the shell resulting in a series of dorsal chambers, or camerae, that provided stabilizing buoyancy.
The ascocerid shell, or conch, is the thinnest and most fragile of any orthocone or cyrtocone of comparable size, which accounts for their rarity. Often it is only the mature, ascoceroid portion that is found.
Derivation and phylogeny.
The Ascocerida are derived from the michelinocerid family Clinocertidae in the early Middle Ordovician, possibly from "Clinoceras" through such slender forms as "Montyoceras" and "Hebetoceras". The connection between these slender deciduous forms and the typically ascoceroid "Probillingsites" from the early Upper Ordovician can be made through the slightly inflated "Redpathoceras".
A phylogenetic sequence can be seen in the Ascoceratidae, from "Probillingsites" through "Schucertoceras", then "Billingsites", in the Upper Ordovician, and finally to the middle and upper Silurian "Ascoceras". Changes involve the arrangement and complexity of septa in the mature conch and in its shape, ending with the more elongate and compressed mature "Ascoceras".
The Choanoceratidae is established for the derived Upper Silurian "Choanoceras", characterized by septa that form deep symmetrical cones and a subcentral expanded siphuncle with cyrtochoanitic and recumbent septal necks at maturity. The middle and possible upper Ordovician ancestral forms are placed in the Hebetoceratidae, which includes the orthoconic "Hebetoceras" and cyrtoconic "Montyoceras".
Paleoecology.
The fully mature breviconic ascocerid, with the juvenile longiconic portion discarded was no doubt a facile swimmer. The dorsal chambers would have provided a stable center of buoyancy directly above the center of gravity with the shell in a horizontal orientation. The hyponomic sinus, observed in some, indicates active, directionally controlled hydro-jet propulsion. Just how maneuverable these creatures were is another matter as is how high in the water column they spent their time.
How juvenile forms spent their time is less obvious. Juvenile shells are found in the same location as adult, indicating they lived in the same area. Juvenile ascocerids were probably more benthic than their adult counterparts, perhaps spending their time at or on the sea floor.

Melchor de Navarra, Duke of Palata

Don Melchor de Navarra y Rocafull, "jure uxoris" Duke of Palata, Prince of Massalubrense (sometimes "Melchor de Navarra y Rocaful"; 1626 – April 13, 1691) was a Spanish politician. From November 20, 1681 to August 15, 1689 he was viceroy of Peru.
Early career.
Navarra y Rocafull was born in 1626 in Aragon, Spain. He studied in the universities of Oviedo and Salamanca. He was a knight of the Order of Alcántara. He was also an advisor to the Crown of Aragón, a member of the council of state and of war in Naples, and president of the Council of Aragon (1671-1677). He was part of the junta that advised King Charles II during the first year of his reign. In 1681 he was named Viceroy and captain general of Peru, extending at that time from Panama to Chile.
As viceroy of Peru.
After his appointment as viceroy, he sailed from Cádiz on January 28, 1681. He arrived in Lima on November 20 of that year and received the government of the colony from Archbishop Melchor Liñán y Cisneros. He immediately set to work to put the government in order.
During his administration, he issued a decree to protect the Indigenous against oppressive church taxes (February 20, 1684). He conducted a census of the Indigenous, and required them to reside in their customary locations. He also reorganized the University of San Marcos in Lima. In 1683 he reestablished the Lima mint, which had been closed since 1572. Its reopening had been opposed by mining interests in Potosí and by the mint in Seville, which wanted to continue striking coins from silver sent from Peru.
The English corsair Edward Davis and other pirates appeared off the Pacific coast in 1684, beginning hostilities that lasted four years and requiring the viceroy to take costly defensive measures. In 1686 he ordered the construction of city walls in Lima and Trujillo) to defend against pirates. The planning of the wall in Lima was under the direction of "Cosmógrafo Real" Juan Ramón Koening (Jean Raymond Coninck). Also in 1686 Spanish forces repelled an attack by Davis.
The earthquake of 1687.
On October 20, 1687, an earthquake destroyed the city of Lima, killing 600 people there and 700 in Callao. Before the earthquake, Lima had been a city of straight streets, brick and adobe houses with wooden balconies, and seventy churches and bell towers. The earthquake destroyed much of this, including nearly all the churches and the city walls that were under construction. Wheat production in the area around Lima was interrupted. The viceroy and his wife took extraordinary measures to aid the victims, expending much money from their own pockets. The city was rebuilt, only to be destroyed again by the earthquake of 1746.
As in the earthquake of 1655, the painting of the crucified Brown Christ on an adobe wall in the Angolan quarter of Lima survived, confirming to the faithful its miraculous nature.
Walled cities.
Work began again on the wall in Lima. It was finished in 1687. It was 11,700 meters long and had a 5-meter wide esplanade along the top. There were 34 defensive bastions and five gates leading into the city. Its height was 4.5 meters, including 1.4 meters of parapets. From that time, Lima was surrounded by a strong semicircular wall. It began in the sector of Monserrate, located on the left bank of the Rímac River, then extended towards the south. After making a curve, the wall advanced to the north, finishing in the district of Maravillas, where it returned to the river. Protection of the northern side of Lima was entrusted to the volume of the Rímac River.
The oval wall protecting Trujillo, also of adobe, was built between 1685 and 1687. Trujillo became the third walled city of America, after Cartagena de Indias and Callao.
Viceroy Navarra prohibited the eating of "Solanum muricatum", a food plant cultivated in Peru from before the time of the Spanish arrival. It was known as "pepino" (cucumber) by the Spanish, although it was not a cucumber. This vegetable was thought to cause death if taken with liquor. The viceroy referred to it as "mataserrano" (highlander killer).
End of his administration.
Navarra's appointed successor, the Count of Cañete, died on the voyage from Acapulco to Paita. In his place was sent Melchor Portocarrero, 3rd Count of Monclova. The latter entered Lima and received the government on August 15, 1689. Viceroy Navarra sent a detailed report to Spain about his administration, dated November 18, 1689. He stayed in Lima until 1691, pending an investigation of his administration. He then sailed for Spain to occupy the presidency of the Council of Aragon, but both he and his wife, Francisca Toralto de Aragón (Toraldo d'Aragona), 2nd Duchess of Palata, in her own right, 2nd Principessa di Massalubrense, died on the journey and are buried in Portobello.

Martín Miguel de Güemes (; 8 February 1785 – 17 June 1821) was a military leader and popular caudillo who defended northwestern Argentina from the Spanish royalist army during the Argentine War of Independence.
Biography.
Güemes was born in Salta into a wealthy family. His father, Gabriel de Güemes Montero, born in Santander, in the Spanish province of Cantabria, was a learned man and was serving as royal treasurer of the Spanish crown. He ensured that his son had a good education with private teachers who taught him philosophical and scientific knowledge of his time. His mother was María Magdalena de Goyechea y la Corte, a "criolla" born in Salta.
He was sent to study at the Royal College of San Carlos in Buenos Aires. At 23 he started his military career and took part in the defense of Buenos Aires during the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, where Güemes achieved notability when he and his cavalrymen charged and took over the armed British merchantman "Justine", moored in shallow waters. After the formation of the first local government junta in the May Revolution of 1810, he joined the army destined to fight the Spanish troops at the Upper Peru, which was victorious in the Battle of Suipacha (in present-day Bolivia). He then returned to Buenos Aires and took part in the siege of Montevideo.
Güemes returned to Salta in 1815, and organized the resistance against the royalists (forces loyal to Spain) employing local gauchos trained in guerrilla tactics. He was appointed Governor of Salta Province and in November of that year, General José Rondeau, appointed leader of the Peru campaign to replace José de San Martín, suffered a defeat and attempted to take weapons from Salta's gauchos. Güemes refused and the Supreme Director of the Provinces of the Río de la Plata, Ignacio Álvarez Thomas, sent troops to help Rondeau. Eventually an agreement was reached, by which Güemes would continue to lead his forces and would help the armies sent from Buenos Aires.
Days later, the new Supreme Director Juan Martín de Pueyrredón had to address suspicions about Güemes's ability by travelling to Salta, and was so pleased with what he found that he promoted Güemes to colonel major. Generals José de San Martín and Manuel Belgrano supported Güemes as well. A letter from royalist general Joaquín de la Pezuela to the Viceroy of Peru explained that Güemes's army was waging, "almost with impunity, a slow but tiring and harmful war."
At the beginning of 1817, the royalist Marshal José de la Serna marched on Salta Province with a large force of experienced soldiers. Güemes organized a popular army and, on 1 March, retook Humahuaca. The royalist army of 5,400 men, with newly arrived reinforcements, was met with a scorched earth retreat combined with continuous guerrilla attacks. De la Serna arrived in Salta City on 16 April, but the population resisted. Faced with lightning skirmishes, declining morale and the news of San Martín's victory in the Battle of Chacabuco, the royalist troops retreated to the north.
Güemes was then left to his own devices, as San Martín was forced to stay in Chile for three years and Belgrano was recalled to Santa Fe Province to fight the federalist supporters of José Gervasio Artigas on behalf of the centralist government of Buenos Aires, now presided by Rondeau. In March 1819 a new royalist army invaded northwestern Argentina. Güemes did not obtain reinforcements and resorted to extorting money by force from the upper-class landowners of Salta. In February 1820 another wave of Spanish troops invaded San Salvador de Jujuy and Salta, but were eventually repelled.
The year 1820 marked a turning point of a long civil war in Argentina, with provinces fighting among themselves and with Buenos Aires, after the fall of the central government following the Battle of Cepeda. Güemes found himself with enemies on two fronts: the royalist troops in the north, and Bernabé Aráoz, governor of Tucumán, in the south. Aráoz had struck an alliance with Salta's rich landowners, opposed to Güemes, and defeated him on 3 April 1821. The Cabildo of Salta, dominated by conservatives, deposed Güemes from the governorship. His gauchos retook power in May. Soon, however, colonel José María Valdés, a Spanish rustler in the service of the royalist army, took advantage of his knowledge of the terrain, promised the landowners to respect their properties, and with their support he occupied Salta again on 7 June. Güemes fled the city, but was shot in the back. He managed to get to his camp in La Chamical, gave the last orders to his army and died of his wounds on 17 June in the Quebrada de La Horqueta. His men retook Salta from the royalists, this time permanently, on 22 July.
In popular culture.
The 1942 film, "La Guerra Gaucha", is set in the wars in which Güemes fought.

Joe Kendrick (footballer, born 1983)

Joe Kendrick (born 26 June 1983) is an Irish former professional footballer who played as left back or centre back and is a Republic of Ireland under 21 international, Who currently plays for the mighty North Shields O35s
Career.
Kendrick started his career at Newcastle United as a promising young player and played youth and reserve team football and spent four years at St James' Park before moving on to TSV 1860 Munich in the summer of 2004. Kendrick started brightly at 1860 Munich before a Serious foot injury halted his progress.
Kendrick returned to England and played for Darlington at the end of the 2005–06 season and 2006–07 and went on to make over Seventy appearances for the Quakers.
Kendrick joined Torquay United on a short-term deal earlier in the summer of 2006 but left Plainmoor before even kicking a ball due to a problem gaining international clearance to play.
In September 2006 Kendrick joined Conference National side Tamworth, but left due to travelling problems from his home in Newcastle and left in January 2007 after only making 15 appearances for the club.
In January 2007, Kendrick joined Workington and quickly became a firm fans' favourite in which Workington had lost the services of two left backs during the 2006–07 season. Kendrick made his debut for Workington in the Conference North match against Hucknall Town on 27 January 2007.
Kendrick scored his first goal for Workington on 23 March 2007 against Nuneaton Borough with a spectacular 40-yard shot over the keeper into the net in the 2–0 win.

Marine Corps Times

Marine Corps Times (ISSN 1522-0869) is a newspaper serving active, reserve and retired United States Marine Corps personnel and their families, providing news, information and analysis as well as community and lifestyle features, educational supplements, and resource guides. It is published 26 times per year.
"Marine Corps Times" is published by the Sightline Media Group, which is a part of TEGNA Digital, which itself is owned by TEGNA, Inc. The group was called the Army Times Publishing Company until 1997, when it was sold to Gannett and renamed Gannett Government Media. In 2015, it was spun off into one of the digital properties of TEGNA, and renamed Sightline. In March 2016, TEGNA sold Sightline Media Group to Regent, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm controlled by investor Michael Reinstein.
History.
"Marine Corps Times" traces its roots to the 1940s, when "Army Times", founded by Mel Ryder, had reporters covering the U.S. Army Air Corps and U.S. Army Air Forces. The Army Times Publishing Company later added "Air Force Times", "Navy Times", and, in 1999, "Marine Corps Times".
"Marine Corps Times" writer C. Mark Brinkley was among the first journalists to embed with ground troops in Afghanistan in November 2001 during Operation Swift Freedom, which was the Pentagon's first opportunity to Embed Journalists.
In 2005, "Marine Corps Times" received an Associated Press Managing Editors association Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Public Service in the under-40,000 circulation category for its investigative story on the recall of body armor.
"Marine Corps Times" and Brinkley were also responsible for exposing the fabricated military record claimed by Joshua Adam Garcia, a contestant on Food Network's 2007 season of "The Next Food Network Star", resulting in Garcia's resignation from the cooking competition reality show.
In November 2010, senior writer Dan Lamothe broke the news that the Marine Corps had recommended former Cpl. Dakota Meyer for the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award for valor, for bravery in Afghanistan in September 2009. Meyer's case was approved in July 2011, making him the first living Marine to receive the medal since the Vietnam War.
In spring 2011, Lamothe received the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation's Maj. Megan McClung Award, which honors one journalist annually for dispatch reporting abroad. Lamothe was honored for his work in May and June 2010, when he embedded with 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines, in Afghanistan's Marjah district.
In fall 2011, Lamothe and staff photographer Thomas Brown received honorable mention from the Military Reporters and Editors organization for their blogging from the battlefield during the same embedded assignment. They finished behind "The New York Times" in MRE's online interactive award category.

The Calcutta Review

The Calcutta Review is a bi-annual periodical, now published by the Calcutta University press, featuring scholarly articles from a variety of disciplines.
History.
The "Calcutta Review" was founded in May 1844, by Sir John William Kaye and Reverend Alexander Duff. Through the journal, Sir John Kaye "to bring together such useful information, and propagate such sound opinions, relating to Indian affairs, as will, it is hoped, conduce, in some small measure, directly or indirectly, to the amelioration of the condition of the people".
The periodical proved to be successful, and was published as a quarterly up until 1912. Sir John Kaye was Editor of four issues, and then retired due to ill health. He remained the owner of the review until 1855, when it was purchased by Meredith Townsend. Thacker, Spink and Company bought it in 1857. It was printed by Sanders and Cowes until 1857, when it moved to the Serampore Press. When Rev. T. Ridsdale took over as editor, it was published by R. C. Lepage and Company.
The journal was not published in 1912. In its second series, from 1913 to 1920, it was published bi-annually. In 1921, it was acquired by the Calcutta University press, which now releases it bi-annually.

Closed system (control theory)

The terms closed system and "open system" have long been defined in the widely (and long before any sort of amplifier was invented) established subject of thermodynamics, in terms that have nothing to do with the concepts of feedback and feedforward. The terms 'feedforward' and 'feedback' arose first in the 1920s in the theory of amplifier design, more recently than the thermodynamic terms. Negative feedback was eventually patented by H.S Black in 1934. In thermodynamics, an open system is one that can take in and give out ponderable matter. In thermodynamics, a closed system is one that cannot take in or give out ponderable matter, but may be able to take in or give out radiation and heat and work or any form of energy. In thermodynamics, a closed system can be further restricted, by being 'isolated': an isolated system cannot take in nor give out either ponderable matter or any form of energy. It does not make sense to try to use these well established terms to try to distinguish the presence or absence of feedback in a control system.
The theory of control systems leaves room for systems with both feedforward pathways and feedback elements or pathways. The terms 'feedforward' and 'feedback' refer to elements or paths within a system, not to a system as a whole. THE input to the system comes from outside it, as energy from the signal source by way of some possibly leaky or noisy path. Part of the output of a system can be compounded, with the intermediacy of a feedback path, in some way such as addition or subtraction, with a signal derived from the system input, to form a 'return balance signal' that is input to a PART of the system to form a feedback loop within the system. (It is not correct to say that part of the output of a system can be used as THE input to the system.)
There can be feedforward paths within the system in parallel with one or more of the feedback loops of the system so that the system output is a compound of the outputs of the feedback loops and of the parallel feedforward paths. Feedforward and feedback often occur in one and the same system. It makes sense to speak of a control system only if it contains at least one feedforward path; the presence or absence of feedback is contingent.
A feedback loop needs within itself both a feedforward element and a feedback element. For example, the feedforward element (for example a transistor) in an amplifier has access to a controlled power reservoir and provides power gain for the loop and is therefore called an "active" element. The feedback element is often, but not always, passive (for example a resistor). It makes sense to speak of a feedback loop only when referring to a loop with a well-defined active feedforward element. Without this, a loop does not have a definite sense (clockwise or anti-clockwise) of signal circulation by which one could distinguish its feedforward and feedback elements. Without this definite sense of signal circulation one is looking at a mere mesh in a network, and it makes no sense to speak of a feedback loop.
A feedback loop can contain further feedback loops within itself, or it can provide a pathway inside another feedback loop, provided its 'input' and 'output' are defined.
A 1993 paper, "General Systems Theory" by David S. Walonick, Ph.D., states in part, "A closed system is one where interactions occur only among the system components and not with the environment. An open system is one that receives input from the environment and/or releases output to the environment. The basic characteristics of an open system is the dynamic interaction of its components, while the basis of a cybernetic model is the feedback cycle. Open systems can tend toward higher levels of organization (negative entropy), while closed systems can only maintain or decrease in organization."

African-American organized crime

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, African American organized crime emerged following the first and second large-scale migrations of African Americans from the Southern United States to major cities of the Northeast, Midwest, and later the West Coast. In many of these newly established communities and neighborhoods, criminal activities such as illegal gambling (e.g. the numbers racket) and speakeasies were seen in the post-World War I and Prohibition eras. Although the majority of these businesses in African-American neighborhoods were operated by African-Americans, it is often unclear the extent to which these operations were run independently of the larger criminal organizations of the time.
History.
Origin and the role of segregation.
Jean Baptiste Point du Sable was a pioneering figure credited as the founder of Chicago. Born around 1745 in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), DuSable was of African and French descent. In the late 1770s, DuSable established a successful trading post near the mouth of the Chicago River, on what is now the site of downtown Chicago. His homestead became a key hub for trade between Native American tribes, French traders, and British and American settlers. 
Freedman alongside fugitive slaves formed the first African-American community in Chicago in the 1840s. With the start of World War I, larger numbers of African Americans moved into Chicago. The war opened up numerous jobs, causing 50,000 African Americans to move into Chicago from 1916 to 1920, with 90% of the population being on Chicago's South Side. The South Side of Chicago grew to house a population of around 300,000 African Americans. Between 1919-1922, known as Red Summer, there was a large swell of migration north to escape Klan violence in the south It was very easy for Blacks to move into Chicago's South Side, but discrimination and segregation made it difficult for them to move to other parts of the city.
There is not much published information on Black American organized crime groups, especially between the years of 1890 and 1960. Analysis of Blacks in Chicago support evidence that the lack of information is connected to the segregation of the time. Chicago's South Side had its own way of life completely separate to that of "white" Chicago, therefore organized crime happening on the South Side was most likely not heavily reported on.
Early Black American crime had a major focus on gambling in saloons and then jazz clubs and speakeasies. Policy gambling, similar to Numbers Game, became increasingly popular in Chicago's South Side.
Prohibition and the Great Depression.
New York.
During the 1920s and 1930s, African American organized crime was centered in New York's Harlem, the largest black city in the world, where the numbers racket was largely controlled by Casper Holstein and the "Madam Queen of Policy", Stephanie St. Clair. St. Clair later testified at the Seabury Investigation that, during 1923 to 1928, the NYPD continued to arrest her number runners despite her making payoffs. At that time, Harlem numbers rackets were largely operated by independent policy bankers such as St. Clair; the Harlem rackets later began to receive more protection from police interference following their eventual (partial) takeover by mobster Dutch Schultz and the largely Italian and Jewish "National Crime Syndicate" in the late 1930s.
Chicago.
Prohibition in the 1920s increased criminal activity in Chicago's South Side. There was a deep connection between politics and organized crime. Black nightclubs were run by Black Republican Party organizers and Daniel McKee Jackson, said to be the most powerful vice-king in Black Chicago, was a candidate for state representative.
In 1921, Chicago's South Side was struggling with widespread gambling and other forms of criminal activity. Chicago Blacks were able to have such success in the gambling business due to their connection with Republican mayor of Chicago, William Hale Thompson, who treated Blacks more equitably than his predecessors and recognized that Black gamblers greatly supported their local government. But in 1931, Thompson lost re-election to Anton Cermak. The Black gamblers eventually left the Republican party to join Cermak's Democratic fold, where they had to pay him bribes to keep operating. When Cermak died, Edward Kelly became mayor and allowed gambling along with other criminal activity to return to the South Side.
Post-World War II.
Prison sometimes played a role in creating African-American organized crime groups in the post-WWII era. Connections made in prison strengthened connections outside of prison among ex-convicts.
New York.
In the years following the end of the World War II, Black American organized crime grew along with the rise of Black American social consciousness and later political, social and economic upward mobility. The Black American gangster Bumpy Johnson established close ties with the New York Italian-American Mafia and Jewish Mob in the post-war years, establishing some degree of independence for Black American organized crime groups in Harlem from the dominant New York organized crime groups. Many of the major drug traffickers in the United States emerged during the early-to-mid-1960s, such as Leroy "Nicky" Barnes, Guy Fisher, and Frank Lucas, taking advantage of the increasing political strength during the civil rights movement.
Previously dependent partially on the political and police protection of New York's Five Families, Black American gangsters were able to negotiate with outside criminal organizations and establish a stronger independent hold over certain territories, and the Mafia's ability to control or impose a "street tax" on criminal operations in Black American neighborhoods began to wane. Black American and Italian-American organized crime groups in the Northeast and Midwest instead began to cooperate (and at times compete) to a greater extent than in previous decades, increasingly sharing profits and coordinating rackets.
By the early 1970s, the large narcotics empires created by Nicky Barnes, Frank Matthews, and Frank Lucas began expanding beyond Harlem as Lucas sought to ultimately control a large-scale drug trafficking operation by gaining control of a network from Indochina directly to the streets of ghettos across the country. Other criminal groups started smuggling marijuana and cocaine in cities including New York City, Baltimore, Washington, D.C. as well as in New Jersey, California, Florida and Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
California.
In the 1940s, thousands of Black Americans migrated from the South into Los Angeles for World War II jobs. Overcrowding became a huge issue, especially since legalized restrictive covenants kept Blacks from moving into other areas of LA. Violent clashes arose between the Black and white populations. Black gangs were created as protection against white violence. They first arose on the Eastside of LA before extending south and west.
Eventually, white residents began moving out of South Los Angeles into the suburbs. In the early 1960s, Black gang violence continued to grow as whites left the area. The Black gangs, which started as protection groups, began fighting each other. But in 1965 after the Watts Rebellion, much of the violence between the gangs dissipated. Members instead focused on fighting police brutality and other social injustices. Black gang activity declined in the years following with a turn towards political advocacy.
But by the late 1960s, new street gangs emerged as Black consciousness fell away with political leadership. Immature teens without leadership soon became involved in criminal activity and by 1972 one of the first gang murders of the time took place. Many factors, including severe radicalization, caused these violent street gangs to surface, one such gang being the well-known Crips.
By the 1990s, over 270 gangs emerged and an epidemic of homicides emerged.
On the West Coast in Oakland, California, Felix Mitchell and his 69 Mob ran a large scale drugs trafficking operation, generating income of nearly a million dollars in monthly business.
Other Areas.
According to a United States Senate sub-committee on organized crime during the 1980s, one of the most sophisticated, corporate-like, structured, organized crime groups outside of the Italian mafia was the Young Boys Inc. (AKA YBI). Founded by a small group of teen-aged friends on Detroit's west side in the mid-1970s, in less than two years, YBI took over the majority of Southeast Michigan's heroin trade with absolutely no interference from any other crime groups.
At its peak, YBI sales were an estimated $300,000 a day. The murder of one of the founders, Dwayne Davis (AKA Wonderful Wayne), and a series of federal indictments on 2 of the remaining bosses and 40 of the top lieutenants crippled YBI in 1982. There were a few lieutenants who survived, one in particular carried on the organization in Detroit and Boston through the late 1980s until crack cocaine became the drug of choice over heroin.
African-American gangs.
Black Mafia.
The Black Mafia was an African-American crime group located in Philadelphia. Founded in 1968, they were known for narcotics, the numbers racket, misusing government funds, extortion, murder, and more.
The group didn't target everyday citizens, but targeted other criminals. They were known for their violent crimes and used murder as a means to keep that reputation. They used the numbers racket to control their territories and gambling. They also created fake community groups, such as the Council for Youth and Urban Development as fronts to receive government funding.
The Black Mafia also had members that were linked to the Nation of Islam. They also took over the heroin trade and extorted other groups. Later, a younger group paying homage to the Black Mafia named themselves the Junior Black Mafia and were also heavily involved in drug trafficking, specifically crack-cocaine, during the mid-1980s to early 1990s.
The Black Mafia is no longer active and was succeeded by the Junior Black Mafia.
Bloods.
The Bloods are a Black American street gang that was formed in Los Angeles in the 1970s. They are known to be extremely violent. They were originally formed as a protection against another street gang, the Crips. These street gangs remain rivals to this day.
During the 1980s the Bloods were involved in the distribution of crack-cocaine, which allowed them to grow and become more powerful.
The Bloods eventually spread outside Los Angeles, developing chapters along the East Coast. These chapters became known as The United Blood Nation (UBN). A chapter, known as the East Coast Bloods, also developed within the New York City Department of Corrections in 1993. Today there are likely Bloods in every state. Despite certain cultural similarities, these chapters have many differences and run completely independent of each other.
The Bloods are widely associated with the color red and are still active today.
Crips.
The Crips are a Black American street gang that was formed in Los Angeles in the 1960s. Much like their rivals, the Bloods, they are known for their violence and are also involved in large-scale drug trafficking including crack cocaine.
The Crips have spread outside of Los Angeles, establishing chapters across the nation, including in Anchorage.
They are widely associated with the color blue and are still active today.
Gangster Disciples.
The Gangster Disciples are one of the largest and most influential crime groups in Chicago and their membership even extends outside of Chicago. They are a Black American crime group formed in the 1970s after splitting from the Black Disciples. In the 1960s the Gangster Disciples and the Black Disciples operated together under the Black Gangster Disciple Nation, but after the split in 1972, the two groups violently fought over territory. The Gangster Disciples are structured similarly to corporate enterprises while the Black Disciples are structured similarly to religions. They are still rivals today. The Gangster Disciples have other rivals, including the Black P Stones and Latin Kings.

Barleria cristata

Barleria cristata, the Philippine violet, bluebell barleria or crested Philippine violet, is a plant species in the family Acanthaceae.
Distribution and habitat.
It is native to a wide area ranging from Southern China to India and Myanmar.
Cultivated as an ornamental plant in villages and gardens, it has become naturalized in Hawaii, where it grows in dry habitats. In Fiji, where it is known as "tombithi" and in Christmas Island (Indian Ocean), the shrub grows also as a ruderal species along roadsides and disturbed areas from near sea level to about 100 m.
Description.
It grows as a shrub 60 –100 cm tall. The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and pale green on the lower surface. They are elliptic to narrowly ovate.
The flowers are about 5 cm long, funnel-shaped in violet, pink, or white color. The fruits are about 1.5 cm long ellipsoid capsules. They become glabrous and glossy at maturity.
Uses.

Genoa Cathedral

Genoa Cathedral or Metropolitan Cathedral of Saint Lawrence (, "Cattedrale di San Lorenzo") is a Roman Catholic cathedral in the Italian city of Genoa. It is dedicated to Saint Lawrence (San Lorenzo), and is the seat of the Archbishop of Genoa. The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Gelasius II in 1118 and was built between the twelfth century and the fourteenth century as fundamentally a medieval building, with some later additions. Secondary naves and side covers are of Romanesque style and the main facade is Gothic from the early thirteenth century, while capitals and columns with interior corridors date from the early fourteenth century. The bell tower and dome were built in the sixteenth century.
History.
Excavations under the pavement and in the area in front of today's west front have brought to light walls and pavements of Roman age as well as pre-Christian sarcophagi, suggesting the existence of a burial ground in the site. Later a church devoted to the Twelve Apostles was built, which was in turn flanked and replaced by a new cathedral dedicated to Saint Lawrence, in Romanesque style. Money came from the successful enterprises of the Genoese fleets in the Crusades.
The first cathedral, now the basilica of St. Syrus, was founded probably in the 5th or 6th century AD, devoted to Saint Syrus, bishop of Genoa. The transferring of the cathedral favored the urbanization of the zone that, with the construction of its walls in 1155, and the fusion of the three ancient city nuclei ("castrum", "civitas" and "burgus"), became the heart of the city. The piazza, in the absence of other public squares and centers of lay power, was the city's only public space for the whole of the Middle Ages. The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Gelasius II in 1118, and from 1133 had archiepiscopal rank. After the fire of 1296, provoked by fights between Guelphs and Ghibellines, the building was partly restored and partly rebuilt. Between 1307 and 1312 the façade was completed, the inner colonnades rebuilt with capitals and matronei added. The Romanesque structures remained pretty untouched, and frescoes of religious subject were also added.
Various altars and chapels have been erected between the 14th and 15th centuries. The small loggia on the north-eastern tower of the façade was built in 1455; the opposite one, in Mannerist style, is from 1522. In 1550 the Perugian architect Galeazzo Alessi was commissioned by the city magistrates to plan the reconstruction of the entire building; however, he executed only the covering of the nave and aisles, the pavement, the dome and the apse.
The construction of the cathedral finished in the 17th century. The dome and the medieval parts were restored in 1894–1900. The present 7 bells are tuned in the major scale of C.
Among the artworks inside the church are ceiling frescoes in a chapel on the north by Luca Cambiaso; a "Crucifixion with Saints (St. Sebastian's Vision)" by Barocci; in front of the organ is an "Episode from the life of St. Lawrence" by Giovanni Andrea Ansaldo; the ceiling fresco in the presbytery of the "Martyrdom of St Lawrence" was painted by Lazzaro Tavarone; and an "Assumption of the Virgin" (1914) by Gaetano Previati. The church also contains 14th-century frescoes in the Byzantine style in the main portal. Sculptural works include a statue in the chapel of St. John by Domenico Gagini ; a "Virgin" and a "St. John the Baptist" by Andrea Sansovino. Other works include works by Matteo Civitali, Taddeo Carlone, and Giacomo and Guglielmo Della Porta .
The Museum of the Treasury lies under the cathedral and holds a collection of jewellery and silverware from 9 AD up to the present. Among the most important pieces are the Sacro Catino brought by Guglielmo Embriaco after the conquest of Caesarea and supposed to be the chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper; the Cassa Processionale del Corpus Domini ; and the Zaccaria Cross, a Byzantine reliquary that holds supposed relics of the True Cross. Dating back to the 9th and 13th centuries, it was originally part of the treasure of the archbishops of Ephesus and was later brought back to Genoa by the Zaccaria family, who donated it to the cathedral.
War damage.
The cathedral had a fortunate escape on February 9, 1941, when the city was being shelled as part of Operation Grog. Because of a crew error the British battleship fired a armour-piercing shell into the south-eastern corner of the nave. The relatively soft material failed to detonate the fuse and the shell is still there.
The inscription, which gives thanks for the cathedral's escape reads: 
QUESTA BOMBA LANCIATA DALLA FLOTTA INGLESE PUR SFONDANDO LE PARETI DI QUESTA INSIGNE CATTEDRALE QUI CADEVA INESPLOSA IL IX FEBBRAIO MCMXLI 
A RICONOSCENZA PERENNE GENOVA CITTÀ DI MARIA VOLLE INCISA IN PIETRA LA MEMORIA DI TANTA GRAZIA
 ("This bomb, launched by the British Navy, though breaking through the walls of this great cathedral, fell here unexploded on February 9, 1941". "In perpetual gratitude, Genoa, the City of Mary, desired to engrave in stone, the memory of such grace".)

The Happy Day

The Happy Day is a musical comedy in two acts by Seymour Hicks, with music by Sidney Jones and Paul Rubens, and lyrics by Adrian Ross and Rubens. It was produced by George Edwardes's company (by the estate's executor, Robert Evett) and was directed by Evett. Set in the fictional country of Valaria, the story concerns a royal couple who dislike each other but ultimately fall in love. A masquerade scene provides opportunities for mistaken identity.
The musical opened at Daly's Theatre in London on 13 May 1916 and ran for 241 performances. It starred Winifred Barnes, José Collins and Arthur Wontner, who played the Ruritanian prince. Later Bertram Wallis joined the cast.
Background.
"The Happy Day" opened during World War I in the same year as three other tremendously successful shows in London: "Chu Chin Chow", "Theodore &amp; Co" and "The Bing Boys are Here". Audiences, including servicemen on leave, wanted light and uplifting entertainment during the war, and these shows delivered it. The show was Jones's last success. A review in "The Illustrated London News" commented that the costumes were "sumptuous" and praised the comedy and the music of the piece, as well as the cast, especially Collins "with her attractive voice and picturesque personality."
Popular songs from "The Happy Day" included "Bohemia" and "I Don't Seem to Want You When You're With Me".

Ignacio Padilla

Ignacio Padilla (November 7, 1968 – August 20, 2016) 
was a Mexican writer whose works were translated into several languages. Padilla helped found the Crack Movement, along with fellow writers Eloy Urroz, Jorge Volpi, and Pedro Angel Palou, as a means for Mexican authors to find their own voice and write beyond magic realism.
Biography.
Early life.
Padilla was born in Mexico City in 1968. From an early age, Padilla noted that he was drawn to writing, and as he grew older, he became immersed in the literary works of James Joyce, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Robert Louis Stevenson, whose works often centered on the theme of human identity.
Education.
Padilla attended high school at Waterford Kamhlaba United World College of Southern Africa in Mbabane, Eswatini, and thereafter received his undergraduate education at the Universidad Iberoamericana where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies. He later received a Master's degree in English Literature from the University of Edinburgh and a Doctor of Philosophy in Hispanic-American literature from the University of Salamanca.
Early career.
Upon completing his higher education, Padilla returned to Mexico. During the early 1990s, Padilla worked as an editorial director for "Playboy" magazine's Latin American publication while also writing his column, "El baúl de los cadáveres", in Mexican literary magazine "Sábado."
In 1989, Padilla received the Alfonso Reyes literary award for his work "Subterráneos", and in 1994 the Juan de la Cabada literary award for his children's story "Las tormentas del mar embotellado", the Juan Rulfo Literary Award for a first novel, "La catedral de los ahogados", and the Malcolm Lowry Literary Award for his literary essay "El dorado esquivo: espejismo mexicano de Paul Bowles". That same year, Padilla published "El año de los gatos amurallados", which was awarded the Kalpa literary award for Science Fiction.
The Crack Generation.
In 1996, Padilla joined with longtime friends and fellow writers Jorge Volpi, Eloy Urroz, Pedro Ángel Palou García, and Ricardo Chávez Castañeda, who collectively presented a proposal based on their literary criticism and personal opinions of Mexican and Latin American literature. This literary critique, a reaction to the Latin American Boom, became known as the Crack Manifesto and was presented as a means for Mexican authors to find their own voice, and write beyond Magic Realism. In addition to breaking with the Latin American tradition of Magic Realism, the Crack Movement called for a return to the complexity of plot and style as found in the works of such Latin American authors as Julio Cortázar and Jorge Luis Borges. That same year, Sandro Cohen published "Nueva Imagen", a collection of stories by the authors of the Crack Movement.
In 1999 Padilla received the José Revueltas literary award for his literary essay "Los funerales del alcaraván: historia apócrifa del realismo mágico", as well as the Gilberto Owen literary award for his short story publication "Las antípodas y el siglo". In 2000, Padilla received the "Premio Primavera de Novela" for his novel "Amphitryon".
21st century.
In 2001, Padilla was chosen as Cultural Attaché for the Mexican embassy to the United Kingdom, a post he held until 2003. During this time, he republished "Crónicas africanas" which he had previously published in Mexican literary magazine "Nostromo."
In 2007, President Felipe Calderón Hinojosa named Ignacio Padilla director of the José Vasconcelos National Library. However, the structure of the building in which the library was housed was unsafe, and in March 2007 the decision was made to temporarily close it. Padilla released a statement that repairs to the building were absolutely necessary, and that he would not open the doors until the building was safe from structural damages. On August 15, 2007, the newspaper "Milenio Diario" published an article stating that Padilla had stepped down as director of the national library.
Death.
On the night of August 20, 2016, Padilla was killed in a car accident while driving at the central state of Querétaro. He was 47 years old.

Sleep to Dream

"Sleep to Dream" is a song written and recorded by American alternative singer-songwriter Fiona Apple. It was released on February 25, 1997 by Work Records and Columbia Records as the second single from her debut studio album, "Tidal".
The song's accompanying music video was filmed by French director Stéphane Sednaoui and received positive reviews. Apple won the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in a Video at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, in which she garnered worldwide controversy after she proclaimed during her acceptance speech: "This world is bullshit, and you shouldn't model your life about what we think is cool, and what we're wearing and what we're saying." Despite peaking at only number 28 on the "Billboard" Alternative Songs chart, the song remains one of Apple's most successful singles to date.
Background and release.
"Sleep to Dream" was reportedly Fiona Apple's first lyric, penned when she was 14. She recorded the song with collaborator Jon Brion in 1995 immediately after being signed to a record deal with Sony Music Entertainment. It was later released as the third single from "Tidal". Apple performed "Sleep to Dream" in various events, notably on the television special "MTV Unplugged: Fiona Apple". A live version recorded at the SXSW appears on the deluxe version of Apple's fourth studio album, "The Idler Wheel..." (2012).
Chart performance and critical reception.
The song peaked at number 28 on the "Billboard" Alternative Songs chart on the week ending April 26, 1997, and spent 13 weeks there. It also peaked at number 84 on the UK Singles Chart (number 79 on the compressed chart, with exclusions below number 75), becoming Apple's first song to chart in the United Kingdom. "Sleep to Dream" has also received critical acclaim from music critics. Christopher John Farley of "Time" wrote: "In "Sleep to Dream", she assumes a smoldering anger that comes off like a muted Alanis Morissette." "People" magazine also remarked: "A sort of hybrid of Alanis Morissette and Nina Simone—part rebellious rocker and part sultry jazz singer—Apple comes on tough in songs like "Sleep to Dream," a slow, smoldering tune in which she kisses off a reluctant lover ("You say love is a hell you cannot bear/And I say gimme mine back and then go there, for all I care")."
American R&amp;B singer Macy Gray tried to cover the song, but found difficulty doing it instead. She remarked "her songs are so moody, and if you take it out of that it doesn't sound right." American rapper Kanye West also expressed enthusiasm over the song's lyrical content, saying: "one of my favorite opening lines to a song... "I have never been so insulted in all my life!" American soul singer Bettye LaVette's studio album "I've Got My Own Hell to Raise" (2005) is titled after a lyric of "Sleep to Dream", which also includes a cover of the song.
Music video.
The music video was directed by French director Stéphane Sednaoui and was released in February 1997. It features Apple singing in different rooms in an apartment, all the while suffering from insomnia.
1997 MTV Video Music Awards acceptance speech controversy.
Apple won the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in a Video for the video at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards on September 4, 1997, where she was presented by Elton John. During her acceptance speech, Apple was quoted saying:
"I didn't prepare a speech and I'm sorry. But I'm glad that I didn't, because I'm not going to do this like everybody else does it. 'Cause everybody that I should be thanking, I'm really sorry, but I have to use this time. See Maya Angelou said that we, we as human beings, at our best can only create opportunities, and I'm going to use this opportunity the way I want to use it. So what I want to say is everybody out there that's watching, everybody that's watching this world. This world is bullshit! And you shouldn't model your life—wait a second—you shouldn't model your life about what you think that we think is cool, and what we're wearing and what we're saying and everything. Go with yourself. Go with yourself."
She ended her speech thanking her mother, her sister (Maude Maggart) and Andrew Slater (the song's producer). She said to the audience "It's just stupid that I'm in this world. But you're all very cool to me. So thank you very much." Immediately after ending her speech, host Chris Rock remarked: "Let's hear it for Fiona X!" The speech was initially greeted with applause and cheer from the audience. However, it received condemnation from most of the press media around the world, with some of them, such as "The New Yorker" and "NYRock", deemed it to be "ungrateful" and "ridiculous".
The incident became one of the controversial moments in VMA history, and a career-defining moment for Apple. However, she never apologized for the matter. In an interview with the "Rolling Stone" on January 22, 1998, Apple responded by saying: "I just had something on my mind and I just said it. And that's really the foreshadowing of my entire career and my entire life. When I have something to say, I'll say it." In an interview with "New York" magazine in June 2012, Apple remarked what happened after the incident: "When I walked backstage, I was proud of myself. And they gave me the silent treatment! They pretended I wasn't there! It was the moment I learned that they needed me more than I need them. It was one of the best things I've ever done."

Brooklyn Boy

Brooklyn Boy is a play by American playwright Donald Margulies. The play premiered in 2004 at South Coast Repertory and then on Broadway in 2005.
Plot.
Novelist Eric Weiss, critically celebrated but unsuccessful, "arrives" when his new, autobiographical novel becomes a best-seller. An outsider all his life, he is suddenly on the inside of everything: town cars, television studios, the Sunday book review. But as his career takes off, his personal life stutters.
His father lies ill in Maimonides Hospital, Jewish Brooklyn's version of the river Styx, wondering when Eric will produce his first grandchild. His former friends and neighbors in Brooklyn celebrate his success while simultaneously being suspicious about his attitude toward them–in life and in his novel. And his success, rather than oiling the waters of his marriage, troubles them for him and his writer-wife.
Productions.
"Brooklyn Boy" is Margulies' first work for the stage since winning the Pulitzer Prize for Drama with his "Dinner with Friends". Tony Award-winning director Daniel Sullivan, who directed South Coast Repertory's production of "Dinner with Friends" returned to South Coast Repertory, Costa Mesa, California, to direct the world premiere of "Brooklyn Boy". This was a co-production by South Coast Repertory and the Manhattan Theatre Club, and was commissioned by SCR and developed at the company's 2003 Pacific Playwrights Festival. The play ran from September 10, 2004, to October 10, 2004. The cast starred Adam Arkin as Eric Weiss; Allan Miller as his father Manny; and Dana Reeve as his wife Nina. Arye Gross and Ari Graynor also appeared.
The play premiered on Broadway at the Biltmore Theatre on January 13, 2005, in previews and officially on February 3, 2005, and closed on March 27, 2005, after 62 performances and 23 previews. The SCR cast reprised their roles, except that Polly Draper took the role of Nina. Adam Arkin was nominated for the 2005 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Play. The play was nominated for the 2005 Outer Critics Circle Award, Outstanding New Broadway Play.
Ben Brantley, in his review for "The New York Times", wrote: "...has the courage to confront head-on the predictability of the midlife crisis it portrays...Brookyn Boy, smoothly directed by Daniel Sullivan and acted with fine-grained conviction by a cast led by Adam Arkin, may indeed be Mr. Margulies's most personally heartfelt work. But while this comic drama is steeped in an admirably humble and often touching spirit of acceptance, it seldom does what first-rate plays must do and what Mr. Margulies has achieved repeatedly before: it does not make the familiar seem fresh.".

Ichthyoallyeinotoxism

Ichthyoallyeinotoxism, or hallucinogenic fish inebriation, comes from eating certain species of fish found in several parts of the tropics, the effects of which are reputed to be similar in some aspects to LSD. Experiences may include vivid auditory and visual hallucinations. This has given rise to the collective common name "dream fish" for ichthyoallyeinotoxic fish.
The species most commonly claimed to be capable of producing this kind of toxicity include several species from the genus "Kyphosus", including "Kyphosus fuscus", "K. cinerascens", and "K. vaigiensis". It is unclear whether the toxins are produced by the fish themselves or by marine algae in their diet, but a dietary origin may be more likely.
"Sarpa salpa", a species of bream, can induce LSD-like hallucinations if it is eaten. These widely distributed coastal fish are called "the fish that make dreams" in Arabic. In 2006, two men who ate fish, apparently the "Sarpa salpa" caught in the Mediterranean, were affected by ichthyoallyeinotoxism and experienced hallucinations lasting for several days.
Other hallucinogenic fish are "Siganus spinus", called "the fish that inebriates" in Reunion Island, and "Mulloides flavolineatus" (formerly "Mulloidichthys samoensis"), called "the chief of ghosts" in Hawaii.

George Ferrers

George Ferrers ( – 1579) was a courtier and writer. In an incident which arose in 1542 while he was a Member of Parliament for Plymouth in the Parliament of England, he played a key role in the development of parliamentary privilege.
As a writer, he is best remembered for his contributions to "The Mirror for Magistrates". He apparently wrote plays for court performance, and was particularly praised as a writer of tragedies, but these were never published and are now lost.
Life.
George Ferrers was the eldest son of Thomas Ferrers of St Albans and his wife, Alice, the daughter of John Cockworthy of Cockworthy, Devon. He is said to have graduated as a bachelor of canon law at the University of Cambridge before being admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 22 November 1534. There is no evidence that he followed a legal career, although he was a frequent litigant, and was praised by John Leland for his oratory at the bar.
According to Bindoff and Woudjuysen, Ferrers's literary interests were initially legal and antiquarian. It was apparently Ferrers who in 1533 edited and translated The Great Boke of Statutes which spanned the period from the first year of Edward III to the twenty-fifth year of the reign of Henry VIII. His translation of Magna Carta and other statutes was published in 1534. He may also have been the George Ferras who supplied Leland with information about the poet John Gower.
By 1538 Ferrers had entered the service of Henry VIII's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell. After Cromwell's fall, Ferrers entered the King's service, and was present at the reception of the King's fourth wife, Anne of Cleves. From at least 1542 to 1547 he was a page of the chamber, and in 1544 attended the King in France. When Henry VIII died on 28 January 1547, he left Ferrers a small bequest in his will.
Parliamentary career and the "Ferrers Case" of 1543.
Ferrers sat as a member of parliament for Plymouth in 1542, 1545 and 1553, for Cirencester in 1547, for Barnstaple in April 1554, Brackley in November 1554 and 1555 and for St Albans in 1571.
The most notable episode in Ferrers's political career has become known as 'Ferrers Case'. In March 1542 Ferrers was arrested for a debt of '200 marks or thereabouts' for which he had stood surety for one White of Salisbury on a loan from one Weldon, and put in the Counter, a debtors' prison in Bread Street. The arrest had been effected while Ferrers was on his way to the House of Commons, and Ferrers' fellow members ordered the Serjeant-at-Arms to obtain Ferrers' release. According to Holinshed:
there ensued a fray within the Counter gates between Ferrers and the officers, not without hurt of either part, so that the serjeant was driven to defend himself with his mace of arms, and had the crown thereof broken off by bearing off a stroke, and his man struck down.
The two sheriffs of London arrived, but when the Serjeant demanded Ferrers' release, the sheriffs, according to Holinshed, treated the request "contemptuously, with many proud words".
Weldon, the creditor who had instigated the arrest, and the two sheriffs and others were then summoned before the Commons on 28 March 1542 to answer charges of breach of parliamentary privilege, and were committed to the Tower for two days. The matter was referred to the Privy Council, and the King claimed privilege for his servants' attendance upon the business of parliament, stating that:
We be informed by our judges that we at no time stand so highly in our estate royal as in the time of Parliament, wherein we as head and you as members are conjoined and knit together into one body politic, so that whatsoever offence or injury during that time is offered to the meanest members of the House is to be judged as done against our person and the whole court of Parliament.
The incident thus established the immunity of members of the Commons from civil arrest while the House was in session.
Later career and work in entertainment.
During the Scottish campaign of 1547 Ferrers was a commissioner of transport, and is described by William Patten in "The Late Expedition in Scotland" as being at the time 'a gentleman of my lord Protectors'. Ferrers survived Somerset's downfall in October 1549 and execution in January 1552, and was appointed by the Duke of Northumberland to devise entertainments to amuse the young King Edward VI during the Christmas season of 1551–2. The then Master of the Revels, Sir Thomas Cawarden (a former fellow page of the chamber with Ferrers), was told by Northumberland to assist Ferrers. Material relating to the preparation of the entertainments is in the Revels accounts in the Loseley manuscripts (now in the Folger Shakespeare Library). The Acts of the Privy Council record that Northumberland paid Ferrers £50, and that the entire entertainment cost about £500. Ferrers is reported by the chronicler Richard Grafton to have outdone his predecessors:
in shew of sundry sightes and devises of rare invention, and in act of divers enterludes and matters of pastime, played by persons, as not onely satisfied the common sorte, but also were very well liked and allowed by the counsayle and other of skill in the like pastimes.
Ferrers was reappointed as Lord of Misrule to devise entertainments during the 1552-1553 Christmas season, and as in the previous year there were jousting, a mock midsummer show, a visit to the city of London, and various masques, and on Twelfth Night a triumph of Cupid, Venus, and Mars, devised by Sir George Howard, Master of the Henchmen, and produced by Ferrers. Ferrers was rewarded by a grant of an estate at Flamstead. He was again reappointed during the Christmas season of 1553–4 by the new Queen, Mary I.
Involvement in Wyatt's Rebellion and with John Dee.
In 1554 Ferrers was awarded £100 for services during Wyatt's rebellion.
In spring and early summer 1555 Ferrers, with John Prideaux, accused John Dee and his associates, including Sir Thomas Benger, of conjuring, casting nativities, plotting on behalf of Princess Elizabeth against King Philip and Queen Mary, and bewitching Ferrers's children. On or about 26 May 1555 Dee was arrested, and he and his associates were later imprisoned. On 4 June the Privy Council sought information concerning Ferrers's own whereabouts. After this incident there is little trace of Ferrers, and no record that he was at court during Queen Elizabeth's reign, although he was appointed escheator for Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire in 1562–3 and for Essex and Hertfordshire in 1566–7.
Literary career and last years.
According to Woudhuysen, 'William Baldwin was instrumental in the creation of Ferrers's largest surviving literary work, his contributions to "The Mirror for Magistrates", in which he was also associated with Sir Thomas Chaloner and Thomas Phaer'. Woudhuysen conjectures that Ferrers wrote several pieces for a suppressed edition of "The Mirror for Magistrates" published about 1554 which survives only in fragments. The 1559 edition includes his tragedies of Tresilian and Thomas of Woodstock, but his other contributions were suppressed in that edition, and not printed until several years later.
According to John Stow, Ferrers wrote the part of Richard Grafton's "Chronicle" (1568–9) dealing with the reign of Queen Mary, an allegation which Grafton denied, but Stow insisted upon. Stow and Grafton were in dispute, as Grafton had plagiarised part of Stow's own chronicle history of England. Bindoff states that Ferrers "almost certainly wrote a number of masques and plays for performance at court and elsewhere" which are lost. Ferrers also contributed verses to Leicester's lavish entertainment of Queen Elizabeth at Kenilworth Castle in July 1575.
Confusion concerning Ferrers' literary career was engendered in 1589 by the author of "The Arte of English Poesie" (thought to be George Puttenham), who in comparing Ferrers to other poets of the reign of Edward VI stated that he was "the principal man in this profession", and in relation to the others "a man of no less mirth &amp; felicity … but of much more skill, &amp; magnificence in his meter, and therefore wrate for the most part to the stage, in Tragedy and sometimes in Comedy or Interlude, wherein he gave the king so much good recreation, as he had thereby many good rewards". Puttenham later praised Lord Buckhurst and Ferrers "for tragedy", saying that "for such doings as I have seen of theirs [they] do deserve the highest praise". Unfortunately in both statements Puttenham erroneously gave Ferrers the first name Edward, spelling his name "Edward Ferrys". This misidentification was copied by Francis Meres in his "Palladis Tamia" in 1598, and repeated by later historians and literary critics until corrected by Sir Sidney Lee in the Dictionary of National Biography.
Little is known of Ferrers' last years. Ferrers had been a member of Parliament for several constituencies during the years 1542–1555, and in 1571 he was returned for St Albans. He is said to have supported the claim to the succession of Mary, Queen of Scots, and to have corresponded with her agent in England, John Lesley, Bishop of Ross. Ferrers died at Flamstead in Hertfordshire, and was buried there on 11 January 1579.
Marriages and issue.
Ferrers' first wife was Elizabeth, the widow of his friend Humphrey Bourchier (d.1540), whom he married by 10 December 1541. On 29 July 1548 he obtained the reversion of her right to the lease of Markyate Priory. His second wife was Jane, the daughter of John Southcote of St Albans, whom he married by licence dated 5 March 1546, and with whom he had a son, Julius. Ferrers married, as his third wife, by licence dated 29 November 1569, Margaret Preston, by whom he had at least three other sons and two daughters.

In a conventional finite-state machine, the transition is associated with a set of input Boolean conditions and a set of output Boolean functions. In an extended finite-state machine (EFSM) model, the transition can be expressed by an “if statement” consisting of a set of trigger conditions. If trigger conditions are all satisfied, the transition is fired, bringing the machine from the current state to the next state and performing the specified data operations.

Next (Crichton novel)

Next is a 2006 satirical science fiction novel by American writer Michael Crichton. It was the fifteenth novel under his own name and his twenty-fifth overall, and the last to be published during his lifetime. It follows a number of characters, including transgenic animals, as they try to survive in a world dominated by genetic research, corporate greed, and legal interventions.
Plot summary.
Frank Burnet has contracted an aggressive form of leukemia, and undergoes intensive treatment and four years of semiannual checkups. He later learned the checkups were a pretext for researching the genetic basis of his unusually successful response to treatment, and the physician's university had sold the rights to Frank's cells to BioGen, a biotechnology startup company. Frank sues the university for unauthorized misuse of his cells, but the trial judge rules that the cells were "waste" and that the university could dispose of them as it wished. Frank's lawyers advise that the university, as a tax-funded organization, can still claim the rights to the cells under the doctrine of eminent domain.
Venture capitalist "Jack" Watson conspires to steal or sabotage BioGen's cultures of Frank's cells. As part of his terms for financing BioGen, Watson forced the company to accept his nephew Brad Gordon as its security chief. After Brad's carelessness nearly allows one of Watson's sabotage attempts to succeed, the company takes advantage of Brad's attraction to teenage girls, and engineers his being accused and convicted of raping a minor. Watson's price for providing a defense lawyer is that Brad must contaminate BioGen's cultures. Brad's lawyer plans to claim in defense that Brad has a gene for recklessness and instructs him to engage in various high-risk activities. As a result, Brad gets into a fight with two martial arts experts and is shot by the police.
After Brad's sabotage, BioGen consults lawyers, who advise that under United States law they have the rights to all of Frank's cell line and thus the right to extract replacement cells, by force if necessary, from Frank or any of his descendants. When Frank goes on the run, BioGen hires bounty hunter Vasco Borden to obtain such cells, regardless of whether the donors consent. Vasco plans to snatch Frank's grandson Jamie from his school but is foiled by Jamie's mother Alex, whom he tries to seize instead. After escaping, Alex and Jamie also go on the run.
Henry Kendall, a researcher at another biotech company, finds that his illegal introduction of human genes into a chimpanzee years before while working at the NIH primate research facility unexpectedly produced a transgenic chimpanzee, who can talk and whose behavior is generally childlike but reverts to chimpanzee patterns under stress. The agency intends to destroy the chimp-boy, Dave, in order to cover up the unauthorized experiment, but Henry sneaks him out of the lab. Henry's wife Lynn opposes bringing Dave into their home, but their son, also named Jamie, becomes close friends with him. Lynn becomes Dave's most determined defender and, to explain Dave's odd appearance, publishes online reports of a fictitious genetic disease. She grooms him as a senior female would groom a young chimpanzee in the wild. Dave is sent to the same school as Jamie and gets into trouble after biting the leader of a gang of bullies who attack Jamie. The chimp-boy becomes increasingly isolated at school; academically, he is backward in some areas such as writing, while in sports, his classmates regard him as unfair competition.
Paris-based animal behavior researcher Gail Bond finds that her two-year-old grey parrot, Gerard, into which human genes were injected while he was a chick, has been helping her son produce near-perfect homework. While she is testing Gerard's abilities, the bird becomes bored and mimics the voices and other sounds of her husband having sex in their home with another woman. After a quarrel, Gail's husband, an investment banker, gives Gerard as a "money can't buy this" present to an influential and lecherous client. The client finds Gerard an embarrassment and passes him on to another owner, and so on. Eventually, Gerard ends up in the hands of Stan Milgram, who loses patience with Gerard's loquacity while delivering the parrot to yet another owner three days' drive away and leaves the bird by the roadside. Gerard flies off, in search of more pleasant surroundings.
After a few more narrow escapes, Alex and Jamie head for the home of Lynn, who happens to be a childhood friend. Vasco anticipates this move and tries to snatch Jamie – but abducts Lynn's son Jamie instead. Dave saves Lynn's Jamie, biting off Vasco's ear and damaging the ambulance in which Vasco planned to extract the tissue samples. However, Vasco's associate snatches Alex's son while everyone is celebrating the rescue of Lynn's. While the hunt is going on, Biogen's lawyers apply for a warrant to arrest Alex, on the grounds that she had stolen the company's property, namely her and her son's cells. She has to go straight from the fight to the courtroom, where her lawyer outplays Biogen's, and the judge adjourns to check details of the relevant laws and precedents overnight. Alex and Henry discover that Alex's son is being moved to a private clinic where the tissue samples are to be taken. As they move in to retrieve him, Gerard, now a resident of the clinic's gardens, reminds Jamie to shout for his mother, who rescues him. Vasco gives up after Dave attacks him, and Alex threatens him with a shotgun. The next day the judge rules in Alex's favor and rejects the precedents as attempts to abolish normal human feelings by decree, a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids slavery. The ruling will likely hamper research in the long run, and prevent patients from selling their tissues rather than donating them for research.
Gerard is welcomed into Lynn's home. After he mimics telephone dial tones Lynn contacts Gail, and he is reunited with her. Press commentators praise the household as a trend-setting inter-species transgenic family, and Henry is honored by some scientific organizations.
In other plot threads:
The book also features news reports, many about the genetics of blondes and of Neanderthals. These two themes combine into reports that Neanderthals were the first blondes, were more intelligent than Cro-Magnon humans and interbred with Cro-Magnons out of pity, and that "cavemen preferred blondes". At one point three successive reports feature a scientist's press release that Neanderthals had a gene that made them both behaviorally conservative and ecologically conservationist, an environmentalist's interpretation of that press release that modern humans need to learn from the Neanderthals lest they too become extinct, and a business columnist's interpretation that over-caution caused the Neanderthals' extinction.
Reception.
Book reviews.
The review aggregator web site Metacritic gives "Next" a score of 48%, meaning "mixed or average reviews". "USA Today" said Crichton was "in top form". "The Independent" said that ""Next" is middling Crichton, perhaps because it lacks the simple suspense situation around which most of his books are constructed." "The London Review of Books" called it "an unintentionally hilarious emulsion of bombast and bathos", "The Washington Post" described it as "part lecture, part satire and mostly freak show", and Dave Itzkoff in "The New York Times"′s Sunday Book Review called it "a barrage of truths, half-truths and untruths".
Award-winning science journalist Matt Ridley, writing in "The Wall Street Journal", often could not spot the boundary between fact and fiction in the scientific aspects, although he found the almost immediate effects of the "maturity" gene implausible. He also thought that Crichton's "uncanny prescience in choosing subjects where fact will soon catch up with his fiction" was on target again, as the early hype over biotechnology has subsided and recent advances offer credible benefits.
In "The Sunday Times" Joby Williams called the book "more a satiric polemic than the thriller we have come to expect from Crichton", and notes that there is no central character and the story is told as a collection of distinct episodes. Ridley described the plot as "a collection of short horror stories from the biotechnology industry," and "The Independent"′s view was similar. "The Washington Post" and "The A.V. Club" concluded that Crichton tried to cram too much into the book and would have preferred a storyline that focussed on Dave the chimp-boy and Gerard the talkative parrot. "Entertainment Weekly" complained that it was hard to track over 30 named characters through intersecting sub-plots. However "USA Today"′s reviewer liked the story's brisk pace and thought the interleaved plot threads came together well at the end.
The "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"'s Karen Carlin enjoyed the novel highly and said "You realize what he's fictionalizing could be happening now, not 'Next.' And that's what makes it all so terrifying."
Opinions about the characters ranged from "dislikable and indistinguishable" to "deliciously vivid". "The Onion A.V. Club" thought the characters were barely developed enough to support the dialog and plot, and Ridley commented that in real life "most biotech executives are stressed and insecure people with mortgages" rather than sybaritic super-villains. However reviewers liked Gerard and Dave.
Some reviewers welcomed the injection of humor into the book, noting the parodies of stereotypes, and Ridley regarded much of the story as a farce. However others thought most of the humor was unintentional.
The novel has also attracted (mostly negative) commentary from legal reviewers.
Sales.
"Next" placed fourth in "Publishers Weekly"s hardback fiction bestseller list for the year 2006, and in December 2007 it reached third place in "Publishers Weekly"s weekly paperback fiction bestseller list.
In mid-December 2006 "Next" reached ninth place in a United Kingdom hardback fiction bestseller list.
Political impact.
The biotechnology industry magazine "Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News" complained about the array of stereotyped corporate villains, and described Crichton's arguments against gene patents and commercial ownership of genes as "the usual suspects". Although it hoped poor reviews would reduce the book's impact, it noted that two Congressmen introduced a bill to ban future gene patents and abolish existing ones. Writers on technology-related law suggested "Next" and Crichton's opinion article in "The New York Times" may have been partly responsible for this bill. Public interest in gene patents had previously been declining, and gene-only patent applications were becoming less frequent as the industry realized how much work is needed to turn a gene into a salable product.
Character name controversy.
Michael Crowley of "The New Republic" alleged that, in retaliation for his having written a negative review of Crichton's previous novel "State of Fear", Crichton named a character with a small penis who rapes a baby after him. From page 227: "Alex Burnet was in the middle of the most difficult trial of her career, a rape case involving the sexual assault of a two-year-old boy in Malibu. The defendant, thirty-year-old Mick Crowley, was a Washington-based political columnist who was visiting his sister-in-law when he experienced an overwhelming urge to have anal sex with her young son, still in diapers." Both the real and the fictional Crowley are Washington-based political columnists who had graduated from Yale.

Ricci and the writer Michael Bedard created picture book editions of literary fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen, namely "The Nightingale" and "The Tinder Box" (1835 and 1843, Danish language). They won the annual IODE Ontario Children's Book Award (now Jean Thorp Award) for "The Nightingale" in 1991.
Ricci's earliest book listed in the WorldCat catalogue is "The Lightning Bolt", another picture book written by Bedard, which was published by Oxford University Press in 1989.
"The Market Wedding" (2000), written by Cary Fagan, is "based on an old Yiddish tale". It was a runner-up for the Sydney Taylor Book Award and Ricci was one of five nominees for the Governor General's Award in children's literature illustration that year.

Ignicoccus

Ignicoccus is a genus of hyperthermophillic Archaea living in marine hydrothermal vents. They were discovered in samples taken at the Kolbeinsey Ridge north of Iceland, as well as at the East Pacific Rise (at 9 degrees N, 104 degrees W) in 2000.
Systematics.
According to the comparisons of 16S rRNA genes, "Ignicoccus" represents a new, deeply branching lineage within the family of the Desulfurococcaceae.
Three species are known: "I. islandicus", "I. pacificus" and "I. hospitalis" strain KIN4I.
Cell structure.
The archaea of the genus "Ignicoccus" have tiny coccoid cells with a diameter of about 2 μm, that exhibit a smooth surface, an outer membrane and no S-layer.
They have a previously unknown cell envelope structure—a cytoplasmic membrane, a periplasmic space (with a variable width of 20 to 400 nm, containing membrane-bound vesicles), and an outer membrane (approximately 10 nm wide, resembling the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria). The latter contains numerous tightly, irregularly packed single particles (about 8 nm in diameter) and pores with a diameter of 24 nm, surrounded by tiny particles, arranged in a ring (with a diameter of 130 nm) and clusters of up to eight particles 12 nm in diameter each.
The two layers of membrane previously reported are actually a type of endomembrane system consisting of cytoplasmic protrusions. In "I. hospitalis", these structures harbor the endosymbiotic archaeon "Nanoarchaeum equitans".
Physiology.
"Ignicocci" live in a temperature range of 70–98 °C (optimum around 90 °C). They gain energy by reduction of elemental sulfur to hydrogen sulfide using molecular hydrogen as the electron donor. A unique symbiosis with (or parasitism by) "Nanoarchaeum equitans" has also been reported.
Phylogeny.
The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)

<doc id="6965276" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6965276" title="Polyetherimide">
Polyetherimide

Polyetherimide (PEI; branded as Ultem) is an amorphous, amber-to-transparent thermoplastic with characteristics similar to the related plastic PEEK. When comparing PEI to PEEK, the former is cheaper but has lower impact strength and a tighter temperature range.
PEI plastics were first introduced into the market by General Electric (GE) in 1982 under the trade name Ultem resulting from the work of J.G. Wirth's research team in the early 1970s.
Due to its adhesive properties and chemical stability it became a popular bed material for FFF 3D printers.
Structure.
The molecular formula of the PEI repeating unit is and the molecular weight is 592.61 g/mol. It contains phthalimide and bisphenol A sub-units.
Properties.
The glass transition temperature of PEI is 217 °C (422 °F). Its amorphous density at 25 °C is 1.27 g/cm3(.046 lb/in³). It is prone to stress cracking in chlorinated solvents. Polyetherimide is able to resist high temperatures while maintaining stable electrical properties over a wide range of frequencies. This high strength material offers excellent chemical resistance and ductile properties suitable for various applications, even those involving steam exposure.
Production.
PEIs are manufactured by the imidization reaction of a flexible dianhydride and m-Phenylenediamine.

Electricity (Elton John song)

"Electricity" is a song composed by English musician Elton John and Lee Hall for "Billy Elliot the Musical". Released on 11 July 2005, it became John's 63rd UK top-40 hit, peaking at number four on the UK Singles Chart. Discounting "Step into Christmas", it is his most recent solo top-40 hit in the UK. The song was included as a bonus track on the UK re-issue of Elton's album "Peachtree Road".
Background.
The song is sung by Billy Elliot in the stage production at his audition for a place at The Royal Ballet School in London. Billy is asked "What does it feel like, when you are dancing?" by one of the panel. Billy responds, hesitantly at first, "I can't really explain it... I haven't got the words..." And then (see full lyrics) the music takes hold, and he goes into an energetic song, describing dancing as "Something that you can't control". After two verses, each with a chorus, Billy leaps into a frenetic dance; in this dance, many skills such as acrobatics are used (the rhythm for this section of the instrumental varies from Billy to Billy, depending on each actor's dance strengths). The number concludes with another verse and Billy doing several pirouettes or tumbles.
The most notable lyric in this piece is that of the title: 'Electricity sparks inside of me and I'm free, I'm free!" It was inspired by the scene in the film, which it follows closely, in which Billy describes dancing as "Electricity". His passion, shown in his description, is the implied reason for Billy's acceptance into The Royal Ballet School.

Newbury Park, London

Newbury Park is an area of Ilford in East London situated in the London Borough of Redbridge east of Gants Hill. The main road is the Eastern Avenue (A12), which until the 1920s was a country lane called "Hatch Lane". The main landmark in this area is the tube station whose post-war bus shelter received a Festival of Britain award in 1951. The shelter was designed by architect Oliver Hill in 1937.
History.
The name "Newbury" was first recorded in 1348. The area, along with the rest of Ilford, was part of the county of Essex until 1965, when the new borough became a part of Greater London.
The station was originally opened by the Great Eastern Railway in 1903 on the Fairlop Loop, before being transferred to the London Underground in 1947, and partially rebuilt, but the planned complete re-building has been suspended to this day. Steam services southward to Ilford railway station ceased at this time, the track being lifted by 1956. Central line tube services now burrow underground and swing sharply west towards Gants Hill, Leytonstone and central London.
At one time, it had two hospitals: the King George V and Ilford Maternity Hospital. They have both been demolished and replaced by blocks of flats, while a new hospital called King George V has been built further east in Little Heath.
Religion.
According to the 2021 Census data for Newbury Park (Lower Layer Super Output Area E02000767), the religious composition of the area is as follows: Christian: 2,399 individuals (approximately 27.8%), Muslim: 2,229 individuals (approximately 25.8%), Hindu: 2,091 individuals (approximately 24.2%), Sikh: 341 individuals (approximately 4.0%), Jewish: 296 individuals (approximately 3.4%), No religion: 600 individuals (approximately 7.0%), Other religions: 125 individuals (approximately 1.4%), Religion not stated: 496 individuals (approximately 5.7%) 
The area has two synagogues: a constituent of the United Synagogue (orthodox), and the South West Essex Reform Jewish synagogue. A third synagogue, the Barkingside Progressive Synagogue, is, despite its name, also in Newbury Park. The area also has a number of Churches such as the Catholic Church St. Teresa's near the station. Newbury Park is also home to the Newbury Park Mosque, located on Oaks Lane. The mosque serves the local Muslim community and can accommodate up to 400 worshippers. It offers regular daily prayers, Friday congregational prayers, and educational classes for both children and adults.
Transport.
The nearest London Underground station is Newbury Park on the Central line.
Geography.
Nearby places are Aldborough Hatch, Barkingside, Gants Hill, Goodmayes, Seven Kings and Ilford's town centre. The A12 road runs through Newbury Park and a shopping complex lies near the Eastern Avenue / Horns Road junction. Stores include Aldi, Pets at Home, B&amp;Q and a Lidl.
Education.
Nearby schools include Valentines High School and recently opened Seven Kings Primary attached to Seven Kings High School. Newbury Park Primary School is on Perrymans Farm Road, opening in 1904 as the Horns Elementary School. William Torbitt Primary is on Eastern Avenue. The Oaks Park High School, at the eastern end of Perrymans Farm Road, opened in 2001.

The Gray Nun of Belgium

The Gray Nun of Belgium was a 1915 film announced for release on the Alliance Program by Dramatic Feature Films, Frank Joslyn Baum's short-lived successor to The Oz Film Manufacturing Company.
Despite the advertising in "Motion Picture News" announcing its release date, Katharine Rogers, in "L. Frank Baum: Creator of Oz", believes that Alliance found the film inferior and refused to distribute it. The exhibition copy, which may have been a work print, may have been the only copy ever struck. Baum himself thought that exchanges and exhibitors dismissed the film "rather arbitrarily" based on the Oz Company name.
In the film, Betty Pierce played a Mother Superior who aided Allied soldiers during World War I. Cathrine Countiss played the title role. It also starred David Proctor, Mae Wells, Katherine Griffith, Raymond Russell, Robert Dunbar, Harry Clements, and James Spencer. Wells and Russell were prominent actors in the Oz Company, having played roles such as Mombi and Dr. Pipt, respectively.

Lana Crawford

Lana Crawford is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera "Neighbours", played by Bridget Neval. The actress's casting was announced in June 2004, and she stated that she was excited to take on the role of Lana, a schoolgirl and the serial's first lesbian character. Neval explained that Lana's sexuality did not bother her, but she hoped her story would not be told in a sensationalist or distasteful way. Neval made her first screen appearance as Lana during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2004 and departed on 13 January 2005. Despite being retired from acting, Neval agreed to reprise the role for the show's 35th anniversary celebrations, which saw Lana marry Sky.
Lana was introduced as a high school student, who has been closeted due to homophobic bullying at her previous school. Upon moving to Erinsborough, Lana befriends Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher) and Serena's cousin Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh), whom she develops a crush on. The storyline between Lana and Sky was billed as a relationship story between two close female friends, "made compelling by the complexity of the feelings involved." Lana and Sky's friendship eventually culminated in "Neighbours"' first lesbian kiss.
The episode featuring the kiss was broadcast in the serial's regular G-rated timeslot and gave "Neighbours" a small increase in ratings. However, it led talkback callers and conservative groups to attack the storyline and the characters. Writers for AfterEllen and the "Sydney Star Observer" branded the storyline "a real television advance" and praised Lana and her journey. The show's executive producer, Ric Pellizzeri, believed the storyline reflected reality and some viewers said that it had had a "profound effect" on them.
Casting.
In June 2004, Pete Timbs of "TV Week" reported "Wicked Science" actress Bridget Neval had joined the cast of "Neighbours" as Lana Crawford. Timbs revealed that Lana was a schoolgirl set to "liven things up among the Ramsay Street teenagers as she comes to terms with her sexuality." Neval told Timbs' colleague Helen Vnuk that she was initially taken aback when she learned of the character she might be asked to play. However, she was very excited to take on the role of Lana, calling her "a fantastic character".
Neval later explained "My initial reaction to the part was surprise as "Neighbours" have never had a gay character. But the nature of the character never really bothered me. My only real concern was that the story would not be told in a sensationalist or distasteful way. She's not a stereotypical character and being gay is certainly not the only interesting thing about her." Neval made her first screen appearance as Lana during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2004. In April 2005, Eliza Taylor-Cotter said that she had originally auditioned for the role of Lana, before joining the cast as Janae Timmins.
Development.
Lana was introduced as "Neighbours"' first lesbian character. Neval revealed that while Lana would fuel a storyline for established character Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh), she would also go through her own journey. A representative from Grundy Television explained that the storyline would be "a relationship story of a close female friendship, made compelling by the complexity of the feelings involved." The representative believed the storyline would "strike a chord" with teenage viewers, who could relate to Sky and Lana's feelings. Scriptwriter Helen MacWhirter also stated that Lana's story is "multi-faceted", saying, "On one level it's about a young girl coming to terms with her sexuality, which on its own might have been a bit boring and gratuitous, but it also brought into play other story strands which added depth and dimension."
Lana was a "pretty" Canadian high school student. She left her old high school due to homophobic bullying, and as a result she became "very closeted". Describing the character, Natasha Norton from AfterEllen stated "She comes across at first as a touch flighty, as if she can't quite make up her mind as to who she wants to be, but it soon becomes abundantly clear that Lana's carefully constructed façade has a purpose." Following her arrival in Erinsborough, Lana befriended Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). They both learned that they had been taken advantage of by "sleazy" photographer Chris Cousens (Simon Mallory). Serena's cousin, Sky, took an instant dislike to Lana. Sky had learned that Lana had flirted with her boyfriend, leaving her "less than impressed". During a game of basketball, Sky began feuding with Lana, and they started a brawl on the court. Of filming the fight, Neval stated, "We wanted to make it look spontaneous, and really gritty and brawly. It was a lot of fun learning how to choreograph a fight and how to be aware of the other actor and not actually hurt them."
After being placed in detention together, Lana and Sky came to know each other better. They gradually formed a bond, and Lana developed feelings for Sky. Lana's crush on Sky eventually culminated in "Neighbours"' first lesbian kiss. The episode featuring the kiss was broadcast in its usual 6.30pm G-rated timeslot. The executive producer of "Neighbours", Ric Pellizzeri, said the storyline reflected reality and continued the show's move toward more contemporary issues. Pellizzeri explained that "Neighbours" was simply telling "a story about tolerance." The producer added that the kiss was as far as they would go, but the writers would not be discouraged from telling other stories about homosexuality in the future. On-screen, Sky told Lana that she was only interested in her boyfriend, but they remained friends. With her main storyline completed, Lana was seen attending the prom with a female admirer, before moving to Canada with her family. Script producer Luke Devenish told a reporter for the "Sydney Star Observer", "There is that great tradition that the lesbian is always dead in the final scene, and we were very aware of that as we were writing her out. We wanted to avoid that at all costs."
On 13 December 2019, it was announced that Neval had reprised the role for the serial's 35th anniversary celebrations in March 2020. In a post to her Instagram account, Neval explained that she had retired from acting, but she could not refuse a request from series producer Jason Herbison to return, after learning that Lana would be reunited with Sky. The characters will marry upon their return to Erinsborough, having reconnected off-screen.
Storylines.
Lana is Sindi (Marisa Warrington) and Penny Watts' (Andrea McEwan) cousin. She was born in Australia, but her family moved to Canada when she was young. They returned to Australia a few years later, and Lana began attending Wattle Heights High School, where she was bullied over her sexuality. This led her to transfer to Erinsborough High. Lana finds employment at the Coffee Shop alongside Serena Bishop, whom she befriends. Lana is convinced that she had seen Serena before, and she realises that Serena had been in some photos taken by dodgy photographer Chris Cousens. Lana admits to Serena that she had also been taken in by Chris and that she was not over it. Lana did not get on with Serena's cousin, Sky, and one day they fight at school. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) places them in detention and urges them to work things out.
Sky and Lana start to trust each other a little, and during a sleepover organised by Serena, they discover that they both like black and white films. They bond, and Lana later watches Sky fall asleep. Sky realises that Lana has hidden depths and tells her. Lana gets upset and tells Sky that she is not hiding anything. Sky calls a friend who attended Wattle Heights High with Lana and finds out about the bullying that caused Lana to change schools. During a playfight at a sleepover, Lana suddenly kisses Sky. She runs out of the house and goes to the Coffee Shop, where she finds Sindi. Lana reveals to Sindi that she is gay. Lana admits that she does not want to lose Sky as a friend and tries to pass the kiss off as a joke. Sky tells Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh) about the kiss, and Lana is later outed at school.
Lana attempts to convince everyone that it is just a rumour by dating Brendan Bond (Michael Wahr). When Sky finds out that Lana is planning to have sex with Brendan during a party, Sky tries to stop her. Lana tells Sky to leave, but then decides to tell Brendan that she cannot have sex with him because she likes girls. Lana receives anonymous notes in her locker praising her for being brave. However, she is also targeted by a gang of girls who threaten to cut her hair off. Susan decides to get the school involved in a tolerance campaign, but many of the parents protest about it. Sky and Lana begin drawing a cartoon strip together called "Freak Girl and The Enigma" and Buffy Only (Laura Gordon), the editor of a gay magazine, becomes interested in publishing it. Buffy later asks Lana out on a date, but comes to realise that they are not right for each other.
Sky and Lana decide to plant lavender outside Lassiter's Hotel, and they stay to watch everyone's reactions. During her excitement, Sky kisses Lana, who is delighted as she believes Sky has fallen for her. Sky explains to Lana that they can only be friends, and Lana accuses Sky of using her. Lana avoids Sky for several days, but they eventually make up. Lana finds a note in her locker from someone named George, asking her to the end-of-year formal dance. During the formal, "George" introduces herself as Georgina Harris (Adrienne Smith), and she and Lana spend the rest of the night together. Lana decides to return to Canada, and her friends throw her a farewell party. Sky tells Lana that she will miss her and gives her a pen, so she can start writing her own novel. Lana says goodbye to George, and Lana's friends watch as Lana leaves Ramsay Street in a taxi.
Lana returns to Erinsborough fifteen years later to join Sky. They reveal to Sky's family that they reconnected about six months ago and are getting married at the Lassiters Wedding Expo, but only after Sky informs her former partner Dylan Timmins (Damien Bodie). Dylan arrives the following day and eventually gives his blessing, but Sky wants to cancel the wedding after their venue is ruined. Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) arranges for them to marry at The 82, a former tram turned restaurant. Sky and Lana are married by Jack Callahan (Andrew Morley). Sky stays in Erinsborough for work, while Lana leaves for a book tour.
Reception.
Shortly after the episode featuring the kiss was aired, the characters were attacked by talkback callers and conservative groups who thought that they had been "glamorising a high-risk culture" and "making homosexuality look cool". Chief executive of the Christian group Salt Shakers, Peter Stokes, told "The Age's" Kenneth Nguyen, "It just saddens me that we give our young people the message that these relationships are OK." However, Ray Misson, the head of Melbourne University's arts education department, described the serial's depiction of a lesbian as "a real advance." Neval believed that gay teenagers, who were already feeling insecure about how their sexuality would be accepted, would be devastated by the negative reaction surrounding the storyline.
On the reaction the kiss between Lana and Sky received, Natasha Norton from AfterEllen stated, "From the amount of backlash this kiss generated in Australia, you'd think that they'd shown a full blown love scene; newspapers have been full of angry letters to the editor decrying the gay storyline. The negative reaction by many in the Australia press mirrors Lana's current storyline on "Neighbours", which explores the backlash Lana experiences when her sexuality becomes public knowledge at her high school." Norton's colleague, Malinda Lo, later said that many of the website's readers said Lana's storyline had a "profound effect" on them when they were teenagers. A writer from GayNZ.com noted that the episode featuring the kiss was broadcast unedited and provided "Neighbours" with a modest ratings increase.
Bill Muehlenberg from Australian Family Association believed Lana's introduction and storyline was just an attempt to increase ratings. A "Sydney Star Observer" reporter praised Lana's cousin, Sindi, for being sympathetic and reacting in a positive way when Lana came out to her. The reporter also praised Sky's reaction for being "more let's talk about it than get away from me, you lezzo freak", while adding that it seemed "Neighbours" had wanted Lana to be a "sympathetic gay character", which must have upset the Christian groups. Of Lana's storyline, a writer for AfterEllen stated, "The significance of this depiction was that it occurred in a relatively conservative, family-oriented show with a large child viewership, and all the major sympathetic characters were presented as supportive of Lana's sexuality, with the bullies being depicted as villains."
In his book "Neighbours: 20 years of Ramsay Street", Tony Johnston wrote, "Vilified by ultra-conservative groups and celebrated by the gay press, the kiss helped to redefine "Neighbours" as it entered its third decade." In July 2007, the "Herald Sun" asked readers to vote for their top ten "Neighbours" moments. Lana and Sky's kiss came in at number nine, and a reporter for the paper said "It's rare that "Neighbours" attracts the attention of the shock jocks around the country, but that's what happened when Sky Bishop, played by Stephanie McIntosh, gave Lana, played by Bridget Neval, a kiss. Sky was exploring her sexuality and the scene was one of the most talked about ever in the press. Lana left Erinsborough and Sky has gone on to be an unmarried mum".

Ian Handysides

Ian Robert Handysides (14 December 1962 – 17 August 1990) was an English footballer.
Handysides was born in Jarrow. He began his footballing career when he joined Birmingham City on leaving school in 1979. A year later he made his first-team debut as a midfielder and by 1982 was a regular player in Birmingham's First Division side. By the turn of 1984, he had lost his place in the first team and was transferred to Walsall (in the Third Division) in hope of getting more first-team chances. He was a regular player for Walsall and within two years of joining, he returned to Birmingham.
In the autumn of 1986, Handysides was loaned out to Wolverhampton Wanderers and scored twice in 11 Fourth Division fixtures. On his return to Birmingham, he quickly re-established himself as a first-team regular and made 30 appearances in the 1987-88 Second Division campaign, scoring three goals, as he helped the club avoid relegation.
In the autumn of 1988, Handysides was diagnosed with a brain tumour. After a course of chemotherapy, he appeared to be recovering well, however this then spread to his spine and he died in Solihull on 17 August 1990, when still only 27 years old.

TK85

The TK85 was a ZX81 clone made by Microdigital Eletrônica, a computer company located in Brazil. It came with 16 or 48 KB RAM, and had a ZX Spectrum–style case, similar to a "Timex Sinclair 1500".
Unlike the ZX81, the TK85 used standard logic components rather than a gate array ("ULA"), and during manufacture several of them were scraped so that competitors couldn't easily copy the circuit. The circuit board had space for a AY-3-8912 sound generator chip (compatible with the "ZonX-81" sound board), and although none came factory installed, it is possible to add the necessary circuits.
The TK85 came with a copy of the 8K ZX81 floating point BASIC, and an additional 2K EPROM, mapped to addresses 8192-10240, containing machine code routines for use with tape files. These routines could save with codice_1, load with codice_2 and verify with codice_3 in "Hi-Speed" (4200 bps); save and load, BASIC variables in 300 bps (standard ZX81 speed) using codice_4 and codice_5 functions and 4200 bps (Hi-Speed) using codice_6 and codice_7. These routines were all accessible using codice_8 commands. The save to variable function could be used to make copies of programs on tape.
The expansion port on the back of the computer is compatible with the ZX81, although some peripherals may not work due to conflicts with the 2K of extra ROM.
The rear of the computer featured a TV output (without video back porch), "EAR" and "MIC" sockets for connecting to an external tape recorder, a joystick port using a DIN socket (that simulated the ,, and keys), a ZX81 compatible expansion port, space for a sound output socket, and a socket for the 9V external power supply.
Since the joystick used the cursor keys, and due to the circuitry for the keyboard, it wasn't possible to detect diagonal directions correctly.

River Twiss

The River Twiss is a river in the county of Yorkshire, England. The source of the river is Kingsdale Beck, which rises at Kingsdale Head at the confluence of Back Gill and Long Gill in the Yorkshire Dales. Beneath Keld Head, the river changes its name to the River Twiss. It has two notable waterfalls, Thornton Force and Pecca Falls, and its course follows part of the Ingleton Waterfalls Walk, then through Swilla Glen to Thornton in Lonsdale and down to Ingleton, where it meets the River Doe to form the River Greta.
The English landscape artist J. M. W. Turner was a frequent visitor to the area, and his sketch of Thornton Force in 1816 is currently part of the Tate collection.
Course.
From the caves below Keld Head, water flows and combines with Kingsdale Beck to form the River Twiss. It flows south over Thornton Force and Pecca Falls and through woodland to join the River Doe at Ingleton.
Waterfalls.
The drop of Thornton Force is about . Pecca Falls has three drops totalling that fall into their own deep pools.
Geology.
In its upper part, the river flows through a valley carved into horizontal beds of Carboniferous Great Scar limestone. At Thornton Force, it crosses a notable unconformity into the underlying, steeply inclined Ordovician greywackes. The unconformity is clearly visible in the face of the waterfall. The Ordovician strata influence the character of the steep and narrow Swilla Glen and its waterfalls until, just north of Ingleton, the river crosses the Craven Fault and onto Carboniferous Limestone once again.

Würzburger FV

FV 04 Würzburg is a German association football club from the city of Würzburg, Bavaria founded in 1904 as "1. Würzburger FV 04". The club emerged as "WFV" in 1923 after leaving a short-lived union formed with a gymnastics club.
History.
1904-1981: FV 04 Würzburg.
The team has played as an unheralded local amateur side for most of its existence. From 1927 to 1933, they played in the tier-one "Bezirksliga Bayern". In 1933–34 they spent a single season in the top flight Gauliga Bayern, one of sixteen premier divisions formed in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich in 1933. Towards the end of World War II, "WFV" was forced into a merger with "Kickers Würzburg" to play together as the wartime side (Kriegspielgemeinschaft) "KSG Würzburg". The unified club spent two seasons in last place in the Gauliga Bayern (Gruppe Nord). Play was interrupted as the war progressed and the team was disbanded at the end of the conflict.
"WFV" was re-established after the war and returned to playing anonymously in the lower amateur divisions. It became a permanent fixture in the tier-three Amateurliga Bayern from 1950 onwards. After not qualifying for the new single-division Amateurliga in 1963, the club declined somewhat, spending time in the tier-four Landesliga Bayern-Nord, interrupted by a Bayernliga appearance from 1964 to 1966. In 1970, the club finally returned to the third division more permanently. They broke through to the 2nd Bundesliga Süd 1976 in spite of a second-place finish and a 0:2 playoff loss to "Wacker München" when "Wacker" declined promotion.
"Würzburg"'s four-year-long turn in the second division was a difficult struggle and they were relegated in 1980 after a 21st place finish. Their descent to the Oberliga Bayern (III) ended with another last place finish and was then promptly followed by the financial collapse of the club which owed its creditors over 2.5 million Marks. "WFV" sold its stadium to local rival "DJK Würzburg" to help clear its debt before the club was folded up in May 1981.
1981-2021: Würzburger FV.
The members immediately formed the current club "Würzburger FV" which began play in the depths of the tenth division Kreisklasse C. They have since played their way back to the Oberliga Bayern (IV) where they finished a strong third in 2005–06. During their climb the team earned an appearance in the opening round of the 2001–02 German Cup tournament, but were thrashed 0:10 by then Bundesliga side "1860 Munich".
In the 2007–08 season, the club successfully battled against relegation, finishing 14th. The following season, 2008–09, saw the return of the Würzburg derby after "Kickers Würzburg" gained promotion to the Oberliga. The two clubs had not played against each other at this level since 1981 and have last met in a league game in the 1998–99 season in the Landesliga.
"WFV" experienced a difficult 2008–09 season and had to continue its fight for "Bayernliga" survival in the post-season, having finished on equal points with SV Seligenporten (15th) and TSV Rain am Lech (16th) and therefore requiring a set of deciders to be played. The club lost both games and was relegated back to the Landesliga, alongside "Kickers".
In 2009–10 they took the Landesliga championship and promoted to Oberliga Bayern once more. At the end of the 2011–12 season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new Regionalliga Bayern and advanced to the second round after defeating SpVgg Selbitz convincingly in two games. In this round the club went out to SV Heimstetten on away goals after losing 1–0 in Heimstetten and winning 2–1 at home, thereby remaining in the Bayernliga. The club also missed out on a chance to play on the same level again with local rival Würzburger Kickers, who achieved promotion to the Regionalliga after a Landesliga championship.
Since October 2021: FV 04 Würzburg.
After a merger with "Würzburger Förderverein 04 e.V" the club took back its traditional name "FV 04 Würzburg".

Vytautas Magnus University Education Academy

Vytautas Magnus University Education Academy () – an academical unit of Vytautas Magnus University, which specialized in preparing school teachers and other educators. Located in Vilnius and Kaunas, Lithuania.
History.
The first pedagogical institution in Lithuania was established in Klaipėda in 1935 by the Lithuanian government and was called the "National Pedagogical Institute". After the Nazi Germany ultimatum to Lithuania in March 1939, the Nazis took control of the Klaipėda Region. The institute was moved to Panevėžys. After Lithuania regained portions of the Vilnius Region, the institution was moved to Vilnius in the autumn of 1939. It was renamed to "Vilnius Pedagogical Institute (Vilniaus pedagoginis institutas)".
In 1940, due to the Soviet invasion and occupation, teacher training was reformed according to Soviet standards which affected VPI as the number of students increased due to the changes. After Lithuania regained independence in 1990, the Institute was given the title of a university by the Supreme Council of the Republic Lithuania on 20 May 1992 and reformed into "Vilnius Pedagogical University". In October 2011 the university was renamed to Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences.
From January 2019, the university became an integral part of the Vytautas Magnus University as the Education Academy.

Port Dufferin, Nova Scotia

 
Port Dufferin is a rural community on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia, Canada, in the Halifax Regional Municipality. The community is located on the Marine Drive on Trunk 7 approximately east of Sheet Harbour. The community was formerly known as Salmon River and was renamed in 1899 by an Act of Parliament for Frederick Blackwood, the 1st Marquis of Dufferin and Governor General of Canada from 1872 to 1878. Settlement likely began in the early nineteenth century, and nine families lived in the area by 1827. An Anglican church began construction in the early 1840s, and was consecrated on August 11, 1852. The church was destroyed in the 1890s and a new church was built soon after, which was consecrated in late 1894. A schoolhouse was built in the 1860s. A Presbyterian church opened on March 20, 1904. A two-room school was opened in the 1940s.
Port Dufferin is situated at the mouth of Salmon River, where it empties into Beaver Harbour. The headwaters of the main river are located at Lewiston Lake, northwest of the community at an elevation of about . Upstream from Lewiston Lake, the river segments into the West Branch and East Branch Salmon River. Downstream from the lake, the river progresses toward the southeast until it reaches its mouth at Beaver Harbour in Port Dufferin.

River Doe

The River Doe is a river in North Yorkshire, England. The river's source is near God's Bridge close to the settlement of Chapel-le-Dale and flows through Twisleton in a south-westerly direction to Ingleton, where it meets the River Twiss to form the River Greta. The river forms part of the River Lune system that flows into the Irish Sea.
Course.
The source of the river is found at a place named God's Bridge where Chapel Beck disappears underground and the Doe begins. The river flows southwest, fed by several small unnamed springs on the valley sides. The first named tributary is Light Water Spring which feeds northwest into the river near a disused quarry. Near Twisleton Dale House, the river can be crossed by some stepping stones at a fording point as well as some later near the disused granite quarry. Further downstream near Twisleton Hall, there is another set of stepping stones at a fording point just above Beezley Falls. After flowing under a footbridge, there are another set of falls, Snow Falls, just below the quarry which is operated by Hanson. The river continues past several disused quarries and a footbridge until it reaches the town of Ingleton where it forms a confluence with the River Twiss.
Falls.
Beezley Falls are reached approximately from the source at God's Bridge. These falls consist of a series of cascades, including the "triple spout", running through Baxengyhll Gorge. Rival Falls has a plunge pool known as the "Black Hole". The steepest drops are between and approximately. Snow Falls are situated in the lower gorge about downstream and has similar drops.
Geology.
The main rock of the river valley is turbidite sandstone with some siltstone which are prevalent in the waterfalls and plunge pools. These lay on a bed of Precambrian sedimentary rock which show evidence of its oceanic origins in the ripple and folding marks on exposed surfaces.
Habitat.
The river is home to Brown trout. From Beezley falls to Snow falls, the sides of the gorge are lined with a variety of trees and shrubs.

Kicking a Couple Around

Kicking a Couple Around is an EP by Bill Callahan (also known as Smog). It was released on Drag City in April 1996 and re-released in Europe on Domino in 2001. "Your New Friend" was recorded during a 1995 John Peel radio session. "Back in School," "I Break Horses," and "The Orange Glow of a Stranger's Living Room" were recorded by Steve Albini.
In an interview, Callahan said that "I Break Horses" was written "to help a friend try to understand how a guy she had a one-night stand with could possibly not return her phone calls the next day or ever again."
Critical reception.
"Trouser Press" praised “The Orange Glow of a Stranger’s Living Room,” writing that it "lets some lovely picking and piano pierce the warm gloom of [Smog's] abiding displacement." "The Washington Post" called the EP "four delicate, downbeat songs that have a trad-country mournfulness."

German submarine U-180

German submarine "U-180" was a Type IXD1 transport U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" which served in World War II. Her keel was laid down on 25 February 1941 at the DeSchiMAG AG Weser yard in Bremen as yard number 1020. She was launched on 10 December 1941 and commissioned on 16 May 1942 under "Fregattenkapitän" Werner Musenberg (Crew 25). Stripped of torpedo armament, the Type IXD1s were designated as transport submarines, and could carry up to 252 tonnes of freight. "U-180" was used primarily in clandestine operations.
Design.
German Type IXD1 submarines were considerably larger than the original Type IXs. "U-180" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines plus two MWM RS34.5S six-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines for cruising, producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .
The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . "U-180" was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 24 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 150 rounds, and a SK C/30 with 2575 rounds as well as two C/30 anti-aircraft guns with 8100 rounds. The boat had a complement of fifty-five.
Service history.
First patrol.
"U-180" sailed from Kiel on 8 February 1943, with the leader of the Indian National Army Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and his aide Abid Hasan aboard.
On 18 April "U-180" sank the British 8,132 GRT tanker "Corbis" about east southeast of Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Nine days later, on 27 April, the boat made her rendezvous with the Imperial Japanese Navy , just east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, Bose and Hassan boarded I-29 and two Japanese naval officers, both shipbuilding officers, Captains Emi Tetsushiro and Tomonaga Hideo, who were to study U-boat building techniques upon their arrival in Germany, boarded U-180. Bose and Hasan's transfer is the only known record of a civilian transfer between two submarines of two different navies in World War II. Also received were two tonnes of gold ingots as payment from Japan for weapons technology.
On the return voyage, "U-180" sank the Greek freighter "Boris " west of Ascension Island on 3 June 1943.
During this voyage, "U-180" was supplied by on the way to the exchange. She was supposed to be refueled by on the way back, but that boat was sunk by the British on 16 May 1943. On 19 June, "U-180" was refueled by .
Second patrol and loss.
Under the command of "Oberleutnant zur See" Rolf Riesen (Crew 38), "U-180" sailed from Bordeaux on 20 August 1944 bound for Japan. She was reported sunk off the Bay of Biscay on 23 August 1944, with the loss of all of her 56 crew. The official verdict is "sunk by a mine", however, some experts speculate that trouble with the schnorkel (the underwater breathing and engine operating device), may have been the cause.

Leck Beck

Leck Beck is a watercourse in Lancashire with its source on Crag Hill in Cumbria between Leck Fell and Casterton Fell.
For several kilometres near the start of its course, the water flows into the Ease Gill Cave System, part of The Three Counties System, the longest cave system in Britain (and 26th longest in the world) via 14 major sink holes, to resurge at a major spring at Leck Beck Head.
The rising of Leck Beck Head was dived extensively in the 1980s and required underwater digging and the use of an air chisel to make progress. The overflow for this rising, Witches Cave (Yorkshire), has been dived through a 300m sump into Witches II. A dry entrance was dug into Witches II from the surface in 2010.
The Beck flows through Leck, Cowan Bridge and Overtown before joining the River Lune near Nether Burrow.

Chantal Chamandy

Chantal Chamandy is a Canadian singer and entertainer based in Montreal, Quebec. She previously performed under the names Chantal Condor and Chantal.
Early life.
Chamandy was born in Alexandria, Egypt. Her father was Greek and Egyptian and her mother was Lebanese-Egyptian. The family moved to Montreal, Canada when Chamandy was six years old. She sang in her church choir.
Career.
Her first success was as part of Voggue, a disco duo she formed with Angela Songui. In 1980, the duo released its first self-titled album, which contains the singles "Love Buzz", "Here We Are" and their most successful single, "Dancin' the Night Away". In 1981, a second album was released on Matra Records, containing the singles "I Want To Dance" and "Sunstruck Lovers". Voggue disbanded in 1990.
After Voggue, Chantal recorded as a solo act, which led to an album deal with Epic Records, and she released the album "Chantal Condor" the following year. Off of the album came the singles "Marinero" (backed with "Don't You Want My Love") and "Nightmare". She received a Juno Award nomination in 1990 for Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year.
She dropped use of her last name, releasing "Chantal", on the Columbia Records label in 1989. The single "A Little Lovin'" became a charting single on Canada's RPM 100 Singles chart.
In 1991 she became a member of the French-Canadian dance quartet Collage and appeared on their first and only album, but soon left the group. They then became a trio and the album was re-released without Chantal on the cover.
She did not release new material again until 2006, when she released a series of singles on her own independent label "Ninemuse".
She also used a number of unconventional strategies to get her name and material back into the public eye, including a marketing campaign on public transit and selling her single "Feels Like Love" for $1 a copy in the Dollarama chain of dollar stores, which resulted in the single selling over 10,000 copies and being picked up for sale in conventional record stores. She released "Love Needs You" in 2006 later the same year. "Feels Like Love" received airplay on U.S. Adult Contemporary radio.
On 7 September 2007, she performed a concert in front of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt in conjunction with the Cairo Symphony Orchestra. That performance was released on album and DVD in 2008 as "Beladi", and was also made available for broadcast on PBS in the United States.
Chamandy has done over 15 TV commercials as well as roles in films also credited with an appearance in 2014's "Hit by Lightning", which she produced, and also wrote the score and included some of her songs in the sound track. She was also a producer on "Allen Sunshine", the directorial debut of her son Harley Chamandy, through her firm Mother and Son Films.

Boys in the Sand

Boys in the Sand is a landmark American gay pornographic film, released early in the Golden Age of Porn. The 1971 film was directed by Wakefield Poole and stars Casey Donovan. It was the first gay porn film to include credits and to be reviewed by the film industry journal "Variety", and one of the earliest porn films – after Andy Warhol's 1969 film "Blue Movie," but preceding 1972's "Deep Throat" – to gain mainstream credibility.
Produced on a budget of about $8,000, the film collects three segments depicting Donovan's sexual adventures at a gay beach resort. Promoted by Poole with an advertising campaign unprecedented for a pornographic feature, it premiered in 1971 at the 253-seat 55th Street Playhouse in Manhattan, where it was an immediate critical and commercial success. The film brought Donovan international recognition. A sequel "Boys in the Sand II" was eventually released in 1986, but in the much-changed film and porn markets did not match the success of the original.
The film's title is a parodic reference to the 1968 Mart Crowley play "The Boys in the Band", which had been adapted into a 1970 film of the same name.
Plot.
"Boys in the Sand" is composed of three segments set on Fire Island.
Production.
Wakefield Poole was inspired to make the film after he went with some friends to see a film called "Highway Hustler". After watching the film, he said to a friend, "This is the worst, ugliest movie I've ever seen! Somebody oughta be able to do something better than this." Poole was convinced that he was that somebody; "I wanted [to make] a film that gay people could look at and say, 'I don't mind being gay - it's beautiful to see those people do what they're doing.'" Having enlisted the help of his lover Peter Fisk and another man, Poole first shot a 10-minute segment titled "Bayside".
The success of that initial shoot convinced Poole to plan two more segments and seek theatrical distribution for the completed work. He hired Tommy Moore and Casey Donovan for the third segment, "Inside". When Fisk's scene partner from "Bayside" heard about the potential distribution deal, he refused to sign release forms until he was guaranteed 20% of the profits. Instead, Poole decided to scrap the segment and re-shoot with Fisk and Donovan. The resulting footage was so good that Poole decided to use Donovan for the second segment as well, titled "Poolside", and he constructed the loose storyline around him. The three segments were filmed on a budget of $8,000 over three successive weekends in August 1971 in the gay resort area of Cherry Grove, New York.
Popular and critical reception.
"Boys in the Sand" had its theatrical debut on December 29, 1971, at the 55th Street Playhouse in New York City. Poole engaged in an unprecedented pre-release publicity campaign, including screening parties and full-page ads in "The New York Times" and "Variety".
The line, for the first showing, reached 7th Avenue. The film made back most of its production and promotions budget the day it opened, grossing close to $6,000 in the first hour, and nearly $25,000 during its first week, landing it on "Variety"'s list of the week's 50 top-grossing films. Positive word of mouth spread and the film was favorably reviewed in "Variety" ("There are no more closets!"), "The Advocate" ("Everyone will fall in love with this philandering fellator"), and other outlets, which previously had completely ignored the genre. While some critics were less impressed, others saw the film as akin to the avant-garde work of directors like Kenneth Anger and Andy Warhol. Within six months the film had grossed $140,000 and was continuing to open in theatres across the United States and around the world.
The film's mainstream popularity helped usher in the era of "porno chic," a brief period of mainstream cultural acceptability afforded hardcore pornographic film, having been cited as "very much a precursor" to the following year's crossover success of "Deep Throat". The film attracted critical and scholarly attention from pornography historians and researchers for years after its release. The film is credited with beginning the trend of giving pornographic films titles that spoof the names of non-porn films.
With the success of "Boys in the Sand", Casey Donovan became an underground celebrity. While he never achieved the mainstream film career for which he had hoped, he continued his career in pornography and translated his fame into some appearances on the legitimate stage, including a successful national tour in the gay-themed play "Tubstrip" and an unsuccessful attempt to produce a revival of "The Ritz". His fame also allowed him success as a high-priced prostitute. He remained a bankable commodity in the adult industry, making films for the next 15 years until his death from AIDS-related illness in 1987.
Legacy.
Poole and Donovan had wanted to make a sequel to "Boys in the Sand". In 1984, they shot "Boys in the Sand II". Also filmed on Fire Island, the film featured Donovan, the only cast member from the original to return. The original opening sequence, "Bayside", was recreated for the sequel, with Pat Allen performing the run from the water. Litigation tied up the release of "Boys in the Sand II" until 1986 and with the advent of the home video market, there was a glut of gay porn titles available. "Boys in the Sand II" did not distinguish itself from the competition and was not particularly successful.
In 2002, TLA Releasing released "The Wakefield Poole Collection". The two-DVD set includes "Boys in the Sand" and "Boys in the Sand II" along with "Bijou" (1972), a third Poole/Donovan collaboration, and other shorts and material shot by Poole. The collection won a 2003 GayVN Award for Best Classic Gay DVD.
In May 2014, filmmaker and writer Jim Tushinski's full-length documentary "I Always Said Yes: The Many Lives of Wakefield Poole", which features extensive interviews with Poole, producer Marvin Schulman, and many contemporaries, began playing at film festivals. In June 2014, the DVD company Vinegar Syndrome restored "Boys in the Sand" from the remaining film elements and released this new version on DVD along with early short films by Wakefield Poole and several documentary shorts about the filming and reception of "Boys in the Sand".

Prix de Malleret

The Prix de Malleret is a Group 2 flat horse race in France open to three-year-old thoroughbred fillies. It is run at Saint-Cloud over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1½ miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late June.
History.
The event is named after Malleret, the location of a former stud farm in the Médoc region of France. The original version was a 1,600-metre race for three-year-olds of either gender.
A new version restricted to fillies was established in 1907. It was initially contested over 2,000 metres at Longchamp. It served as a consolation for fillies defeated in the Prix de Diane. It was abandoned throughout World War I, with no running from 1915 to 1918.
The Prix de Malleret was cancelled once during World War II, in 1940. It was staged at Maisons-Laffitte in 1943 and 1944.
The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for a period the Prix de Malleret held Group 3 status. It was promoted to Group 2 level in 1977.
The Prix de Malleret was extended to 2,400 metres in 1987. It was transferred to Saint-Cloud in 2001. It is currently run on the same day as the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud.

Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959

The Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act, 1959 (Act No. 46 of 1959, commenced 19 June; subsequently renamed the Promotion of Black Self-government Act, 1959 and later the Representation between the Republic of South Africa and Self-governing Territories Act, 1959) was an important piece of South African apartheid legislation that allowed for the transformation of traditional tribal lands into "fully fledged independent states Bantustans", which would supposedly provide for the right to self-determination of the country's black population. It also resulted in the abolition of parliamentary representation for black South Africans, an act furthered in 1970 with the passage of the Black Homeland Citizenship Act.
Background.
The Act was designed to further the policy of so-called "Grand Apartheid", meaning the permanent partition of South Africa into national "homelands" for each supposed "people" or nation. In this plan, the "Afrikaners" (indigenized Dutch) people would control the bulk of the country, while the African population was divided into eight peoples, defined according to language groups, that would have separate nation-states in areas unilaterally demarcated by the white regime. Each black "nation" was then provided with a Commissioner-General, who was entrusted with the development of its assigned Homeland into a fully self-governing state. Blacks were expected to exercise their political rights in these Homeland enclave states, not in the remainder of South Africa where white supremacy would continue and Afrikaner nationalism would be expressed.
Content of the Act.
The following is a brief description of the sections of the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act, 1959:

The Just Judges

The Just Judges, also called The Righteous Judges, is the lower left panel of the "Ghent Altarpiece", painted by Jan van Eyck or his brother Hubert Van Eyck between 1430 and 1432. It is believed that the panel shows portraits of several contemporary figures such as Philip the Good, and possibly the artists Hubert and Jan van Eyck themselves. The panel was stolen in 1934 and has never been found.
Theft.
The panel was displayed at the Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium, together with the rest of the "Ghent Altarpiece", until it was stolen during the night of 10 April 1934, possibly by the Belgian Arsène Goedertier (Lede, 23 December 1876 – Dendermonde, 25 November 1934). The day after the theft, the commissioner of the Ghent police, Antoine Luysterborghs, was briefly present at the crime scene before leaving to investigate a theft at a nearby cheese shop.
The panel was removed from the frame, apparently with care, leaving the other panels undamaged. In the empty space was left a note, written in French, with the words, "Taken from Germany by the Treaty of Versailles", a reference to the fact that the altarpiece, having been removed to Berlin by German forces during World War I, had to be returned in accordance with of the Treaty of Versailles. On 30 April, the Bishop of Ghent received a ransom demand for one million Belgian francs, to which the Belgian minister refused to agree. A second letter was delivered in May. The Belgian government then commenced negotiations with the thief arguing that since the lost panel was a national treasure, the diocese's ownership interest was subordinate to that of the nation. Correspondence continued through October between the thief and the government, with the exchange of at least 11 letters. In an act of good faith, the ransomer returned one of the panel's two parts (a grisaille painting of St John the Baptist).
On 25 November 1934 the self-proclaimed thief, Arsène Goedertier, revealed on his deathbed to his lawyer that he was the only one who knew where the masterpiece was hidden, and that he would take the secret to his grave. Goedertier told his lawyer, Georges de Vos, that "I alone know where the Mystic Lamb is. The information is in the drawer on the right of my writing table, in an envelope marked 'mutualité. De Vos found carbon copies of the ransom notes, and an unsent note that said "[it] rests in a place where neither I, nor anybody else, can take it away without arousing the attention of the public." De Vos only told the police of Goedertier's confession a month later. The police concluded that Goedertier had been the thief.
There is speculation that the presumed thief, Goedertier, could not have acted alone and that he must have had inside help possibly from one of the four custodians of the cathedral. Several people have claimed to know its whereabouts and extensive searches have been held to locate it including an X-ray of the whole cathedral to a depth of . The panel has never been recovered and is now believed to have been destroyed. To this day, a Ghent police detective remains assigned to the case of the missing panel.
Replacement copy.
The panel was replaced in 1945 by a copy made by Belgian restorer and copyist Jef Van der Veken. Van der Veken used a two-centuries old closet shelf for the panel. His reference was another copy Michiel Coxie had produced in the mid-16th century for Philip II of Spain, and kept at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium. In order to harmonize his copy with the appearance of other panels of the Ghent Altarpiece, Van der Veken applied a layer of wax to create a similar patina. He subtly indicated his work was a copy by giving one of the horsemen the facial features of Leopold III, who was the reigning King of the Belgians at the time the panel was stolen and the copy made.
The painting in popular culture.
The panel plays a prominent symbolic role in the novel "The Fall" (1956) by Albert Camus. Its protagonist, Jean-Baptiste Clamence, claims to have found the painting in a bar called "Mexico City", and his secret withholding of the painting empowers him, he feels, in his newfound role of "judge-penitent".
The panel can be seen in the television series "Arrow" (season 3, episode 16), in Ra's al Ghul's lair at the dinner table.
The panel is the centerpiece of the novel "The Omega Factor" by Steve Berry, published July 2022.

Ordinary People (Guest novel)

Ordinary People is Judith Guest's first novel. Published in 1976, it tells the story of a year in the life of the Jarretts, an affluent suburban family trying to cope with the aftermath of two traumatic events.
Although it won critical praise and awards upon its release, it is best remembered today as the basis for the 1980 film version, which won four Academy Awards including Best Picture. The novel received the 1976 Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize and is also assigned in many American secondary school English classes.
Synopsis.
The novel begins as life is seemingly returning to normal for the Jarretts of Lake Forest, Illinois, in September 1975. It is slightly more than a year since their elder son Buck was killed when a sudden storm came up while he and their other son Conrad were sailing on Lake Michigan. Six months later, a severely depressed Conrad attempted suicide by slashing his wrists with a razor in the bathroom. His parents committed him to a psychiatric hospital from which he has only recently returned after eight months of treatment. He is attending school and trying to resume his life, but knows he still has unresolved issues, particularly with his mother, Beth, who has never really recovered from Buck's death and keeps an almost maniacally perfect household and family.
His father Calvin, a successful tax attorney, gently leans on him to make appointments to see a local psychiatrist, Dr. Tyrone C. Berger. Initially resistant, he slowly starts to respond to Dr. Berger and comes to terms with the root cause of his depression, his identity crisis and survivor's guilt over having survived when Buck did not. Also helping is a relationship with a new girlfriend, Jeannine Pratt.
Calvin sees Dr. Berger as the events of the recent past have caused him to begin to doubt many things he once took for granted, leading to a midlife crisis. This leads to strain in his marriage as he finds Beth increasingly cold and distant, while she in turn believes he is overly concerned about Conrad to the point of being manipulated. Finally the friction becomes enough that Beth decides to leave him at the novel's conclusion. Father and son, however, have closed the gap between them.
Characters.
Three other characters do not appear in the story directly but have a strong effect on it nonetheless, recalled extensively by Conrad and Calvin:
Major themes.
Loss and the different ways people deal with it are a major theme of "Ordinary People". Conrad loses not only his brother but a good portion of his then-self when Buck dies. His father finds himself re-examining his life and seeing it more the result of random chance and accident than any ability on his part. Beth tries to control it like everything else in her life. She and Conrad were, Calvin notes, the only people not to cry at Buck's funeral.
Technique.
Guest's chapters alternate between Conrad and Calvin, in third person limited omniscient narration entirely in the present tense. Readers are privy to their thoughts but not those of the other characters in the scene, not even Cal or Conrad if they happen to intrude. The narrative frequently goes into patches of italicized interior monologue and stream of consciousness.
The novel also circles around both the accident that killed Buck and Conrad's suicide attempt. In the initial chapters they are both only referenced or discussed in the most general terms; later on we learn more details and finally get brief flashbacks from Conrad.
History.
Origin.
Guest began "Ordinary People" as a short story, but found herself writing more and more as she explored the characters in greater depth, wanting to know more about their backgrounds. "Before I knew it," she says "I was 200 pages in". It took her three years to write, after she gave up her teaching job and decided to concentrate on actually finishing a novel.
It became focused on the psychology of the characters, particularly Conrad.
I wanted to explore the anatomy of depression—how it works and why it happens to people; how you can go from being down but able to handle it, to being so down that you don’t even want to handle it, and then taking a radical step with your life—trying to commit suicide—and failing at that, coming back to the world and having to "act normal" when, in fact, you have been forever changed.
Publication.
Guest did not have an agent initially. The first publisher she sent it to, Ballantine Books, rejected it. The second sent a rejection letter that read in part: "While the book has some satiric bite, overall the level of writing does not sustain interest and we will have to decline it." An editor at Viking Press bought the manuscript, but the company waited eight months before putting it out, the first time in 26 years it had published an unsolicited manuscript.
In 1976, it won the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for best first novel. 90,000 copies were sold in hardback; Robert Redford, who eventually directed the film, acquired the rights before publication (actually traveling to Guest's suburban Minnesota home to do so). Since 1976, half a million copies of the paperback have been sold.
Legacy.
In the wake of the film version, the novel has been assigned in many American high school (and sometimes middle school) English classes due to its young-adult protagonist. This has led to some challenges to its inclusion on reading lists and curricula due to not only the subject matter but a short scene near the end of the novel in which Conrad and Jeannine make love. The American Library Association ranked it 59th on its list of the 100 most frequently challenged books in school libraries during the 1990s.
Film, TV, and theatrical adaptations.
Robert Redford bought the rights to Guest's manuscript before it was published, intending not to act in it but make his directorial debut with the film. "Ordinary People" was released in 1980, winning that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Redford and Timothy Hutton also received Oscars for directing and acting, respectively. It also won the Best Adapted Screenplay award, written by Alvin Sargent.
A play of the same name was published in 1983, in an adaptation by Nancy Pahl-Gilsenan.

Get It On Tonite

"Get It On Tonite" is the lead single released from American singer turned pastor Montell Jordan's fourth album, "Get It On...Tonite" (1999). The song was produced by Brian "Lilz" Palmer and Sergio "PLX" Moore, who used a sample of Claudja Barry's 1976 single "Love for the Sake of Love".
"Get It On Tonite" reached number four on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming his last solo single to chart on the Hot 100. It also spent three consecutive weeks at number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart and sold 800,000 copies domestically. A remix entitled "Get It On with LL and Montell", which features labelmate LL Cool J, was included on several formats of the single.
Samplings.
In July 2012, "Get It On Tonite" was sampled on Harlem rapper Azealia Banks's first mixtape, "Fantasea", on the penultimate track "Esta Noche". "Pitchfork Media"'s Marc Hogan praised the track, saying that "the best and penultimate cut on "Fantasea", "Esta Noche", points in a promising new direction: conversational, cheater-luring pickup lines over a warmly inviting sample from Montell Jordan's 1999 R&amp;B hit "Get It on Tonite". Critics praised producer Munchi's fusion of electronic dance music and R&amp;B, with the track being named as a highlight of the tape.

Frritt-Flacc

"Frritt-Flacc" is a horror short story by Jules Verne. It was first published in December 1884 in the magazine "Le Figaro illustré" and then in 1886 together with the novel "The Lottery Ticket" as a part of the "Voyages Extraordinaires" series. The first English translation was published in 1892 in "The Strand Magazine".
Setting.
The story is set in the fictional port town of Luktrop, consisting of about "a hundred houses" and "four or five hilly streets". The town is located at the Volsinian coast, between the mountains of Crimma and the "vast Sea of Megalocrida". Near the town is Vauglor, an active volcano. "During the day it sends forth sulphurous vapours; at night, from time to time, great outpourings of flame." The flames of the volcano serve as the town's lighthouse, allowing travelers to locate the port. 
The town is surrounded by ruins, supposedly "dating from the Crimmarian era". It has its own suburb, with white walls, domed roofs, and sun-scorched terraces. The suburb is built in the style of a Kasbah, and the unnamed narrator describes its appearance as similar to Arab architecture. 
The tallest building in Luktrop is a square belfry, dedicated to Saint Philfilena. The town and the belfry are at times affected by hurricanes, and the hurricanes set in motion the bells. The locals considered these unscheduled ringings of the bells to be a bad omen.
The vicinity of Luktrop has "scattered habitations", which the narrator describes as similar to those in Brittany. The narrator explains that Luktrop is not located in Brittany, but claims to not know whether it is located in France or in Europe.
Plot summary.
"Frritt" expresses the sounds of a roaring hurricane and "flacc" the sound of falling streams of water during a rainstorm.
Dr. Trifulgas, a physician, lives in Luktrop, at a building known as the "Six-four", due to having six openings on one side and four on the other. The "Six-four" is described as one of the richest and most comfortable houses in Luktrop. Due to his medical career, Trifulgas owns a fortune consisting of "millions of " (the local currency). He reportedly lacks compassion and insists on receiving advance payments before treating any patient. He lives alone with his pet dog Hurzof, a mongrel. 
On a stormy night, Trifulgas is visited at home by a young girl, who asks him to tend to her dying father. Trifulgas enquires on the name of the father. When he learns that the father is Vort Kartif, a man who trades in salted herring at a location called Val Karnion, he refuses to help the girl. Trifulgas knows Kartif, and knows that he is a poor man. He does not expect to receive sufficient payment from him, so chooses not to bother and goes back to sleep. 
Twenty minutes later, Trifulgas is visited by a woman claiming to be Vort Kartif's wife. She wants him to travel to Val Karnion with her and tend to her dying husband, and offers a payment of twenty . Trifulgas rejects her offer, as he finds the offered payment insufficient. He does not wish to travel in a storm and risk catching a cold or to suffer from lumbago. He also expects to soon visit Edzingov, a rich patient suffering from gout, and he charges the man fifty for every visit. Trifulgas goes back to sleep. 
Later than night, Trifulgas is visited by a woman claiming to be Vort Kartif's mother. He is annoyed and wishes for Kartif's daughter, wife, and mother to perish with him. The woman claims to have money, from the recent sale of their house to "camondeur Doutrup". Trifulgas asks for a payment of two-hundred , but the woman only has a hundred and twenty . Trifulgas initially turns down the offer, but changes his mind after figuring that "a small profit" is better than nothing. 
Trifulgas receives his payment in advance, and follows the old woman by foot. His trained dog carries a lantern to light their way. Trifulgas can hear the bells ringing, but ignores the bad omen. He does not believe in superstitions. Shortly before they reach Kartif's house, the volcano explodes and Trifulgas is hurled to the ground. When he rises from the ground, the lantern has been extinguished and the old woman has disappeared. Trifulgas walks alone towards Kartif's house. Having already received his payment, he is determined to fulfil his part of the bargain. 
When Trifulgas reaches Kartif's house, he realizes that it resembles the "Six-four" in many ways. He strangely feels as if entering his own house. He enters the house alone, through an unlocked door. Hurzof, his dog, stays outside the house and starts howling. Inside the house, Trifulgas recognizes the rooms, furniture, and books from the "Six-four". He even finds a book open at page 197, the same book he left open at that page earlier in the story. Trifulgas suddenly feels fear. He approaches the bed, and finds himself lying there. His patient is not Vort Kartif, but Trifulgas himself.
Trifulgas quickly recognizes symptoms in the patient: heart failure, cerebral apoplexy, paralysis of the body. Soon there is organ failure, both the heart and the lungs cease to function. Desperate for a cure for his patient-self, Trifulgas decides to try bloodletting. But no blood flows from the open veins. As the doctor tends to the patient, he starts demonstrating signs of poor health. First the patient dies, then the doctor. Both versions of Trifulgas are dead, as he has failed to heal himself. 
The following morning, Trifulgas' copse is discovered in the "Six-four". The locals arrange his funeral at the cemetery of Luktrop, where he is buried alongside former patients whose lives he had failed to save. Hurzof the dog has disappeared, but the folklore of Luktrop and Volsinia speaks of the dog haunting the country, a long time after the death of its master. Hurzof is still transporting Trifulgas' lantern, and reportedly keeps howling like a lost dog.

Pierre-Flavien Turgeon

Pierre-Flavien Turgeon (November 13, 1787, in Quebec City, Quebec – August 25, 1867, in Quebec City) was a Canadian Roman Catholic priest and Archbishop of Quebec for 17 years.
Life.
Pierre-Flavien Turgeon was born in Québec on November 13, 1787. He entered the Séminaire de Québec in 1799. His father, a merchant, died the following year, and his half-brother Louis served as guardian. In 1806, Joseph-Octave Plessis, Bishop of Quebec, appointed Turgeon his secretary. He was ordained in 1810.
Turgeon continued to assist Bishop Plessis in the administration of the diocese, while also fulfilling a number of different duties at the seminary. He taught philosophy from 1812 to 1815, when he became director of the Grand Seminaire. All the while, Plessis was grooming him for the episcopacy. The strain of managing both academic and diocesan responsibilities undermined his health, and in 1819, as a respite, he accompanied Plessis to Europe. Upon his return, he withdrew from teaching, but became director of the Petit Seminaire.
Plessis was succeeded by Bernard-Claude Panet in 1825, who was followed by Joseph Signay in 1833. In February 1834, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Turgeon titular bishop of Sidyme and coadjutor of Archbishop Signay. Despite fragile health, Turgeon was an excellent administrator and active coadjutor.
As auxiliary bishop, he concentrated on the areas of education and religious congregations. Of a mild disposition, he was often able to mediate disagreements between Archbishop Signay and Ignace Bourget, Bishop of Montreal. In 1844, Turgeon made a pastoral visit among the missions of the Saint Lawrence Gulf.
In November 1849, due to ill health, Signay turned over administration of the diocese to his coadjutor. Signay died in October 1850, and Turgeon succeeded as Archbishop of Quebec.
Notably collegial in his approach, Turgeon called the first provincial council of Quebec in 1851. In 1852, the suffragan dioceses of Trois-Rivières and Saint-Hyacinthe were erected. He was a moving force behind the founding of the Université Laval. Following a serious illness, in February 1855 he handed over administration of the diocese to his coadjutor, Bishop Charles-François Baillargeon. Turgeon was stricken with paralysis and often unable to speak the last seven years of his life. He died on August 25, 1867, and was buried in the cathedral.

Mount Ellis Academy

Mount Ellis Academy is a co-educational private high school (grades 9 through 12) located about east of Bozeman, Montana, United States.
Founded in 1902, Mt. Ellis Academy includes boys and girls dormitories, an Administration building, gymnasium, and other facilities. Mt. Ellis operates a ski area on US Forest Service land about from the school in Bear Canyon. The academy sits on a campus.
During peak years in the 1960s, Mt. Ellis had nearly 200 students. In recent decades enrollment has trended downward and stood at about 70 students for the 2005- 2006 school year. According to a 2001 report, out of over 100 private schools in Montana, Mount Ellis was one of only ten accredited under state education standards.
Mt Ellis Academy is sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and is part of the Montana Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.
It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.
Kohl's Cares Win.
In 2010, Kohl's started a Facebook contest for schools in the US to win $500,000. Mt. Ellis Academy entered this contest and came out in 10th place with 144,006 votes. After the authentication of votes process, they were in 9th place. Part of the campaign for votes was the saying, "Vote for our Sewers!" coming from the fact they planned to use the $500,000 to upgrade their 1950s era sewer system. At the Academy and in the Church, this is spoken of as a miracle.

Local medical committee

A local medical committee is a statutory body in the UK. LMCs are recognised by successive NHS Acts as the professional organisation representing individual GPs and GP practices as a whole to the primary care organisation. The NHS Act 1999 extended the LMC role to include representation of all GPs whatever their contractual status. This includes sessional GP and GP speciality registrars. The LMC represents the views of GPs to any other appropriate organisation or agency.
In the United Kingdom, local medical committees (LMCs) have been the local general practitioner (GP) committees since 1911. They represent all general practitioners in their geographical area which is historically coterminous with the successive Primary Care Organisations or other healthcare administrative areas.
As the organisation and complexity of primary care has increased and along with the call for increased professionalism and specialisation of for instance negotiators, LMCs' administrative structures have developed from a pile of papers on the kitchen table of the LMC medical secretary to permanent staff and offices with substantial assets. This has allowed the LMCs to develop relationships ranging over time, topic and space between mutual suspicion and antagonism to useful cooperation for common benefit with NHS administrative organisations.
The LMCs interact and work with and through the British Medical Association's General Practitioners Committee (GPC) and with other craft committees and local specialist medical committees in various ways, including conferences. The Northumberland Local Medical Committee has been involved in "creating a general practice data set in England."
They are funded by a statutory levy, of so many pence per patient on GP principals and practices, and generally receive contributions from non-principal GPs on various local bases.
They have recently rejected the opt-out model for care records in Great Britain, were involved in a nurse controversy, and became "divided over what the GPC's action should be on pay freeze in Great Britain."

Acephalous society

In anthropology, an acephalous society (from the Greek ἀκέφαλος "headless") is a society which lacks political leaders or hierarchies. Such groups are also known as non-stratified societies. Typically these societies are small-scale, organized into bands or tribes that make decisions through consensus decision making rather than appointing permanent chiefs or kings. 
When societies do not possess distinctions of rank, they are described as egalitarian. 
In scientific literature covering native African societies and the effect of European colonialism on them the term is often used to describe groups of people living in a settlement with "no government in the sense of a group able to exercise effective control over both the people and their territory". In this respect the term is also often used as synonymous to "stateless society". Such societies are described as consensus-democratic in opposition to the majority-democratic systems of the West.
The Tiv and Igbo of Nigeria, the Nuer of Sudan, the Somalis, and the Bedouin Arabs throughout North Africa are allegedly acephalous or egalitarian societies.

Trance Energy

Trance Energy was a Dutch trance event featuring trance music DJs from around the world. It was organized by ID&amp;T and was held since 1999 in various venues in the Netherlands. In 2011, ID&amp;T changed the concept and renamed the festival to "Energy", opening the festival to other genres from Trance only. 
History.
The event was founded in 1999. Traditionally, there was a "small" edition and a big edition each year. In 2002, the small edition failed to sell out its 20,000-person ticket capacity (only 15,000 tickets were sold) and thereafter, Trance Energy was only held once annually, at the Jaarbeurs convention center in Utrecht, where it has been sold out each year up to 2009. The festival gained "cult" status among trance fans. In 2010, it failed to sell out by slight margins since it was organized on Easter week end and this was problematic for some foreign visitors (especially from Poland).
While audience in the first years was mostly Dutch, there were subsequently many international visitors, mainly from the European Union but sometimes from other areas around the world. This is due to the festival earning worldwide fame thanks to bootlegs of DJ mixes and some official videos of former editions. At the 2010 edition, it has been quoted by ID&amp;T that more than 40% of the audience was not Dutch.
In 2011, ID&amp;T changed the concept and renamed the festival to "Energy", opening the festival to other genres from Trance only. The change was announced in September 2010, and labelled as a simple "name change". However, it wasn't just that and non-trance artists were included in the line-up. This change caused controversy and was very negatively greeted on internet forums. Meanwhile, one ID&amp;T competitor launched a Trance only festival in the Netherlands. As a result, attendance declined steadily with edition 2011 and 2012 being not sold out by large margins (only half of 2012 tickets were sold). In 2013, the event was moved to the Ziggo Dome, a smaller venue in Amsterdam and still it failed to sell out. There was no announcement of a 2014 edition.
In 2017, Trance Energy "returned" as a stage at Tomorrowland, also organized by ID&amp;T. In 2018, Trance Energy was a stage at Tomorrowland and Mysteryland too. Since then, Trance Energy has remained at Mysteryland.
Description of the Event.
Past 2003 editions of Trance Energy usually focus on three stages located in different halls of the Jaarbeurs convention center and connected by corridors :
Since 2007, a fourth stage has been added, the "Hard Stage" featuring harder derivatives of Trance Music.
In 2009, students of the Utrecht School for the Arts were asked to design the entrance of the festival. They created a multi-disciplinary entrance, where interactivity, game-elements, video, fashion and music came together.
Trance Energy toured Australia in 2009. The tour attracted controversy after police shut down the Melbourne leg early due to 26 overdoses.
History of editions.

Diomed

Diomed (1777–1808) was an English Thoroughbred race horse who won the inaugural running of the Epsom Derby in 1780. Sold and imported to Virginia, he was subsequently a successful sire in the United States after the American Revolutionary War.
Racing years.
A bright chestnut standing , he was named after the Ancient Greek hero Diomedes. By the unraced Florizel out of the unraced Pastorella's Dam, also known as "Sister to Juno" (both going back to the Godolphin Arabian, and Sister to Juno going back as well to the Darley Arabian), Diomed was bred by the Hon. Richard Vernon and owned by Sir Charles Bunbury, 6th Baronet, then trained by him at Hilton Hall. He was started 19 times, winning 11 races, finishing second in 4, and third in 3.
Of these 11 wins, ten were consecutive, which included the inaugural running of the Epsom Derby in 1780. During these early bright years of Diomed's life, he was considered by many to be the best colt seen in the Britain since Eclipse in 1769 and 1770.
He was allowed to rest for a while, but when he was brought back to the races, he had mixed results. Sometimes he would win, and sometimes he wouldn't win, more often the latter than the former. His last win was a King's Plate in 4-mile heats, carrying 168 pounds.
Stud career in England.
Sir Charles retired Diomed to stud in 1784. Due to Diomed's tarnished reputation, his fee was only about five guineas, or about $25. 
In England, Diomed sired Grey Diomed (b. 1785), a gray stallion out of the mare Grey Dorimant, by Dorimant (b. 1772) either of the Darley Arabian sire line or the St. Victor Barb sire line. Grey Diomed was exported to Russia, where he was a great success, and more Diomed offspring were exported to Russia, where some were likely used as foundation stock for the Orlov Trotter.
Diomed also sired the mare Young Giantess (b. 1790), who foaled Sorcerer and Eleanor, also owned by Sir Charles. Young Giantess also produced two sisters to Eleanor, Julia and Cressida, who produced the Epsom Derby winners Priam and Phantom, as well as the 2000 Guineas winner Antar. 
Diomed also sired the notable broodmares Young Noisette (b. 1789), who produced the stallion Marmion (b. 1806), and Fanny (b. 1790).
Over the next decade or so, interest in Diomed as a sire declined, as several of his sons became known for having temperament problems, stubbornness, and too much excitability. Diomed's fertility as a sire also began to decline as he aged. Diomed's fee went down and down until, by the age of 21, it was two guineas. By then, there were virtually no takers, so the old stallion did nothing but graze alone.
In the United States.
Sir Charles offered Diomed for sale when the stallion was 21 years old. Colonel John Hoomes of Bowling Green, Virginia bought him for $250, and then shipped him to Virginia, where he was returned to stud in 1798. Aside from importing bloodstock into the United States, Hoomes also maintained his own racing stable and stud service in which his good friend, the leading national horseman of the time, John Tayloe III, was a partner. Although Hoomes and Tayloe's English agent wrote Hoomes a letter stating very clearly that Diomed was "...a tried and true bad foal-getter", and strongly recommending he not be put to stud, they were unswayed. Besides being personally impressed with the horse, a stallion of Tayloe's had also recently hurt himself, and Tayloe was in immediate need of a stud to replace him. Diomed went to work.
In those days, stallions did not stand in one place, but moved from stud farm to stud farm, doing live covers of mares. Diomed lived like this until he was 31 years old, and was active to his final days in 1808. His fee increased with his fame and his fame increased so quickly that Hoomes was able to sell a share in him for six times his purchase price soon after he landed on American soil.
Diomed - along with the gray stallion Medley (b. 1776), the brown stallion Shark (b. 1771), and the gray stallion Messenger (b. 1780) - was one of the four most important stallions introduced into early American Thoroughbred foundation stock. Diomed was also subsequently bred to several daughters of Medley and Shark. Diomed's offspring competed with many of the greatest horses in American turf history: Haynie's Maria (b. 1808), about whom Andrew Jackson said, "...Haynie's Maria can beat anything in God's whole creation"; Ball's Florizel (b. 1801); Potomac (b. 1803); Duroc (b. 1806), the sire of American Eclipse; and his most influential son of all, Sir Archy (b. 1805). 
Sir Archy had a huge influence on Thoroughbred history in the United States, siring the line which led to Timoleon, Boston, and Lexington. His descendants include Black Caviar, Phar Lap, Secretariat and American Pharoah. Other famous descendants of Diomed included Traveller, the war mount of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, as well as Cincinnati, the war mount of Union general Ulysses S. Grant. Diomed and Sir Archy also had strong influence on many U.S. Cavalry war mounts in the American Civil War.
Furthermore, Diomed's influence has been felt through his sons regarding the development of the breeds American Quarter Horse (Sir Archy) and Standardbred (Duroc).
At Diomed's death at the age of 31 in 1808, it was reported, "...there was as much mourning over his demise as there was at the death of George Washington."
Pedigree.
 Diomed is inbred 4S x 4D to the stallion Partner, meaning that he appears fourth generation on the sire side of his pedigree and fourth generation on the dam side of his pedigree.
 Diomed is inbred 4S x 4D to the stallion Godolphin Arabian, meaning that he appears fourth generation on the sire side of his pedigree and fourth generation on the dam side of his pedigree.

Czech Republic at the 1994 Winter Olympics

The Czech Republic competed at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.
It was the first Winter Games since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, and so the Czech Republic and Slovakia competed as independent teams.
Cross-country skier Pavel Benc was the flag-bearer of the country in the opening ceremony – he thus had a chance to lead the last Winter Olympic Czechoslovak team in Albertville and the first ever Czech team in Lillehammer.
Although the three medals won by Czechoslovakia in Albertville in 1992 were all won by Czech athletes (the ice hockey team had also three Slovaks), the result of Lillehammer Olympics were less satisfying as fifth places of ice hockey and Nordic combined teams were the Czech Republic's best results. It can be explained with the growth of competition as the former Soviet Union countries entered their athletes (only Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia participated in the 1992 Winter Olympics besides the Unified Team).
Competitors.
The following is the list of number of competitors in the Games.
Bobsleigh.
Jiří Džmura and Pavel Polomský became most successful Czech bobsledders in Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track. They finished fifth in the first run of two-men bobsleigh competition, falling slowly in the results to eventually finish in seventh tied with Canada's Pierre Lueders. In the four-men competition, the Czech team went through the competition in the opposite manner – starting 14th and moving up step by step to the 10th-place finish with a fifth best fourth run.
Cross-country skiing.
Kateřina Neumannová presented a huge leap in form since last Olympics, finishing only 13 seconds behind podium in 5 km classical and moving up to sixth place in the pursuit. She recorded the second best time on her third leg of women's relay (losing only to Russia's Nina Gavrilyuk) and had the leading role in the ninth-place finish of the Czech relay team as other women had 11th to 13th times in their respective legs.
Men participated with almost the same squad like in Albertville, but their performances were far worse than in French Alps.
Figure skating.
Radka Kovaříková and René Novotný were fourth in the 1992 Winter Olympics and in 1994 they recorded their fourth consecutive fourth place in the European Championships. Two great pairs-champions however returned this season and were great favorites, which was confirmed as 1988 Olympic champions Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov beat 1992 Olympic champions Nataliya Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev. The Czech couple was not able to fight for a medal in such competition. It finished fifth in the short program, but fell down to sixth in a free program behind United States' Jenni Meno and Todd Sand. The next year Kovaříková and Novotný however won the Figure Skating World Championships and turned professionals.
Kateřina Mrázová and Martin Šimeček recorded their best Olympic finish in ice dancing competition in eighth place in a competition crowned by Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean comeback to the Olympics, 10 years after their revolutionary Bolero.
Ice hockey.
Czech Republic arrived to Lillehammer as the unbeaten winner of the recent Globen Cup, the Swedish part of the European Hockey Tour. The Olympic tournament however had a rather different result. Finland, at the start of the tournament not supposed to be a favorite, was in the lead since the fifth minute power play goal, following three games added the compulsory victories but only win over Germany coached by Luděk Bukač was supported by a good play. The team was not able to beat any of the strong European team and lost to Russia 3-4 to leave it in fourth place in group but to finish only third behind Finland, which hammered Russia, and Germany.
The standings in the other group set a tie against Canada in the quarterfinals. The Czechs lead twice in the game and Canada scores the tying goal five minutes to the end of regulation. In the overtime, Paul Kariya scored the sudden-death power-play goal (Horák served the penalty). The Czechs had to settle with the 5-8th places classification games and avoided surprise beating United States 5-3 after losing to them 0-2 early in the first period. The 5th to 6th place game was the first confrontation of former compatriots, but Slovakia was overmotivated and outplayed 7-1 (the game was decided in the first period, despite losing 0-1 in third minute, the Czechs won it 5-1).
Canada eliminated Czech Republic also in the 1994 World Championships; the two 5th-place finishes forced Ivan Hlinka to withdraw. His successor Luděk Bukač then leads Czech Republic to the 1996 World Championships title, first since 1985 and first of four titles in six years.
Nordic combined.
The team competition brought a surprising result for the Czech Republic which eventually occurred to be one of the biggest successes of the whole Olympic team. Zbyněk Pánek, Milan Kučera and František Máka all had one good and one worse jump in the ski-jumping competition (Pánek and Kučera were better in the first round, Máka, who was better cross-country skier, bettered his result in the second round). The Czechs started the cross-country relay in sixth place, 10:50 minutes behind sovereign Japanese jumpers.
The relay was not a dramatic one, as no change happened from first to fourth place, Zbyněk Pánek moved the Czechs past Austria to fifth place already in the first leg. Milan Kučera held the place despite his worst cross-country performance and František Máka brought the relay home in fifth ahead of fast-finishing France.
Ski jumping.
Two-time team Olympic medalist Jiří Parma was below par in Lillehammer and thus only Jaroslav Sakala managed to record a good individual result in Lillehammer, finishing seventh in large hill competition, but he did not improve in the next two competitions. In the team competition Parma was the weakest member of the team as Zbyněk Krompolc surprisingly recorded best results of the whole team.

Arthur F. Griffith

Arthur Frederick Griffith (30 July 1880 – 25 December 1911) was a calculating prodigy born July 30, 1880, in Milford, Kosciusko County, Indiana. He could count to 40,000 by age five. An illness at age seven resulted in epilepsy and prevented him from attending school until age 10. At age 12, he began to develop calculating short cuts. He dropped out of school at age 17, but continued to study numbers and practice mental calculation on his own.
At age 19, he met Dr. Ernest Hiram Lindley, who invited Arthur to Indiana University to be studied in the psychology laboratory which had been established in 1892 by Dr. William Lowe Bryan. Bryan and Lindley took Arthur to the American Psychological Association meeting at Yale in December 1899, where he exhibited his skills and the I.U. professors presented a paper about their research of Arthur's case. William Lowe Bryan, in 1900, presented a similar paper at the meeting of the International Congress of Psychology in Paris.
Arthur Griffith left Indiana University after five months, wrote a book of his methods, entitled "The Easy and Speedy Reckoner", and toured the vaudeville circuit until his death, allegedly of a stroke, in a Springfield, Massachusetts hotel room at age 31 on Christmas Day, 1911.

Charles Michel de Langlade

Charles Michel Mouet de Langlade (9 May 1729 – after 26 July 1801) was a Great Lakes fur trader and war chief who was important in protecting French territory in North America. His mother was Ottawa and his father a French Canadian fur trader.
Fluent in Ottawa and French, Langlade later led First Nations forces in warfare in the region. Given the shifting political realities of the time, he and his followers were at various times allied with the French, British and, lastly, Americans. Leading French and Indian forces, in 1752 he destroyed Pickawillany, a Miami village and British trading post in present-day Ohio, where the British and French were competing for control of the lucrative fur trade. During the subsequent Seven Years' War, he helped defend Fort Duquesne (Pittsburgh) against the British. The French appointed Langlade as second in command at Fort Michilimackinac and a captain in the Indian Department of French Canada.
After the defeat of the French in North America, Langlade became allied with the British, who took control of former French possessions and took the lead in the fur trade in the upper West. During the American Revolutionary War, Langlade led Great Lakes Indians for the British against rebel colonists and their Indian allies. The Native Americans hoped to push the American colonizers out of the region. At the end of the war, Langlade retired to his home in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Since he had operated a trading post at Green Bay since 1745 and settled there with his family, he is called the "Father of Wisconsin."
Early life and education.
Charles de Langlade was born in 1729 at Fort Michilimackinac, New France to Domitilde, the daughter of an Ottawa chief and sister of Nissowaquet, who became the Ottawa war chief. Charles's father was her second husband, Augustin Langlade (Augustin Mouet, sieur de Langlade), a French-Canadian fur trader. Domitilde was a widow with six children when they married in 1728. Augustin Langlade believed their marriage would provide him an advantage in the fur trade, by giving him a direct connection to the Odawa. The Ottawa were among the Algonquian Anishinaabeg peoples, who inhabited areas around the Great Lakes. As a child, Langlade grew up with Ottawa as his first language and identified with his mother's culture; he was also educated in French by Jesuit missionaries at the fort.
Life.
In the winter of 1751–1752, Langlade began assembling a war party of Odawa, Potawatomi, and Ojibwe warriors who traveled to Pickawillany for a raid. They were trying to discourage British trading in the area. In the confrontation on 21 June 1752, the Odawa killed, mutilated and consumed an Englishman and Miami chief Memeskia in a ritual sacrifice. This act aggravated existing tensions and contributed to colonial retaliation against the Odawa, and the French and Indian War (North American front of their Seven Years' War against France in Europe.
In 1755, he led a group from the Three Fires confederacy in the defense of Fort Duquesne (later Pittsburgh), where the French and their Indian allies triumphed over the British Edward Braddock and colonist George Washington at the Battle of the Monongahela. Langlade also took part in the Siege of Fort William Henry. Later he led a group of Ottawa warriors at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in the defense of Quebec.
In 1757, Langlade was made the second in command of the French forces at Fort Michilimackinac. Langlade surrendered the French forces at that fort to the British Army in 1761. Following the war and victory of Great Britain, Langlade transferred his allegiance to that country after it took control of French areas east of the Mississippi River. The following year he permanently moved with his family to the settlement now known as Green Bay, Wisconsin.
During the American Revolutionary War, Langlade led Great Lakes Indians as an ally of the British commanders in Canada; he was promoted to captain in the Indian Department. At the end of that war, Langlade returned to his home at Green Bay, then considered to be in the United States' Northwest Territory. He resided there until his death some time in the second half of 1801.

Daniel Rudd

Daniel Arthur Rudd (August 7, 1854December 3, 1933) was a Black Catholic journalist and early Civil Rights leader.
He is known for starting in 1885 what has been called "the first newspaper printed by and for Black Americans", the "Ohio Tribune"—which he later expanded into the "American Catholic Tribune", purported to be the first Black-owned national newspaper. The paper folded in 1897.
He also founded the Colored Catholic Congress in 1889, which held five meetings total and lasted until 1894.
Biography.
Early life.
Daniel Rudd was born on August 7, 1854, on Anatok Plantation in Bardstown, Kentucky to enslaved parents Robert and Elizabeth Rudd. Daniel and all 11 of his siblings were baptized in the Catholic Church.
Rudd was very religious, but it is unknown at what point in his life he decided to make the promotion of Catholicism his life's work. He was eventually emancipated from slavery and moved to Springfield, Ohio while still a young adult, sometime before 1876.
At the time, anti-Catholicism and political nativism were rampant, causing American Catholics to be physically threatened by Protestants with acts such as the burning of churches and convents. This led Rudd to decide to speak out on public schools in Springfield, as his fellow Catholics did not agree with the Protestant methods that were being used in them—which Catholics believed were insufficient to deal with the “materialism and formal unbelief” facing American youth.
In addition, Rudd helped desegregate Springfield public schools, advocating alongside the city's Black community beginning in 1881.
Career.
Rudd's journalism career started at the Sunday News. While there, he was a printer, reporter, and editor who was interested in following a Frederick Douglass-like advocacy that was aimed at protecting the civil rights of African Americans. He believed that the press played a large role in Black advancement. Rudd also thought that editors and journalists had the ability to persuade and educate Catholic, business and civic leaders.
Newspaper owner.
In 1885 Rudd began his first Catholic newspaper called the "Ohio Tribune", the first Black paper printed by and for the Black community. The fledgling, local weekly—with a limited scope—did not do well.
After only a year, Daniel moved the company to Cincinnati, where he started featuring articles that spoke out on Black issues such as segregation and discrimination. This new iteration, the "American Catholic Tribune;" this was the first Black-owned and operated national Catholic newspaper.
Rudd believed that the newspaper was important in promoting the church as a transformational institution that was capable of bringing equality and social justice for African Americans.“The Catholic Church alone can break the color line. Our people should help her to do it.”
"(American Catholic Tribune)"Cardinal Gibbons, archbishop of Baltimore (the preeminent episcopal see in the nation at the time), the archbishops of Cincinnati and Philadelphia, and the bishops of Covington, Columbus, Richmond, Vincennes, and Wilmington, were all listed on the masthead of the "Tribune" as endorsers.
Rudd was also a very good businessman who knew how to reach out and teach others who thought like him and wanted to push for the same rights and changes, such as Black Catholics and Protestants. In order for Rudd to make the changes he wanted, he needed income—which he gained by using the "Tribune" to promote his own printing school. This allowed him to expand his own business and dreams with printing, and start creating custom cards, letterheads, envelopes, invoices, pamphlets, books, legal documents, and advertisements.
That wasn't the only source of his income though, he also had newspaper subscriptions from Catholic and Protestant readers in Northern and Midwestern states. African Americans saw his will to make a change and fight for something they've believed in for quite some time, so many bishops, monsignors, laypersons, and even more Protestants gave him financial aid.
In 1891, he collaborated with Ida B. Wells and her "Memphis Free Speech", alongside the "Detroit Plaindealer", in hiring a correspondent to investigate the conditions of African Americans in the former Confederacy.
Rudd was successful for quite some time in his printing business, and by 1892, Rudd's newspaper was printing 10,000 copies. His successes led the Afro-American Press League (a consortium of the roughly two hundred Black newspapers being published in the country at the time) to ask Rudd to serve as its president. The enterprising Rudd served in this capacity even as he worked to keep his Queen City printing business and printing school afloat.
Colored Catholic Congress.
Rudd was very observant activist, watching and interacting with various organizations, discussing matters unique to the respective organizations. In particular, Rudd watched the workings of the German Roman Catholic Central Verein. In September 1887, Rudd attended a gathering in Chicago to address the group. Upon his return, he complained about the fact that the German and Irish were organized, but African Americans were not. He thought to gather Black Catholics to discuss various troubles in the Black community.
He built the idea of an English-speaking Catholic congress in the hope that all races would attend. Before the call, Rudd explained that those looking for freedom must first be the ones to “strike a blow”. He believed that the way to win the Black population to the Catholic church was to “find out how many Catholics we would have to start with and then put that force to work”.
In May 1888, Rudd called upon Black Catholics all over the country under the “Blessing of Holy Mother Church.” It was believed that this group could serve as a “leaven” of the race, lifting all African Americans both in the eyes of God and in humanity. It was well known that Rudd's advocacy reached farther than simple equality and justice but went beyond to national issues and problems such as legal segregation, equality for women, lynching, discrimination, employment, labor strife, and public-school segregation. He wanted to include all the injustices facing people of color everywhere, but specifically Africa and Latin America.
The Colored Catholic Congress held its first meeting in Washington, D.C. in January 1889, where Venerable Father Augustus Tolton, the nation's first openly-Black priest, celebrated Mass, and the 200-strong group met with President Grover Cleveland. The Congress met for five more years before disbanding. (An organization with a similar name and focus was founded in 1987.)
Collapse of the Tribune.
In 1897, there was a collapse of the "Tribune" due to the economic recession and increased competition from other businesses in the newspaper industry in Cincinnati and Philadelphia, as well as new Black Catholic papers in other parts of the country.
Later career.
By the end of his journalism career, Rudd had gone through many personal changes and found it best if he moved to the South and sought work in Mississippi and Arkansas. Rudd also may have been attracted to the South because of the economic opportunities that had opened up, allowing Black people to get cheap land. He worked in Bolivar County, Mississippi, as a lumber mill manager, and eventually he went to work for Scott Bond, Arkansas' first Black millionaire.
Rudd later found himself working as a business manager, accountant, inventor, and teacher. After a while, Rudd started to notice that the movement toward equality for African Americans was moving at a very slow pace, prompting him to accept Booker T. Washington’s self-help philosophy. That philosophy emphasized creating and building up businesses instead of the faith and churches, to achieve maximum economic advancement toward growth and change. That philosophy of self-help did not last very long after Rudd was invited to and participated at the NAACP convention in Cleveland in 1919.
Death.
In 1932 Rudd suffered a stroke, after which his family brought him back to his childhood home. He died there on December 3, 1933, at the age of 79.
He is buried in St. Joseph's Cemetery, adjacent to Rudd's childhood parish of the same name (now the Basilica of Saint Joseph Proto-Cathedral).
Personal life.
Many Catholic clergy and Rudd's close friends always described him as highly intelligent, a great businessman, and fluent in several languages, but one key thing that apparently stuck out about Rudd was his unbreakable faith in his Catholic upbringing and roots.
Legacy and honors.
Rudd remains a vaunted figure in the history of Black Catholicism, and is highly honored among its adherents as well as in the larger American Church.
In Fall 2020, Rudd's childhood parish—in conjunction with the Archdiocese of Louisville—announced plans to unveil a memorial historical marker at his gravesite on All Saints' Day of that same year, commemorating his impact on American Catholicism and the larger United States.

Joseph Mruk

Joseph Mruk (November 6, 1903 – January 21, 1995) was an American businessman and Republican politician from Buffalo, New York. He is most notable for his service as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1943 to 1945, and as mayor of Buffalo from 1950 to 1953.
Early life.
Mruk was of Polish heritage, and was born in Buffalo, New York, on November 6, 1903. He attended Public School 44 and Saint John Kanty School, and graduated from South Park High School in 1920. Mruk then began a career in the jewelry business by working at several stores in the Buffalo area. In 1926, he opened his own store, which he continued to operate until the 1970s.
Start of political career.
A Republican, Mruk ran unsuccessfully for member of the Erie County Board of Supervisors in 1933, and a seat on the Buffalo Common Council in 1935. He won a Common Council seat on his second attempt, and served as a district representative from 1937 to 1941. He was elected as an at-large member in 1941, and served until resigning in 1942.
Congressman.
In 1942, Mruk was elected to the U.S. House as a Republican, and served one term (1943-1945) as the representative of New York's 41st District. In Congress, Mruk questioned the Soviet Union's intentions for post-World War II Poland; as the Soviets were still part of the Allied effort against Nazi Germany, Mruk's concerns prompted assurances from President Franklin D. Roosevelt that Poland would not lose its sovereignty. Mruk also opposed creation of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, which Buffalo residents believed would hurt their city. As a result, he became unpopular with the Republican leadership, who endorsed his 1944 primary opponent, Edward J. Elsaesser
Continued career.
After leaving Congress, Mruk returned to active management of his jewelry store. In 1945, he was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor. In 1947, he again won election to the Buffalo Common Council, and he served until 1950, when he became mayor.
Buffalo mayor.
Mruk won the 1949 mayoral election against the Democratic nominee, Chief City Judge Joseph Hillery and two other candidates. His campaign was buoyed by Polish-Americans who usually voted for Democrats, but were unhappy that the Soviet Union had in fact made Poland part of the Eastern Bloc following World War II. Mruk served from January 1, 1950, to December 31, 1953, and his time in office was highlighted by his concentration on rebuilding the city's infrastructure, including streets, bridges and viaducts. He also worked to improve parks and recreation areas, instituted a lighted school house program to foster community involvement in the city's education system, and hired the city's first school crossing guards. Relying on his business experience to master the details of Buffalo's budgets and spending, Mruk took pride in effecting most of his programs without having to increase local taxes.
Later life.
In 1954, Mruk was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. House. In the 1950s and 1960s, Mruk served as a member of the state Commission on Pensions. In 1961, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for mayor. He closed his jewelry store in the mid 1970s, and in 1980 he moved to Florida, where he lived in retirement with his sister Clara and her husband.
Death and burial.
Mruk returned to Buffalo in 1988, and spent the last years of his life residing in a Lancaster nursing home. He died in Lancaster on January 21, 1995, and was buried at Saint Stanislaus Roman Catholic Cemetery in Cheektowaga.
Family.
Mruk was a lifelong bachelor. During his time as mayor, his sister acted as first lady during public ceremonies and other events.

Dandupalya

Dandupalya is a village in the taluk of Hoskote in the Bangalore Rural district of Karnataka, India. It lies near the Old Madras Road, National Highway 4, about 5 kilometers from the town of Hoskote and an hour's drive from Bangalore.
Dandupalya gang.
It has become notorious for the activities of the Dandupalya gang which between about 1996 and 2001 committed murders, rapes, and robberies. The gang numbered about 30 men and women, some of whom lived in Dandupalya. They are thought to have killed more than 80 people. Sixteen death sentences and four sentences of life imprisonment have been given to members of the gang, while others have received shorter prison sentences.
The main Dandupalya gang members belonged to a Kannada-speaking community whose ancestors had migrated from the Andhra Pradesh border area (in which they speak all languages of the border region) during the pre-independence era, around 1930. The Dandupalya gang come from line of dacoits starting with their great grandparents committing murders and dacoity. The childhood of Danduplaya gang members was stricken with hunger and bone biting poverty which led to the "dog eat dog" survival instinct. The gang when finally apprehended by the police would take in a surprising amount of physical torture but would break down and confess to their crimes only when lured with food, especially pork.
In 2012 a Kannada film, "Dandupalya", was made about the activities of the gang and launched a subsequent franchise.

USS Henderson (DD-785)

USS "Henderson" (DD-785) was a of the United States Navy, the second Navy ship of that name, and the first named for United States Marine Corps Major Lofton R. Henderson. The previous "Henderson" was named for Marine Corps Commandant Archibald Henderson.
"Henderson" was laid down by Todd Pacific Shipyards, Seattle, Washington, on 27 October 1944; launched on 28 May 1945; sponsored by Mrs. A. R. Early; and commissioned at Seattle on 4 August 1945.
1945–1964.
"Henderson" conducted shakedown cruise out of San Diego, then departed Seattle on 31 October for Hawaii. Upon her arrival on 7 November she operated as a screen ship for escort carriers in Hawaiian waters and conducted experimental sonar tests with submarines before returning to Naval Station San Diego on 23 April 1946. After divisional exercises off California she departed on 2 December 1946 for "Operation Highjump", an Antarctic exploration and test program. This operation included tests of clothing and equipment as well as mapping and weather work. "Henderson" reached Sydney, on 13 March 1947 and San Diego on 6 April 1947.
After two long cruises to the Pacific in support of U.S. occupation forces in Japan. "Henderson" departed San Diego on 5 August 1950 to join the United Nations forces in Korea. Arriving Yokosuka, Japan on 19 August she served as a screening ship for fast carrier forces whose aircraft flew ground support and other missions in Korea. As U.S. forces prepared to leap northward with the Inchon invasion, "Henderson" was with the assault forces. She steamed up Flying Fish Channel on 13 September, destroying mines and bombarding the Inchon waterfront preparatory to the invasion. The destroyers also traded blows with Communist shore batteries. The gunfire support group again entered the channel into Inchon Bay 14 to 15 September, softening up shore defenses. General of the Army Douglas MacArthur soon made signal as the Marines landed that day: "The Navy and Marines have never shone more brightly than this morning." "Henderson" remained on fire support duty at Inchon until 1 October.
The destroyer returned to screening duty after Inchon, first along the coast of Korea and then in the Formosa Strait. This duty continued until she departed Keelung on 20 March, arriving San Diego on 7 April 1951. After coastwise exercises and a cruise to Hawaii for training, "Henderson" sailed on 4 January 1952 for her second tour of duty in Korea. She arrived off Hŭngnam on 16 February to take part in the blockade of that port and the coastal areas to the north. Her duties included gunfire support and bombardment of industrial sites until 7 March, when she screened carrier off the coast of Japan. For the remainder of her tour "Henderson" operated with the fast carrier task forces around Korea and in the Formosa Strait. She departed Yokosuka on 25 July and arrived San Diego on 10 August 1952.
"Henderson" conducted training exercises off San Diego until 22 March 1953, when she departed for her third Korean tour. She took part in the siege of Wonsan harbor, supporting Korean troops with accurate and continuous gunfire, and conducted anti-submarine operations off Okinawa. The destroyer engaged in the vital coastal patrol, maintaining Allied control of the seas around Korea, until after the Korean armistice in July 1953. She arrived San Diego on 19 October 1953, after a total of 22 months of Korean duty.
Following Korea, "Henderson" established a pattern of cruises to the Far East, cruising to various crisis spots in the western Pacific for the next decade. Highlights of this phase of her service include protection of the Quemoy Islands from Communist aggression in September 1954, relief of Ceylonese flood victims in January 1958, and important fleet and individual exercises during her periods at sea. In 1959–60 Henderson continued to serve on "Formosa Patrol" protecting the Quemoy Islands and in May 1960 she served as station ship in Hong Kong. During her time in Hong Kong harbor she survived Typhoon Mary which was a direct hit on the area at that time.
FRAM I.
In the early 1960s "Henderson" was thoroughly modernized in the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program. She received the FRAM I refit at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, completed in April 1962. This modernization was to enable the World War II-destroyers to combat modern submarines.
This upgrade included rebuilding the ship's superstructure, engines, electronic systems, radar, sonar, and weapons. The No. 2 twin 5-inch turret was removed, as were all World War II torpedo launchers and 3-inch twin mounts. Upgraded systems included SQS-23 sonar, SPS-40 air search radar, two triple Mk 32 torpedo launchers, 8-cell ASROC box launcher, and QH-50C DASH ASW drone helicopter, with its own landing pad and hangar. 
The Gyrodyne QH-50C DASH was an unmanned anti-submarine helicopter, controlled remotely from the ship. The drone could carry two MK.44 homing ASW torpedoes. During this era the ASROC system had an effective range of only , but the DASH drone should allow the ship to deploy ASW attack to sonar contacts as far as away. . However, the FRAM refit did not improve defenses against aircraft, the air defense being taken over by the new guided missile-equipped ships.
1964–1980.
Commencing 11 August 1964, "Henderson" began annual cruises in Vietnamese waters, supporting the 7th Fleet amphibious and shore bombardment operations, and guarding aircraft carriers on "Yankee Station". She returned to Long Beach on 16 December, underwent modernization overhaul and intensive shore bombardment training, and returned to the intensified struggle in South Vietnam on 10 July 1965. During the next five months she ranged the South China Sea and Gulf of Tonkin while screening and serving on the gun line. In December she steamed to the Gulf of Siam, where she conducted shore bombardment missions against Viet Cong positions on the Ca Mau Peninsula. As escort for , the veteran destroyer departed Hong Kong on 26 December and arrived Long Beach on 13 January 1966.
"Henderson" spent the next year serving as an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) school ship out of San Diego and taking part in squadron exercises out of Long Beach. Late in July she joined in a massive, but unsuccessful air-sea search for the Hawaii-bound aircraft carrying Brigadier General Joseph Warren Stilwell, Jr., USA. After completing preparations for another WestPac deployment, she returned to the troubled waters of Southeast Asia in January 1967. Over the next four months she supported attack carrier operations and conducted more shore bombardment assignments. "Henderson" returned to Long Beach in mid-June, conducted ASW refresher training that summer and fall.
After a short restricted availability in early 1968, "Henderson" returned to Vietnam in April and resumed her familiar gunline and escort duties in the South China Sea. Interspersed with visits to Hong Kong, Subic Bay and Japan, "Henderson" remained there until 26 September when she arrived at Long Beach. During this tour of Asian waters "Henderson" also served with off the coast of North Korea in support of the captured as part of Operation Formation Star. "Pueblo" had previously been taken by the North Korean government while steaming in the Sea of Japan. "Henderson" received a regular overhaul alongside later in the year and a dry dock period at San Francisco January through March 1969, where she received new sonar and communications equipment.
After completing the overhaul in May, "Henderson" spent the summer and fall conducting refresher training before deploying to the Far East on 18 November. Caught in a storm near Midway Island, the destroyer suffered damage to the forward 5-inch gun mount and diverted to Yokosuka for repairs. After a brief yard period the destroyer then spent several weeks on patrol off the Korean peninsula, as tensions remained high following the shoot down of a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft the previous year. "Henderson" then spent three months off Vietnam, supporting riverine operations and participating in "Operation Ringmaster I". During this period, the destroyer also rescued six passengers from an SH-3 Sea King helicopter that crashed while en route from Da Nang to .
Returning to Long Beach on 8 May, "Henderson" underwent several months of inspections and certifications, which ultimately kept the warship in service in contrast to the mass 1970s decommissioning of many of her war-built sister ships. Following training and preparations that fall, "Henderson" departed for her sixth Vietnam deployment on 26 January 1971. Arriving in theater on 22 February, she served on the gunline and on "Yankee Station", both familiar assignments. In a change of pace, the destroyer participated in an ASW exercise at one point and successfully fired an exercise torpedo against diesel-electric submarine . In April, "Henderson" conducted a variety of duties, including serving as naval gunfire support school ship at the Tabones range in the Philippines, conducting a short surveillance patrol in the Paracel Islands and visiting ports in Taiwan. Departing the region on 30 June, the destroyer swung south for visits to Manus Island, Papua New Guinea; Cairns and Sydney, Australia; Auckland, New Zealand; and Pago Pago, American Samoa; before arriving home in Long Beach on 10 August.
The destroyer began another major overhaul at Long Beach that winter and began pre-deployment preparations starting in July 1972. The warship sailed on her seventh and final Vietnam tour on 16 November, arriving in Da Nang harbor on 14 December. She spent the next few weeks conducting naval gunfire support missions, including one gunnery duel with an enemy battery on Christmas Eve that earned her the Combat Action Ribbon. On New Year's Eve, the destroyer's motor whaleboat rescued four crewmen from a crashed SH-3 helicopter. After port visits to Singapore, Thailand and Hong Kong during truce talks, "Henderson" steamed into the Gulf of Tonkin for "Operation End Sweep" in April 1973. After helping minesweepers clear Haiphong harbor, the warship sailed for home, arriving in Long Beach on 26 May.
After participating in two fleet exercises that summer and fall, "Henderson" was retired from active duty and assigned to the Naval Reserve Fleet in Destroyer Squadron 27 (DesRon 27) on 1 October. She then moved into Long Beach Naval Shipyard for conversion to Navy distillate fuel. The active duty crew was also reduced in number and the ship only reached a full complement on drill weekends.
"Henderson" spent the next six years conducting reserve training operations out of Long Beach. The destroyer spent the majority of her time sailing in local operating areas, though the warship also conducted reserve unit training cruises to Pearl Harbor or the Pacific Northwest on an annual basis. Highlights of this period included visits to the Portland Rose Festival (where the ship was "streaked" on one occasion by two "lassies" on a nearby cabin cruiser), being struck by a practice torpedo fired by , and a series of excellent inspections that extended the service life of the destroyer through the end of the decade.
Pakistan service.
"Henderson" decommissioned on 30 September 1980, was struck from the Navy list that same day and sold to Pakistan on 1 October 1980. The destroyer served in the Pakistan Navy as PNS "Tughril" (167). She was renamed Nazim and transferred to the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (MSA) in 1998 at Karachi. The ship was finally decommissioned in 2001.
Awards.
"Henderson" received eight battle stars for Korean War service, seven battle stars for Vietnam War service, and shared in the Navy Unit Commendation given her task unit for its part in the Inchon landings.

River Rawthey

The River Rawthey is a river in Cumbria in northwest England.
The headwaters of the Rawthey are at Rawthey Gill Foot, where Rawthey Gill meets Haskhaw Gill. The source of Rawthey Gill is unclear, but is either on Knoutberry Haw or near to the East Tarns of Baugh Fell. Moving initially northwards, the Rawthey picks up Whin Stone Gill in Uldale before skirting round Bluecaster, after which the river runs south-southwest through Cautley. The Rawthey is joined by the Clough River, coming from Garsdale, near Dowbiggin, and, having run past Castleshaw Tower, the River Dee close to Sedbergh. The Rawthey joins the Lune at Stangerthwaite soon afterwards.
Most of the country through which the Rawthey runs is part of the historic West Riding of Yorkshire.

Russian nationalism

Russian nationalism () is a form of nationalism that promotes Russian cultural identity and unity. Russian nationalism first rose to prominence as a Pan-Slavic enterprise during the 19th century Russian Empire, and was repressed during the early Bolshevik rule. Russian nationalism was briefly revived through the policies of Joseph Stalin during and after the Second World War, which shared many resemblances with the worldview of early Eurasianist ideologues. 
The definition of Russian national identity within Russian nationalism has been characterized in different ways. One characterisation, based on ethnicity, asserts that the Russian nation is constituted by ethnic Russians, while another, the All-Russian nation, which developed in the Russian Empire, views Russians as having three sub-national groups within it, including Great Russians (those commonly identified as ethnic Russians today), Little Russians (Ukrainians), and White Russians (Belarusians). In the Eurasianist perspective, Russia is a distinctive civilization separate from both Europe and Asia, and includes ethnic non-Russians of Turkic and other Asiatic cultures.
History.
Russian Empire.
The Russian motto "Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality" was coined by Count Sergey Uvarov and it was adopted as the official ideology by Emperor Nicholas I. Three components of Uvarov's triad were:
Many works concerning Russian history, mythology and fairy tales appeared. Operas by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Mikhail Glinka and Alexander Borodin; paintings by Viktor Vasnetsov, Ivan Bilibin and Ilya Repin; and poems by Nikolay Nekrasov, Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy, among others, are considered masterpieces of Russian romantic nationalism.
Pan-Slavism and the Slavophile movement of the 19th century, led by such figures as Aleksey Khomyakov, Sergey Aksakov, and Ivan Kireyevsky drew a line between Western Europe and Russia, emphasizing Russia as a dominant regional power as well as spiritual unity among Slavs in their Orthodox religion, of which the Russian autocratic regime was the ultimate expression. However, their movement was suppressed by Tsar Nicholas I, a law and order royalist, who surveilled and suppressed the Slavophiles. The movement was revived in the 1870s by Konstantin Leontiev and Nikolay Danilevsky.
In the beginning of 20th century, new nationalist and rightist organizations and parties emerged in Russia, such as the Russian Assembly, the Union of the Russian People, the Union of Archangel Michael ("Black Hundreds") and others.
Soviet era.
Under the outlook of international communism that was especially strong at the time, Vladimir Lenin separated patriotism into what he defined as proletarian, socialist patriotism from bourgeois nationalism. Lenin promoted the right of all nations to self-determination and the right to unity of all workers within nations, but he also condemned chauvinism and claimed there were both justified and unjustified feelings of national pride. Lenin explicitly denounced conventional Russian nationalism as "Great Russian chauvinism", and his government sought to accommodate the country's multiple ethnic groups by creating republics and sub-republic units to provide non-Russian ethnic groups with autonomy and protection from Russian domination. Lenin also sought to balance the ethnic representation of leadership of the country by promoting non-Russian officials in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to counter the large presence of Russians in the Party. However, even during this early period of Soviet history, the Soviet government appealed to Russian nationalism when it needed support - especially on the Soviet borderlands in the Soviet Union's early years.
Since Russian patriotism served as a legitimizing prop of old order, Bolshevik leaders were anxious to suppress its manifestations and ensure its eventual extinction. They officially discouraged Russian nationalism and remnants of Imperial patriotism, such as the wearing of military awards received before the Civil War. Some of their followers disagreed; in non-Russian territories, Bolshevik power was often regarded as renewed Russian imperialism during 1919 to 1921. In 1922, the Soviet Union was formed with its members combined, but Russia was the largest and most populous member. After 1923, following Lenin's ideas, a policy of korenizatsiya, which provided government support for non-Russian culture and languages within the non-Russian republics, was adopted. However, this policy was not strictly enforced due to domination of Russians in Soviet Union. This domination had been formally criticized in the tsarist empire by Lenin and others as Great Russian chauvinism. Thomas Winderl wrote "The USSR became in a certain sense more a prison-house of nations than the old Empire had ever been. [...] The Russian-dominated center established an inequitable relationship with the ethnic groups it voluntarily helped to construct." Various scholars focused on the nationalist features that already existed during the Leninist period. Korenizatsiya's multinational construction weakened during Stalin's rule. Stalin's policies established a clear shift to Russian nationalism, starting from the idea that Russians were "first among equals" in the Soviet Union, escalating through the "nationalities deportations". According to scholar Jon K. Chang, the Bolsheviks "never made a clean break from Tsarist-era nationalist, populist and primordialist beliefs". Russian historian Andrei Savin stated that Stalin's policy shifted away from internationalism towards National Bolshevism in the 1930s. In a marked change from elimination of the class enemies, the nationality-based repressions declared entire ethnicities counter-revolutionary enemies, although "class dogmas" declaring targeted nationalities to be ideologically opposed to the Soviets were usually added.
Stalin reversed much of his predecessor's previous internationalist policies, signing orders for the exiling multiple distinct ethnic-linguistic groups which were branded as "traitors", including the Balkars, Crimean Tatars, Chechens, Ingush (see Deportation of the Chechens and Ingush), Karachays, Kalmyks, Koreans, and Meskhetian Turks, who were collectively deported to Siberia or Central Asia, where they were legally designated as "special settlers", which officially meant that they were second-class citizens with few rights and they were also confined within a small perimeter. Various historians see Stalin's deportations of minority and diaspora nationalities as evidence of the Russian nationalism of the Soviet state under Stalin. Chang wrote that the Soviet deportations of Koreans (and other diaspora, deported peoples such as Germans, Finns, Greeks and many others) illustrated the fact that in whole, essentialized views of race, that is, primordialism was carried over from the Russian nationalism of the Tsarist era. These Soviet tropes and biases produced and converted the Koreans (and the Chinese) into a decidedly, un-Marxist Soviet "yellow peril". The existence of racism lay in the fact that others could occasionally be seen or judged in accordance with a class line or they could be seen or judged on an individual basis but the Koreans could not. Norman M. Naimark believed that the Stalinist "nationalities deportations" were forms of national-cultural genocide. The deportations at the very least changed the cultures, way of life and world views of the deported peoples as the majority were sent to Soviet Central Asia and Siberia. According to historian Jeremy Smith, "As long as Stalin was alive... nationality policy was subject to arbitrary swings. The most disturbing feature of this period was the growth of official Anti-Semitism" including the campaign against "rootless cosmopolitans". Smith observed that "Speeches and newspaper articles raised the spectre of an international Jewish conspiracy to overthrow Soviet power" leading to the purges of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee and the Doctors' plot which was associated with the persecution of Jewish Moscow doctors in planned show trials. If Stalin had not died when he did, the alleged Doctors' plot would have led to the deportation of Jews to Siberia. Meanwhile, the defense of the country during World War II had led to the emergence of a new wave of national pride in the non-Russian republics which led to purges in those republics.
According to Evgeny Dobrenko, "Late Stalinism" after World War II was the transformation of Soviet society away from Marxism to demonize the idea of cosmopolitanism. He argued that Soviet actions up to 1945 could still in some way be explained by Leninist internationalism, but that the Soviet Union was turned into a Russian nationalist entity during the postwar years. Through a widespread study of Soviet literature, he found a vast increase in nationalist themes, cultural puritanism, and paranoia in publications during this eight year period making "Stalinism the heart of Sovietness" well after Stalin's death. Historian David Brandenberger contrasts russocentrism characteristic of this era with Russian nationalism. In his view, ethnic pride and promoted sense of Russian national identity didn't cross the threshold of nationalism as "the party hierarchy never endorsed the idea of Russian self-determination or separatism and vigorously suppressed all those who did, consciously drawing a line between the positive phenomenon of national identity formation and the malignancy of full-blown nationalist ambitions." To define the "pragmatic" combination of Russian national identity promotion in Marxist–Leninist propaganda and "symbolically abandoned" earlier proletarian internationalism, Brandenberger describes Stalin's regime with the term "National Bolshevism".
The creation of an international communist state under control of the workers was perceived by some as accomplishment of Russian nationalistic dreams. Poet Pavel Kogan described his feelings of the Soviet patriotism just before World War II:
According to Nikolai Berdyaev: 
In 1944, the Soviet Union abandoned its communist anthem The Internationale and adopted a new national anthem conveying a Russian-centered national pride in its first stanza, "An unbreakable union of free republics, Great Russia has sealed forever."
Although Khrushchev had risen up during Stalinism, his speech "On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences" and de-Stalinization signified a retreat from official anti-Semitism and Great Russian Chauvinism. Most, though not all nationalities deported by Stalin were allowed to return during Khrushchev, and the Soviet Union to a degree, resumed a policy of cultivating local national developments. Among the nationalities not allowed to return were Koreans and Crimean Tatars. The Kremlin during Khrushchev, generally favoring Russification overall, would attempt several variations of nationalities policy, favoring "korenizatsiya" (indigenization) in Central Asia without extending privileges to Russians. In Latvia however, regional communist elites tried to reinstate local "korenizatsiya" 1957-1959, but Khrushchev cracked down on these efforts, exiling Eduards Berklavs, and extended privileges to Russians in Latvia. Nonetheless, during Khrushchev's relatively more tolerant administration, Russian nationalism emerged as a slightly oppositional phenomenon within the Soviet elites. Alexander Shelepin, a Communist Party hardliner and KGB chairman, called for a return to Stalinism and policies more in line with Russian cultural nationalism, as did conservative writers like Sergey Vikulov. The Komsomol leadership also hosted several prominent nationalists such as Sergei Pavlovich Pavlov, an ally of Shelepin, while the Molodaya Gvardiya published numerous neo-Stalinist and nationalist works.
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Many nationalist movements, both radical and moderate, have arisen after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. One of the oldest and most popular is Vladimir Zhirinovsky's right-wing populist Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union and then Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, which had been a member of the State Duma since its creation in 1993. Rodina was a popular left-wing nationalist party under Dmitry Rogozin, which eventually abandoned its nationalist ideology and merged with the larger Russian socialist nationalist party A Just Russia.
One of the more radical, ultranationalist movements was Russian National Unity, a far-right group that organised paramilitary brigades of its younger members before it was banned in 1999. Before its breakup in late 2000 the Russian National Unity was estimated to have had approximately 20,000 to 25,000 members. Others include Battle Organization of Russian Nationalists which was involved in the murder of Stanislav Markelov, the neo-monarchist Pamyat, the Union of Orthodox Banner-Bearers, and the Movement Against Illegal Immigration, which revived the slogan "Russia for Russians." These parties organised an annual rally called the Russian March.
The Kremlin conducted a campaign against radical nationalists in the 2010s, and as a result, many of them are currently imprisoned, according to a Russian political scientist and a senior visiting fellow at the George Washington University Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies Maria Lipman. At the same time, Eurasianism has emerged as the dominant nationalist narrative in Putinist Russia. In a poll conducted by Levada Center in 2021, 64% of Russian citizens identify Russia as a non-European country; while only 29% regarded Russia to be part of Europe.
Sociologist Marcel Van Herpen wrote that United Russia increasingly relied on Russian nationalism for support following the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Nationalist political party Rodina cultivated ties with Eurosceptic, far-right and far-left political movements, supporting them financially and inviting them to Eurasian conferences in Crimea and Saint Petersburg.
However, the Kremlin scaled nationalism down out of fears that prominent figures such as Igor Girkin began to act independently, following a brief period of stirring activism that resulted in Russian men volunteering to fight in Donbas in 2014 and 2015, according to Lipman. In Lipman's view, the Kremlin's aim is to prevent emotions that "might get out of control and motivate people to act independently".
Academics Robert Horvath and Anton Shekhovtsov described how the Kremlin uses far-right groups to promote Russian nationalist or anti-western views in Russia and abroad. According to Horvath, the Kremlin cultivated neo-Nazis who reject democratic institutions and imposed restrictions on mainstream nationalists who may support free elections. 
In November 2018, Vladimir Putin described himself as "the most effective nationalist", explaining that Russia is a multiethnic and multireligious state and preserving it as such serves the interests of the ethnic Russians. He remarked that Russian ethnicity didn't exist at some point and it was formed by multiple Slavic tribes.
According to Michael Hirsh, a senior correspondent at "Foreign Policy":
Putin's views evolved over time. In his speech on 18 June 2004 at the international conference "Eurasian Integration: Trends of Modern Development and Challenges of Globalization", Putin said about the problems hindering integration: "I would say that these problems can be formulated very simply. This is great-power chauvinism, this is nationalism, this is the personal ambitions of those on whom political decisions depend, and, finally, this is just stupidity, ordinary cavemen's stupidity".
Since around 2014, the Putin regime has adopted Russian nationalism and great-power chauvinism as its main policy. In July 2021, Putin published an essay titled "On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians", in which he states that Belarusians, Ukrainians and Russians should be in one All-Russian nation as a part of the Russian world and are "one people" whom "forces that have always sought to undermine our unity" wanted to "divide and rule".
In 2020 Russian Constitution went through a significant reform which, among other changes, added a notion of Russians being "state-forming nation" of the Russian Federation, gaining a dominating role over other ethnic groups.
In a speech on 21 February 2022, following the deployment of Russian troops in the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, Putin made a number of claims about Ukrainian and Soviet history, including stating that modern Ukraine was created by the Bolsheviks in 1917 as part of a communist appeasement of nationalism of ethnic minorities in the former Russian Empire, specifically blaming Vladimir Lenin for "detaching Ukraine from Russia". Putin spoke of the "historic, strategic mistakes" that were made when in 1991 the USSR "granted sovereignty" to other Soviet republics on "historically Russian land" and called the entire episode "truly fatal". He described Ukraine as being turned into the "anti-Russia" by the West.
In his speech in November 2023, Putin claimed that the Mongol-Tatar yoke resulting from the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus' was better for the Russian people than Western domination, saying: “Alexander Nevsky received a jarlyk [permission] from the khans of the Golden Horde to rule as a prince, primarily so that he could effectively resist the invasion of the West." According to Putin, the decision to submit to the Tatar khans preserved "the Russian people - and later all the peoples living on the territory of our country."
Extremist nationalism.
Extremist nationalism in Russia is used in reference to many far-right and a few far-left ultra-nationalist movements and organizations. In Russia, the term "nationalism" is frequently used in reference to extremist nationalism. However, it is frequently conflated with "fascism" in Russia. While the meaning of this terminology does not exactly match the formal definitions of fascism, the common denominator is chauvinism. In all other respects, the positions vary over a wide spectrum. Some movements hold a political position in which they believe that the state must be an instrument of nationalism (such as the National Bolshevik Party, headed by Eduard Limonov), while others (for example, Russian National Unity) promote the use of vigilantist tactics against the perceived "enemies of Russia" without participating in politics.
In the 1990s and the early 2000s ultranationalist/xenophobic movement was represented by neo-Nazi skinheads, Orthodox–Christian nationalists and national-Imperial forces such as Liberal Democratic Party of Russia headed by Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
In 1997, the Moscow Anti-Fascist Center estimated that 40 (nationalist) extremist groups were operating in Russia. The same source reported 35 extremist newspapers, the largest among these being "Zavtra". In spite of repression by governmental authorities, a far-right extremist movement has established itself in 
Russia.
Neopaganism and the Aryan myth.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Aryan myth has gained publicity in Russia. Numerous series of collections of works by popularizers of the Aryan idea are published ("Secrets of the Russian Land", "The True History of the Russian People", etc.). They are available in Russian bookstores and municipal and university libraries. These works are not marginal: they have a circulation of tens of thousands of copies (or millions, for example, for books by Alexander Asov), their content is involved in the formation of the worldview basis of a stratum of the population regarding ancient history.
Authors who develop the Aryan theme are often employees of new amateur academies and geopolitical institutions. Only a small number of them have a history degree. Most of them were educated in the field of technology and exact sciences.
The "Aryan" idea in the version of Slavic neo-paganism (the origin of the Slavs from the "Aryans" from Hyperborea or Central Asia, also called the "race of white gods"; the connection of the Slavs with India; ancient pre-Christian Slavic "runic" books; origin from the "Slavic-Aryans" of the ancient civilizations; the neo-pagan symbol "Kolovrat" as an ancient Slavic symbol; a variant of the alien origin of the "Aryan-Hyperboreans") was popularized in the "documentary" programs of the REN TV television network, including broadcasts by Igor Prokopenko and Oleg Shishkin.
In a number of areas of Russian nationalism, the "Aryan" idea is used to justify the right to the territory of modern Russia or the former Soviet Union, which is declared to be the habitat of the ancient "Slavo-Aryans". In a number of post-Soviet countries, "Aryanism" is cultivated by neo-pagan movements that are not satisfied with the real history of their peoples. The pre-Christian past is idealized, allowing one to present one's ancestors as a great victorious people. The choice falls on paganism, since, according to these ideologists, it is endowed with an "Aryan heroic principle" and is not burdened by Christian morality, calling for mercy and ignoring the idea of the priority of "blood and soil".
Christianity is seen by neo-pagans as a hindrance to a successful "racial struggle". The rejection of Christianity and the return to the "ethnic religion", the "faith of the ancestors", according to neo-pagans, will help overcome the split of the nation and return to it the lost moral "Aryan" values that can lead it out of the crisis. Neo-pagans call for a return to the "Aryan worldview" in the name of public health, which is being destroyed by modern civilization. Within this discourse, the slogans of the Conservative Revolution of the 1920s are once again becoming popular. Declaring themselves "Aryans", the radicals seek to fight for the "salvation of the white race", which results in attacks on "migrants" and other representatives of non-titular nationalities.
In many areas of Slavic neo-paganism (rodnovery), Slavs or Russians are credited with historical and cultural or racial superiority over other peoples. This ideology includes Russian messianism, with the Russian people being considered the only force capable of resisting world evil and leading the rest of the world. The "Aryan" idea sets before Russia the task of building an analogue of the "Fourth Reich", a new "Aryan" empire on a global scale. The Russian Aryan myth rejects any territorial disputes, since the Russian people are depicted as absolutely autochthonous throughout Eurasia.
Less common is the model of an ethno-national state associated with the separatism of certain Russian regions. The fragmentation of Russia into several Russian national states, devoid of ethnic minorities, is supposed. In both cases, it is believed that the cohesion of society in the new state should be built on a single "native faith".
Modern Russian neo-paganism took shape in the second half of the 1970s and is associated with the activities of antisemitic supporters of the Moscow Arabist Valery Yemelyanov (neopagan name - Velemir) and the former dissident and neo-Nazi activist Alexey Dobrovolsky (neopagan name - Dobroslav).
Russian nationalism and ethnic minorities.
The issue of Russian nationalism with regard to Russia's relationship with its ethnic minorities has been extensively studied since the rapid expansion of Russia from the 16th century onward. While there is no English word which differentiates the meaning of the word "Russian", in the Russian language, the term is used to refer either to ethnic Russians ("Русские") or to Russian citizens ("Россияне"). 
The Russian conquest of Muslim Kazan is considered the first event which transformed Russia from a nearly homogenous nation into a multi-ethnic society. Over the years and from the territorial base which it gained in Kazan, Russia managed to conquer Siberia and Manchuria and it also expanded into the Caucasus. At one point, Russia managed to annex a large territory of Eastern Europe, Finland, Central Asia, Mongolia and, on other occasions, it encroached into Turkish, Chinese, Afghan and Iranian territories. Various ethnic minorities have become increasingly viral and integrated into mainstream Russian society, and as a result, they have created a mixing picture of racial relationships in the modern Russian nationalist mindset. The work of understanding different ethnic minorities in relation to the Russian state can be traced back to the work of Philip Johan von Strahlenberg, a Swedish prisoner of war who settled in Tsarist Russia and became a geographer.
The concept is strongly understood by various minorities in Russia. The Volga Tatars and the Bashkirs, the two main Muslim peoples in Russia, have long been lauded as model minorities in Russia, and historically, they have been viewed more positively by the Russian nationalist movement. Furthermore, Tatar and Bashkir imams have worked to spread the Russian nationalist ideology in a way which is in accordance with their Islamic faith.
In the Caucasus, Russia gained a significant amount of support from the Ossetians, one of the few Christian-based peoples which live in the mountainous region. There was also a strong amount of support for Russia among Armenians and Greeks, a sentiment which was largely due to the fact that the Armenians, the Greeks and the Orthodox government of Russia all adhered to similar religions.
The Koryo-saram (Koreans) have also been regarded as a model minority in Russia, and as a result, they have been encouraged to colonize sparsely populated parts of Russia, this policy was first implemented during the Tsarist era and it continues to be implemented today, because Koreans were not hostile to Russian nationalism. Although the Korean diaspora in the Russian Far East was loyal to the Soviet Union and also underwent cultural Russification, Koreans were deported to Central Asia by the Soviet government (1937–1938), based on the erroneous charge that they were aligned with the Japanese. When Khrushchev allowed deported nationalities to return to their homelands, the Koreans remained restricted and they were not rehabilitated. On 26April 1991 the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, under its chairman Boris Yeltsin, passed the law "On the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples" with Article 2 denouncing all mass deportations as "Stalin's policy of defamation and genocide".
Ukrainians in Russia have been largely integrated and the majority of them pledged loyalty over Russia, while some Ukrainians managed to occupy significant positions in Russian history. Bohdan Khmelnytsky is one of Russia's most celebrated figures who brought Ukraine to the Tsardom of Russia throughout the Pereyaslav Council. Ukrainian Prince Alexander Bezborodko was responsible for manifesting the modern diplomacies of Russia under the reign of Catherine the Great. Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, Konstantin Chernenko and Mikhail Gorbachev also had some ancestral connections to Ukraine. In addition, Russia's biggest opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, is also of paternally of Ukrainian origin as well as being a potential Russian nationalist.
Akhmad Kadyrov and his son Ramzan defected to Russia during the Second Chechen War, pledging loyalty to Putin while maintaining a degree of autonomy for the Chechen Republic, while using this opportunity for securing funds for their regime from Russian federal money. Vladislav Surkov, who is of Chechen origin, was the chief figure who initiated the idea of Russian managed democracy, in which nationalism is a part of the ideology.
Georgians in Russia do not have a positive view of Russian nationalism, and as a result, vast majority of them maintain a neutral or negative opinion. However, Russian expansion into the Caucasus mountains has been driven by Georgian figures such as Pavel Tsitsianov, who initiated the conquest of the Caucasus. Pyotr Bagration was another Georgian who went on to become one of Russia's most celebrated heroes. Soviet Union's transformation into a superpower was the work of yet another Russified Georgian, Joseph Stalin, who had a complex relationship with Russian nationalism.
Some of Dagestan's revered figures have long been respected by Russian nationalists, such as Rasul Gamzatov, who is one of Russia's most respected poets despite his Avar origin. Khabib Nurmagomedov's rise to popularity and fame has earned a divisive opinion among Russians and Dagestanis. Putin loyalist Ramzan Kadirov has made controversial statements attacking the legendary Dagestani leader Imam Shamil, who led the armed resistance of Caucasian Imamate against Russian imperialism during the Murid War. This has resulted in an outpouring of criticism in Dagestanis, who fear that Kadyrovites seek to control the Kizlyarsky and Botlikhsky districts in Dagestan. The comments by Kadyrov are widely seen as part of government attempts to demean religious and national leaders of Russia's Muslim minority who defended their homeland from Imperial Russia.
Germans in Russia have long been treated with privileges under the Tsarist government and many Germans became prominent in Russian politics, education and economy, including the Tsarist House of Romanov, which also included many German-based figures, most notably Catherine the Great. Many Germans fought in the Russian Civil War and regarded themselves as Russian nationalists. The Baltic German nobility were significantly loyal to the Russian Empire, but were resistant to nationalism until the Russian Revolution, identifying mainly as members of the Russian nobility.
A number of critics believe the rise of Russian nationalism is belated. The reason is the passive attitude of Russians towards other peoples inhabiting Russia. Passivity arose because of the huge number of peoples of Russia, which were much smaller in number than Russians. They were easy to dominate and subdue.

Morocco national cricket team

The Moroccan national cricket team was the team that represented the Kingdom of Morocco in international cricket. The team is governed by Federation Royale Marocaine De Cricket.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, any Twenty20 matches played between Morocco and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 would have been full T20I, though prior to July 2019 Morocco had not participated in any T20I matches. Owing to violations against the ICC constitution, Morocco were expelled from the ICC in July 2019.
International history.
Their international debut came in 2006 when they took part in Division Three of the African region of the ICC World Cricket League. They finished fifth in the eight team tournament. Their most recent international activity has been in the ICC-Africa Division 3 tournament in Benoni, South Africa where the team finished 6th.
Morocco boasted an ICC approved ground capable of hosting full internationals, the National Cricket Stadium in Tangier. It hosted a One Day International triangular tournament, the Morocco Cup in 2002, where Sri Lanka won ahead of South Africa and Pakistan.

Slim-fit pants

Slim-fit pants or skinny jeans (when made of denim) are tight trousers that have a snug fit through the legs and end in a small leg opening that can be anywhere from 9" to 20" in circumference, depending on size. Other names for this style include drainpipes, stovepipes, tight pants, cigarette pants, pencil pants, skinny pants, gas pipes, skinnies, and tight jeans.
"Skinny pants" taper completely at the bottom of the leg, whereas "drainpipes" are skinny but then the lower leg is straight instead of tapering and so they are often slightly baggier at the bottom of the leg than skinny jeans. In some very skinny styles, zippers are needed at the bottom of the leg to facilitate pulling them over the feet because the leg opening is so small. Stretch denim, with anywhere from 2% to 4% spandex, may be used to allow jeans to have a "super-slim fit". Skinny jeans come in a variety of colors and styles.
History.
Origins.
Before the 18th century, European men wore breeches and hose. In Tudor times, these breeches were loose-fitting, but by the 1660s, tight breeches were fashionable. These were popularised by Frenchmen at the court of Louis XIII, as part of the three piece suit that also included a type of frock coat called a Justacorps, a tricorne hat, a powdered wig, and a long waistcoat. During the Restoration era, the tighter breeches were introduced to England, and the rest of Europe, because the cut was deemed more flattering to the leg.
From the 16th until the 19th century, the Mughlai nobility attired themselves in tight-fitting churidars which were worn tied below the knee. These trousers, and other elements of traditional clothing like the shalwar kameez, were often worn by Englishmen working in India, especially officers of the East India Company.
The early 19th century.
Tight-fitting trousers were fashionable from 1805 until 1850, being descended from the loose work trousers worn as a political statement by Sans-Culottes during the French Revolution. These "pantaloons," popularised by Regency era Englishmen such as Beau Brummel, were worn high on the waist and tailored to accentuate the leg like the breeches previously fashionable among the upper class. Pantaloons were tied (or buttoned) around the ankle and commonly put into boots.
Decline, 1890–1940.
Pants, which had come to mean tight-fitting trousers, but now just a synonym, fitted more loosely from the 1840s onwards as mass-production replaced tailoring. Beginning in the Edwardian era and continuing into the 1920s, baggy "Oxford" or "collegiate" trousers and plus fours were fashionable among the younger generation. As the name suggests, Oxford bags originated at the UK's elite universities, where young upper class men pursued an active, sports-centred lifestyle.
1950s.
Drainpipe trousers re-emerged in the 1950s, with popular Western stars such as the singing cowboy Roy Rogers, The Lone Ranger, The Cisco Kid, Zorro and Gene Autry and actresses Marilyn Monroe and Sandra Dee wearing their pants very slim to the ankle from 1955 onwards. Tapered jeans became most notable with country music stars and with the birth of rock and roll in the 1950s, when Elvis Presley donned slim-fitting jeans and shocked the country.
1960s.
In the early 1960s, drainpipes were worn by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and other rock music acts. Fashion icon Audrey Hepburn also raised the popularity of drainpipe jeans. Slim fitting pants and jeans were worn not just by members of the teenage Mod or greaser subculture but also ordinary people. By 1962, Sears were selling tight jeans made from "stretch" denim that incorporated elastane. The trend lasted until the end of the 1960s when "hippie" culture gave rise to flared pants and bell bottom jeans.
1970s.
In the early 1970s, glam rock and rockabilly bands reviving the Teddy Boy look popularised drainpipe jeans in contrast to the flared trousers worn by hippies. Red tartan drainpipe jeans (as they were then called) were popular in the punk subculture of the late 1970s, and were worn by many bands and scene leaders such as Ramones, The Clash and Sex Pistols.
1980s.
Skin-tight acid-washed jeans were also popular in the 1980s with most heavy metal bands, and in particular those in the thrash metal scene, such as Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer. This was the trend for those who did not wear spandex, which was popular with the dominant heavy metal scene at the time. They were often worn with white high-top sneakers or basketball shoes like Converse. By the late 1980s, drainpipe pants were largely superseded by straight leg jeans like Levi 501s, but remained popular among fans of hard rock until the 1990s. Tight-fitting jeans were also worn by pop stars like Michael Jackson and Freddie Mercury. The 1980s also saw the revival of "stretch jeans," pioneered and popularized in the United States by Steven Kohn and Sal Parasuco.
1990s.
By the early 1990s, many glam metal bands such as Poison, Mötley Crüe, Kiss, Bon Jovi, and Slaughter, abandoned spandex and wore form fitted jeans. Tight jeans were also worn by members of the casual subculture from the late 80s until the mid 90s, including Ewan McGregor in "Trainspotting". However, with the rise of grunge and hip-hop music in the mid 1990s and the post thrash movement, drainpipe jeans quickly went out of fashion in favor of baggy carpenter jeans, as worn by hip-hop/rap acts such as Kris Kross, Another Bad Creation, and Snoop Dogg. Flared jeans also made a comeback from the mid-1990s onward, furthering the move away from the drainpipe styles.
2000s.
The 2000s saw the continued rejection of slim-fitting pants and jeans throughout the early and middle years in mainstream fashion. However, in 2005, fitted pants were reintroduced to the mainstream market for women. This new style of pants was called "skinny jeans". During its first year, skinny jeans were only sold online, and they were not available in stores. Initially, they were not well received by the public, though there were some early adopters. It was not until 2006 that skinny jeans gained more steam in fashion world, and by this time skinny jeans were being sold at shopping malls. Throughout 2007 skinny jeans received more mainstream exposure as fashion trends started moving away from the bell bottoms and baggy pants which had been dominant for the previous 10 years. Men's skinny jeans were introduced in the late 2000s and became the norm by 2009.
2010s and 2020s.
Skinny jeans first spread to men's fashion in 2009. This has continued into the 2010s, entering the mainstream fashion in 2011. They eventually became one of the decade's defining fashion pieces for both men and women. Many men expanded their wardrobe to include tight-fitting chino trousers coming with variety of colors, but often in khaki, brown or white. Women's skinny jeans also came in various colors, often neutral colors like khaki and white. Starting in the mid-2010s, high-waisted women’s skinny jeans became stylish. 
In the mid to late 2010s, skinny jeans peaked in popularity. Starting in the late 2010s, straight legged jeans would increase in popularity and lead to a steady decline in skinny jeans popularity. Stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated a trend toward more comfortable, loose-fitting clothing and athleisure apparel.
Medical problems.
Victorian doctors theorised that tight trousers caused an outbreak of apoplexy in New York. However, the veracity of this claim is questionable, given the often speculative nature of early modern medicine.
In modern times, some physicians believe tight trousers may cause numbness due to compression of nerves. For example, this may affect the outer thigh in the condition meralgia paraesthetica.
A recent study by Korean doctors suggests that skinny jeans can cause varicose veins. Among men, tight trousers may also cause dyspermia due to overheating of the testes.
A study in 2015 documented the case of skinny jeans causing rhabdomyolysis, bilateral peroneal and tibial neuropathies.
Bans and violence.
Some opposers of skinny or tight pants believe that they are immoral, immodest, overtly sexual, or a threat to local traditions. In conservative regions of the Southern United States and some other western countries, like Russia, it was often linked to homosexuality as of the 2000s.
A number of schools around the world have banned students from wearing overly slim pants like "skinny jeans". In the United States, the ban in Brigham Young University–Idaho caught the attention of mainstream media in 2011; the ban was lifted in that college the same year. In one case, a student was banned from taking an exam for wearing skinny jeans. In India some colleges have advised against or prohibited tight pants for female students, citing their own safety. In Tanzania it was reported a female parliament member was asked to leave the parliament for wearing "skin-tight pants", with the parliament speaker calling it 'non-parliamentary attire'. There have also been reported incidents in the world of court defendants being turned away for wearing such "unappropriate" slim pants. Female police officers in Mexico have reported becoming victims of sexism for outfits which included tight pants.
In the 2010s, several religious fundamentalist governments, especially radical Islamists, disapproved of tight trousers. In Saudi Arabia, the police were reportedly instructed to arrest teenagers who dress this way because the tight jeans are seen as un-Islamic and, when worn by men, a sign of homosexuality. In the Gaza strip, Palestinian youths caught wearing skinny jeans have been arrested and beaten by the Hamas police. Incidents of wearers being imprisoned or fined have been reported in places including Sudan and in territories that were controlled by ISIL in 2015. In Israel, a number of Rabbis signed a decree prohibiting devout Jewish men from wearing tight pants.
Some people wearing them have been met with violence, such as in 2012 when unknown individuals murdered between twelve and one hundred people in Iraq—among them were "emos" of both sexes wearing tight clothes and emo hairstyles. There has also been a case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where security officers attacked a number of women who were wearing tight pants.
Since the Cold War, many Communist dictatorships have disapproved of skinny jeans. In Russia, they were associated with anticommunist juvenile delinquents like the Stilyagi beatniks during the 1950s or the so-called "hairies" during the 1960s. In Cuba during the late 2010s and early 2020s, law enforcement have used tight pants as a marker for male homosexuality in the context of arresting. In May 2021, North Korea banned "skinny jeans" and a number of other fashion items for its citizens, citing it as "capitalistic".

Pennsylvania Route 12

Pennsylvania Route 12 (PA 12) is a state highway located in Berks County in eastern Pennsylvania. The western terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 222 (US 222) and US 422 in Wyomissing. Its eastern terminus is PA 662 in the community of Pricetown in Ruscombmanor Township. In the Reading area, PA 12 is a four-lane freeway called the Warren Street Bypass that heads northeast through urban areas, coming to interchanges with multiple roads including PA 183, PA 61, and US 222 Business (US 222 Bus.). In Alsace Township, the route becomes a two-lane undivided road with at-grade intersections called Pricetown Road and continues northeast through rural areas, intersecting PA 73 before ending at PA 662.
Pricetown Road originally existed in the 18th century as a road to link farmers in Pricetown to markets in Reading. The Warren Street Bypass was first planned in 1949 as a widening of Warren Street in Reading leading to a new bridge over Tulpehocken Creek to Wyomissing. In the 1950s, the Warren Street Bypass was completed from Wyomissing northeast to US 222 (Allentown Pike, now 5th Street Highway) north of Reading, providing a bypass of Reading. US 222 was routed onto this bypass by 1976, with the Warren Street Bypass extended northeast to Pricetown Road in 1980. The part of the Warren Street Bypass northeast of US 222 along with Pricetown Road became State Route 2026 (SR 2026) when the Location Referencing System was established. In 1998, PA 12 was assigned to its current alignment following the rerouting of US 222 onto a new bypass of Reading.
Route description.
PA 12 begins at an interchange with US 222 and US 422 in the borough of Wyomissing. Southwest of this interchange, the Warren Street Bypass continues as part of southbound US 222 and westbound US 422. US 222 northbound continues northwest and US 422 eastbound continues southeast on the West Shore Bypass. PA 12 does not have access to northbound or from southbound US 222 at this interchange. From US 222/US 422, the route heads northeast on the four-lane divided Warren Street Bypass. PA 12 crosses Tulpehocken Creek into the city of Reading and heads through commercial areas. Along this stretch, the route has no cross traffic, with access to some local streets as well as businesses while access to other local cross streets is blocked by barricades. The road comes to an interchange with PA 183, with access provided from right-in/right-out ramps to Butler Street and Lehigh Street in the eastbound direction and to Carbon Street and Lackawanna Street in the westbound direction. The PA 183 interchange provides access to Reading Regional Airport, an airport with charter flights that is also home to the Mid-Atlantic Air Museum. Following this interchange, the route becomes a freeway and heads near residential neighborhoods and turns north, running to the west of Norfolk Southern's Reading Line. PA 12 crosses the Schuylkill River and comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with River Road.
From here, the freeway curves to the northeast and passes under the Reading Line, heading into commercial areas within Muhlenberg Township and coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange with PA 61 that has an eastbound exit and a westbound entrance along with an eastbound entrance from northbound PA 61. The exit to southbound PA 61 provides access to FirstEnergy Stadium, the home ballpark of Minor League Baseball's Reading Fightin Phils. The route passes under Norfolk Southern's Pottsville Branch and comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 222 Bus.; this interchange provides access from westbound PA 12 to PA 61 and northbound US 222. Past this interchange, the freeway continues near more development, reaching a diamond interchange with 11th Street. PA 12 heads into more wooded surroundings and curves northeast. The route comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with Spring Valley Road and continues into Alsace Township, where the freeway ends.
After the freeway ends, PA 12 becomes a two-lane undivided road with at-grade intersections called Pricetown Road, continuing northeast through forested areas with some homes and businesses. The road passes through the community of Alsace Manor before crossing into Ruscombmanor Township, where it intersects PA 73 in the community of Breezy Corner. Past this intersection, the route continues through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. PA 12 ends at an intersection with PA 662 in the community of Pricetown, where Pricetown Road continues northeast as SR 2026, an unsigned quadrant route, to a five-way intersection with Lobachsville Road, Lyons Road, Henry Road, and Deysher Road in the community of New Jerusalem in Rockland Township.
In 2016, PA 12 had an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 59,000 vehicles between the US 222/US 422 and PA 183 interchanges to a low of 8,600 vehicles between PA 73 and Walnuttown Road. The portion of PA 12 from PA 61 to Antietam Road is a part of the National Highway System.
History.
Pricetown Road dates back to the 18th century as a road linking the village of Pricetown to Reading. The road was used by farmers in the Pricetown area who traveled to Reading to buy and sell wares. Pricetown was settled in 1754 and grew into a village with three taverns and a general store that served the trade to and from Reading. In the 19th century, Pricetown Road was used to transport Montana horses from Temple to country auctions in the area. Pricetown Road was originally an unpaved road. Warren Street in Reading was constructed by 1920, running from Fayette Street near the Tulpehocken Creek east to a dead end near the Schuylkill River. In 1927, Pricetown Road was paved in concrete. The road was straightened at the Walnuttown Road intersection by 1940.
In 1949, plans were made to build a four-lane bridge across Tulpehocken Creek at Warren Street. As part of this plan, Warren Street was to be widened from the proposed bridge to Schuylkill Avenue. This widened Warren Street was envisioned to become part of a bypass route of Reading. The bridge and widening were approved with the provision that Warren Street only be widened as far as Schuylkill Avenue as not to build a bypass route through a residential area. Construction on the bridge and the Warren Street Bypass between US 422 (Harrisburg Pike, now Penn Avenue) and PA 83 (now PA 183, Schuylkill Avenue) began in 1950. In 1953, the Park Avenue Extension (which extended Park Avenue in Wyomissing to the bypass) and the Warren Street Bypass from US 422 in Wyomissing to Tulpehocken Creek, along with the Tulpehocken Creek bridge, was finished, with a continuation of the Warren Street Bypass northeast from PA 83 to US 222 (Allentown Pike, now 5th Street Highway) proposed. Construction on the extension of the Warren Street Bypass to US 222 began in 1956 with the process of widening of the existing Warren Street. The PA 83 bridge over the bypass was built in 1957. In 1959, the Warren Street Bypass extension to US 222 was opened to traffic with the portion of Warren Street between Tulpehocken Creek and PA 83 widened to four lanes. The Warren Street Bypass included an interchange with the under-construction Reading Bypass (now US 422, West Shore Bypass) southwest of Tulpehocken Creek when it opened in 1959.
 An extension of the Warren Street Bypass from US 222 to Pricetown Road was proposed in 1962. Two routes for the extension were proposed: one following a more southerly route as it does today and another following a more northerly route along Spring Valley Road, passing near the Bernhart Reservoir. The extension of the bypass was intended to provide access to a growing industrial park. In 1966, plans were made to make the portion of the Warren Street Bypass through the Glenside neighborhood of Reading limited-access by eliminating at-grade intersections with local streets, resulting in the streets coming to a dead end at the bypass. The more southerly route for the Warren Street Bypass extension between US 222 and Pricetown Road was selected by 1969. On November 15, 1975, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved for US 222 to be routed to bypass Reading, with the route following the Warren Street Bypass between US 422 in Wyomissing and Allentown Pike. In 1976, construction began on the extension of the Warren Street Bypass between US 222 and Pricetown Road. The portion of the Warren Street Bypass between Spring Valley Road and Pricetown Road was completed in July 1979 while the portion between 11th Street and Spring Valley Road was completed in December 1979. In 1980, the remainder of the Warren Street Bypass extension between US 222 and 11th Street was completed.
With the establishment of the Location Referencing System for state roads in 1987, the Warren Street Bypass between US 222 and Pricetown Road, along with the entire length of Pricetown Road northeast to New Jerusalem, became SR 2026. In 1998, US 222 was rerouted to a freeway alignment northwest of Reading following the completion of the Park Road Corridor in October of that year; the PA 12 designation was given to the Warren Street Bypass northeast of US 222/US 422 in Wyomissing as well as to SR 2026 up to the intersection with PA 662 in December of that year.
There are plans to improve the section of PA 12 in Alsace Township, including the construction of a roundabout at the intersection with Elizabeth Avenue/Hillview Road. Construction on this improvement project is planned to begin in 2026 and be finished in 2027.

St Vincent Place

St Vincent Place is a heritage precinct in Albert Park, Victoria, Australia.
St Vincent Place is bounded by Park Street, Cecil Street, Bridport Street, Cardigan Place and Nelson Road. It is bisected by Montague Street, allowing the passage of trams on route 1. It is an example of nineteenth century residential development around the large landscaped square St Vincent Gardens It is characterised by beautiful original terrace houses of the 1860s and 1870s.
According to the Victorian Heritage Register, ""The St Vincent Place precinct was first designed in 1854 or 55, probably by Andrew Clarke, the Surveyor-General of Victoria. Prior to this, St Vincent's Place, as it is known now, was used as a race track for horses for a period of 9 months or so. The current layout is the work of Clement designers, the noted surveyor, engineer and topographer, who adapted the design in 1857 to allow for its intersection by the St Kilda railway. The precinct, which in its original configuration extended from Park Street in the north to Bridport Street in the south, and from Howe Crescent in the east to Nelson Road and Cardigan Street in the west, was designed to emulate similar 'square' developments in London, although on a grander scale. The main streets were named after British naval heroes. The development of the special character of St Vincent Place has been characterised, since the first land sales in the 1860s, by a variety of housing stock which has included quality row and detached houses dominated by Rochester Terrace (Heritage Register Number 813), and by the gardens which, although they have been continuously developed, remain faithful to the initial landscape concept"."
Historical significance.
It is registered with the National Trust of Australia and on the Victorian Heritage Register for its "aesthetic, historical, architectural and social significance to the State of Victoria".
The Victorian Heritage Register states St Vincent Place is ""aesthetically important for the outstanding quality of its urban landscape. The major elements that reflect this importance are the gardens with their gardenesque style layout and fine collections of mature specimen trees, and the harmonious relationship of the gardens with the residential buildings facing them around St Vincent Place. The St Vincent Place Precinct is historically important as the premier 'square' development in Victoria based on similar models in London. It is significant as the largest development of its type in Victoria and for its unusual development as gardens rather than the more usual small park as at, for example Macarthur, Murchison, Lincoln and Argyle Squares in Carlton. The precinct is also historically significant for its associations with Surveyor General Andrew Clarke, and more particularly with Clement Hodgkinson, a prolific and influential surveyor engineer in early Melbourne. The St Vincent Place Precinct is architecturally important for the consistent quality of its built form and its high degree of intactness from its earliest phase of development, characterised by a mixture of one and two storey terraces and detached houses. The St Vincent Place Precinct is socially important as a reflection of the aspirations of middle class residents in South Melbourne. Because of the shared outlook on and use of the gardens, the precinct has developed a sense of community cohesion unusual in the Melbourne context. The gardens are also socially important as a focus of community life for the surrounding district with the maintenance of their amenity a priority of municipal government since their inception. The existence of the tennis and bowls club s in the gardens for over a century is a further manifestation of this social importance"."
The Australian Demographer Bernard Salt included the precinct as first among his "favourite places that have been designed by planners" : "St Vincent Place, Albert Park: Where would such a list start but in my home city of Melbourne? Surely this residential precinct known only to Melburnians must be one of this nation's town planning treasures. Here are two extended but connecting crescents laid out around gardens which are overlooked by double-storey Victorian terrace houses. Designed in the early 1850s, St Vincent Place was virtually a gated community: the well-to-do would promenade around "their public gardens; smaller wooden houses for servants and the working classes were relegated to the lesser enveloping crescents."
People &amp; literature.
Marshall Browne's book 'The Gilded Cage' covers an eighteen-month period in 1888–89 and tells the ill-starred love story of William Boyd and Helen O'Neill, and a happier-ending one between Boyd and Katherine Lindsay with a backdrop of "graceful St Vincent Place".
A resident Mary Josephine O'Brien inherited Port Melbourne's Victoria Hotel and O'Brien's Terrace in 1901.
World War I brought grief to several households in St Vincent Place.
In 1928 the first Australian Novitiate of the Catholic Carmelite Order was established in St Vincent Place.
"Albert William Andrews was found in a boarding house in St Vincent's Place, Albert Park in the early 1950s. The place was sold up or his health was deteriorating and the family was contacted."
A 1969 battle to preserve the area from major road construction is described in an interview with Barbara Niven by the Cultural Heritage Centre for Asia and the Pacific 
The battle was in 1972, not 1969. It was launched with a pamphlet showing a map of the alternative routes for the proposed F14 Freeway. Pamphlet Authorized by Reg Macey 68 McGregor Street, Middle Park
In 2006, 2 residents received Australian Honours. Ms Imogen Laurie received an honour ""For service to people with disabilities as an advocate for improved disability policies and services through community and public sector organisations"." Mr Terrence O'Shannassy received an honour ""For service to the community, particularly to youth, and to technical education for people seeking employment opportunities"."

Neutral Party

The Neutral Party (, NP) was a Dutch political party founded in 1918 representing artists' interests. It played only a marginal role in Dutch politics.
History.
The NP was founded on 14 February 1918 by , a well-known revue artist. The 1918 elections were the first in the Netherlands to use a system of proportional representation. With about 7,000 votes (0,5% of the votes) the NP won one seat, as did several other ones or two-person parties. After the elections, the election law became more restrictive. After the elections the NP initiated the formation of a neutral parliamentary group, which united several ones and two-person parties, namely the Neutral Party, Peasants' League, the Economic League, the Middle Class Party and the Alliance to Democratise the Forces. The parliamentary party was led by the former minister Willem Treub. In 1921 several of these parties, including the Neutral Party merged into the Liberal State Party ("the Freedom League"), together with two larger liberal parties. Until 1929 the party was an independent part in the Liberal State Party, campaigning with its own list.
Ideology and issues.
The NP was a typical special-interest party. Its main goal was to represent the interests of artists and people employed in the entertainment sector. In all other questions it sought to supersede partisan interest and act from the general interest.
Leadership and support.
This table shows the NP's results in elections to the House of Representatives and Senate, as well as the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter, is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lijsttrekker is the party's top candidate in the general election, these posts are normally taken by the party's leader.
Electorate.
The party drew most of its support from voters who were not aligned with any of the major pillars.

Burn Rubber (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)

"Burn Rubber (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)" is a song originally performed by the Gap Band in 1980 and written by member Charlie Wilson, Rudy Taylor, and producer Lonnie Simmons.
Background.
According to engineer Jack Rouben, the foundation of the song started with its bassline: "[The track] was a musical idea that Charlie came up with on the Minimoog that turned into a groove, then a completed arrangement, and then they put the lyrics at the very end...This song was built upon that one repeating bass track, and that was the jam that blossomed into a whole complete song." Rouben also remarked how the title for this song, along with many other hits by the band, was a phrase coined by co-writer Rudy Taylor.
Chart performance.
In 1981, it peaked at number 84 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, number 90 on Cash Box and number 1 on the R&amp;B charts. "Billboard" magazine ranked it as the 12th biggest R&amp;B single of 1981. A later single released, featuring "Humpin'" on the B-side, scored a number 19 appearance on the dance charts.
Inspiration.
On June 30, 2021, Dave Grohl said that the drumming on "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was ripped off from the drum intro of "Burn Rubber on Me".

Keren Hayesod

Keren Hayesod – United Israel Appeal (, literally "The Foundation Fund") is an official fundraising organization for Israel with branches in 45 countries. Its work is carried out in accordance with the Keren haYesod Law-5716, passed by the Knesset in January 1956, granting the organization a unique fundraising status. It is a registered corporation of the State of Israel.
One of Israel's three "National Institutions," Keren Hayesod works in coordination with the Government of Israel and the Jewish Agency for Israel to further the national priorities of the State of Israel.
History.
Pre-state era.
Keren Hayesod was established at the World Zionist Congress in London on July 7–24, 1920 to provide the Zionist movement with resources needed to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. It came in response to the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which stated that "His Majesty's government views with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people" – turning the ages-old dream of the return to the Land of Israel into a politically feasible goal.
Keren Hayesod established fundraising organizations around the world. Early leaders included Chaim Weizmann, Albert Einstein and Ze'ev Jabotinsky.
During the 1920s, Keren Hayesod began to lay the groundwork for a Jewish national home and helped raise funds to establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Bank Hapoalim and various physical projects. In 1926, Keren Hayesod relocated its headquarters from London to Jerusalem. With the establishment of the Jewish Agency in 1929, Keren Hayesod became its fundraising arm while continuing its own wide-ranging activities.
The effects of the worldwide economic depression of 1929 hit Keren Hayesod hard, but after Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Keren Hayesod helped to develop the Haifa Bay suburbs to provide housing for German Jews fleeing the Nazis. Towards this end, the Rassco construction company was established in 1934. In 1936, Keren Hayesod supported the establishment of what would become the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra to provide employment for refugee musicians.
With the help of donations from all over the Jewish world, Keren Hayesod established over 900 urban and rural settlements in Israel, provided housing and jobs for new immigrants. During and after World War II, it launched emergency campaigns, sometimes in partnership with other organizations. Funds were used to help the Allied war effort and when the concentration camps were liberated to smuggle survivors into Palestine in defiance of British immigration restrictions.
Many Keren Hayesod leaders were murdered in the Holocaust. In March 1948, a car bomb was detonated in the courtyard of the building, killing twelve people, including the director of Keren Hayesod, Leib Yaffe.
State of Israel.
The first full decade that followed the birth of the State of Israel was marked by huge waves of immigration, primarily from North Africa, Yemen, Kurdistan and Iraq. Within a few years, Israel's population tripled, resulting in great distress and a heightened demand for social, educational and cultural services. Keren Hayesod Sderot (1951) and Eilat (1956), as well as kibbutzim and moshavim. Keren Hayesod provided major funding for these communities, establishing new fundraising campaigns around the world and renewing its presence in Germany (1955).
The economic crisis that hit Israel in 1983 and 1984 created major hardships, and programs to alleviate social distress became Keren Hayesod's major priority. Keren Hayesod-supported Operation Moses brought 5,000 new immigrants from Ethiopia to Israel in a dramatic airlift (1984), and the organization immediately mobilized to raise funds to address the new immigrants’ special needs.
Israel was still in the throes of the First Intifada (1987–1993) when the Soviet Union imploded. The end of the Communist regime in the USSR (1991) opened the gates to over a million Jews who had been fighting for years for the right to immigrate to their ancestral homeland. In addition, over 14,000 Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to Israel in Operation Solomon (in 1991).
The massive numbers of new immigrants created a huge demand for immigrant services, housing, and jobs; Keren Hayesod launched a special Exodus Campaign to fund this effort.
Renewed resistance to Israel’s illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories, marked by the Second Intifada (2000-2004), had a devastating impact on the Israeli economy, resulting in major social distress. The situation was exacerbated by the crisis in the tourism industry and the bursting of the hi-tech bubble. In response, Keren Hayesod traditional areas of activity, immigrant absorption and Jewish-Zionist education in the Diaspora. Thus, for example, Keren Hayesod, in partnership with the Jewish Agency, Cisco Systems Inc. and the Appleseeds Academy, initiated the Net@ project, which provides high-tech training to youth in the suburbs. Keren Hayesod was also a lead partner in the Jewish Agency Fund for Victims of Terror.
Tens of thousands disadvantaged children and adults are served by social and cultural programs established by Keren Hayesod. The organization also provides financial support to educational youth villages, after-school programming, and youth mentoring projects. Sheltered housing has been constructed to enable Holocaust survivors and the needy elderly live out their lives in dignity and comfort.
Keren Hayesod marked its 90th anniversary in 2010. A major priority is now financial aid to peripheral cities in Israel and programs to bridge the social gap.
Emergency campaigns.
Keren haYesod provided assistance to residents of southern Israel under daily rocket attack in the summer of 2014. Following the kidnapping and murder of three teenage boys by Hamas in early June, rocket fire from Gaza intensified into round-the-clock attacks with only 15 seconds to run for safety. Keren Hayesod financed the construction of portable bomb shelters in residential areas. These shelters were purchased with funds collected in Keren Hayesod's Emergency Solidarity Campaign launched after Operation “Protective Edge.” Funds were also used to provide fun days for children, giving them a break from the rocket fire, and for professional counseling for traumatized residents. Medical equipment was acquired for hospitals in the south where injured soldiers and civilians were brought for treatment. Other support included financial assistance to families of fallen soldiers and civilians killed in terror attacks, as well as injured soldiers and families whose homes were destroyed by rockets.

Kongulu Mobutu

Ndolo Michel Mathieu Kongulu Mobutu (21 April 1970 – 24 September 1998), often shortened to Kongolo Mobutu and also known by his nickname Saddam Hussein, was a son of Mobutu Sese Seko, the president of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), and an officer in the Special Presidential Division (DSP).
Biography.
Early life.
Kongulu (also known as Kongolo) was one of the twenty-one children of President Mobutu Sese Seko. His mother was the President's first wife Marie-Antoinette Gbiatibwa Gogbe Yetene, who died in 1977. He was described as "a stocky, bearded man with a taste for fast cars, gambling and women."
Despotic activity.
Kongulu Mobutu was a Captain in the DSP. When he left The School for Officers Training (EFO) in Kananga, he started his career as Second Lieutenant in The Military Service for Action and Intelligence (SARM). As Captain, he was Personal Secretary of General Bolozi in SARM. He was General Bolozi's protegee. Bolozi is married to Kongulu's aunt. Kongulu was a key enforcer in the final years of his father's regime. 
In his childhood at Camp Tshatshi, Kongulu was nicknamed "Gang". Very tenacious at times, like his father, his straight character has earned him several nicknames, including that of "Vatican", as to say that he his a state within a state. His intimates friends also nicknamed him "Dubai"or "tempelo". Out of all president Mobutu's sons, Kongulu was the most feared . His infamous nickname "Saddam Hussein" (Iraqi president dictator at the time) was not earned because of false allegations about brutality treatments against people in Zaire. He earned his nickname in the early 90s when he was a lieutenant and , with soldiers of his unit of the Division spéciale présidentielle under his command (DSP, unité Dragons) , came to save Zairean citizens who had an altercation with American G.Is in Kinshasa by circling them. He finally obtained the release of the zairean citizens and was since nicknamed "Saddam" in reference to Iraqi dictator who was at the time defying the USA during the Gulf War 1 ( Operation "Desert Storm") , to mark in the collective imagination that he defied the Americans.
Business activity.
Kongulu Mobutu was in charge of various businesses in Zaire, including shipping and import firms, entertainment Yoshad Productions. He exercised a strong influence onto the popular musical band Wenge Musica BCBG of Werrason, Jb Mpiana, Didier Masela. He reconciled Koffi Olomide and Jossart Nyoka Nlongo after a feud. According to a former employee, quoted in a United Nations report, one of his companies, Hyochade, acted as a front for extortion, state propaganda and surveillance of political opponents. The German ZDF network's investigative program "Kennzeichen D" has claimed that Kongulu participated in the siphoning off of the national wealth by helping to organize the secret movement of gold to Gambia during the 1990s.
Flight from revolution.
In April 1997, as forces led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila advanced towards Zaire's capital, Kinshasa, it is alleged that Kongulu Mobutu compiled a list of 500 of his father's opponents who were to be assassinated. When troops entered the city on May 17, Defense Minister, General Donatien Mahele Lieko Bokungu tried to negotiate and was shot dead; it has been claimed that Kongulu had a role in his killing at Camp Tshashi. Kongulu will be later clear of these accusations.
It is revealed that Kongulu was the one who came to cover General Mahele's body. He came after the action and senior Commanders of the DSP were present during assassination. Kongulu had no influence on DSP soldiers. He was the last most famous person of Mobutu's regime to leave Kinshasa on 17 May 1997, after he tried unsuccessfully to defend his father's rule (he commanded his father's bodyguards to the frontline). Kongulu fled across the border to Brazzaville later that day while rebels were almost 10 km away from the beach. His house was ransacked by soldiers and civilians.
Family.
Kongulu was married to Dany Kanyeba Nyembwe and had children together. They lived in Kinshasa.
Death.
Kongulu Mobutu died in exile in Monaco on 24 September 1998, aged 28 (a year after he attended his father's funeral at Rabat, Morocco). It is unclear if he died at the Princess Grace of Monaco Hospital or at his father’s villa del Mare of Roquebrune Cap Martin. His death remains mysterious, despite various testimonies saying he died of HIV causes, illness or wound infection. Former Reuters journalist Michela Wrong has written that he and his brother Nyiwa died of AIDS.

Vent (submarine)

In submarine technology, a ballast tank vent is a valve fitted to the top of a submarine's ballast tanks to let air escape from the top of the ballast tank and be replaced by water entering through the opening(s) called "flood ports" or "floods" at the bottom of the tank. The vent is controlled by operating gear.
History.
In earlier times on US Submarines, the openings at the bottom of the ballast tank were fitted with valves known as Kingston valves. These valves were eliminated in the U.S. Navy between the World Wars.
Operation.
When on the surface, a submarine's ballast tanks are filled with air, which gives the vessel its buoyancy. In order for the submarine to submerge, water is taken into the ballast tanks through the flood ports at the bottom of the tanks, effacing this excess buoyancy. As the ballast tanks contain air when on the surface, it is necessary to allow this air to escape, so that water may then enter the tanks, and this air is allowed to escape via the opened vents in the top of the ballast tanks.
The vents which are used to allow water to enter the submarine's main ballast tanks when it submerges are the main vents and it is air escaping through these that accounts for the spray sometimes seen when submarines dive.
To get a submarine to surface, the main vents in the top of the tank are closed, and high-pressure compressed air is blown into the ballast tanks, forcing the water out through the flood ports at the bottom of the tank. Replacing ballast water with lighter air reduces the vessel's total mass. When the weight of the vessel becomes less than the weight of the volume of displaced water, buoyancy becomes positive in accordance with Archimedes' principle, and the submarine begins to rise. The displacement of a submerged submarine with full ballast tanks is greater than the displacement on the surface with empty ballast tanks where buoyancy equilibrium is restored. 
Once on the surface, in order to conserve supplies of compressed air, a lower-pressure compressor is then used to remove the remainder of the water from the tanks.

Widescreen display modes

Widescreen televisions provide several modes for displaying video from 4:3 (standard aspect ratio) sources. These modes may be selected manually from a remote control, or automatically if an Active Format Description is available.
Normal mode.
"Normal mode" frames the 4:3 video to the 16:9 picture area by displaying it in its original aspect ratio, with vertical gray or black bars on both sides of the screen. The disadvantage of this method is the fact that the image is small by virtue of not using the entire width of the screen. This is also known as the "4:3 mode".
Full mode.
"Full mode" horizontally stretches the 4:3 video evenly across the entire width of the screen. This is the proper mode to display anamorphic video. If used for standard aspect ratio video, everything on the screen will appear wider than normal. Contrast this with anamorphic video displayed without processing on a 4:3 display, in which people on the screen will appear taller than normal. This is also known as the "16:9 mode".
Zoom mode.
"Zoom mode" evenly stretches the picture both horizontally and vertically, until the picture fills the entire width of the screen. This crops out the top and bottom of the picture. This mode is used for letterboxed and open matte video.
14:9 mode.
In "14:9 mode", the picture is magnified more than in Normal mode, but less than in Zoom mode, while retaining the original aspect ratio.
Wide Zoom mode.
"Wide Zoom mode", also called "Just mode", "Horizon", or "Smart Stretch", progressively stretches the picture horizontally, less in the middle and more on the edges. This allows normal aspect ratio video to be displayed across the entire width of the screen, with minimal cropping, and with much less of the unpleasing visual stretching effect of "Full mode".

Eddie Piller

Eddie Piller is a British DJ, radio show host, and founder/managing director of Acid Jazz Records.
Early life and career.
Piller was born in 1963 and grew up in Essex. His father ran a firm of bookmakers and his mother ran the Small Faces' fan club during their early years. As a teenager in the 1970s, Piller became interested in the punk scene, and was a fan of the Buzzcocks before following the mod-revival of the late '70s and early '80s. He credits bands such as the Chords, the Jam and Secret Affair for sparking his love of all things mod, indirectly beginning his career in music.
During the early '80s, Piller began DJing at mod club nights with great success and decided to set up his first record label aged just 21, releasing a single by R&amp;B band Fast Eddie, whilst a couple of years prior, in late 1979, he had already launched the popular mod revival fanzine "Extraordinary Sensations", along with Terry Rawlings. He ran a second-hand record market stall, Marvel's Records, at Kensington Market in the early '80s. He appeared in the Style Council's "A Solid Bond in Your Heart" video in 1983. By 1985, Piller was scouted by Stiff Records as a label manager and A&amp;R man for the Countdown Records label, where he gave fresh momentum to the underground mod scene by signing bands such as the Prisoners and Makin' Time, and by issuing the mod revival compilation album "5-4-3-2-1 Go!". As well as working for Stiff, he set up another label named Re-Elect The President which launched the careers of the James Taylor Quartet and the Jazz Renegades (a band featuring Style Council drummer Steve White).
Acid Jazz Records.
In 1987, along with fellow DJ Gilles Peterson, he started a new record label, Acid Jazz Records. This soon gave rise to Britain's newest musical movement, the acid jazz scene, which included bands such as the James Taylor Quartet, Corduroy, Brand New Heavies, Mother Earth, Galliano and Jamiroquai, most of whom Piller signed in 1992 after Peterson's departure from the label. As well as managing the bands, Piller produced some of the records, most notably Mother Earth's album "The People Tree".
Currently, actor Matt Berry is signed to Acid Jazz Records and has released four albums on the label. Piller featured in the music video for Berry's 2013 single "Medicine", as well as in two episodes of his popular television show "Toast of London".
The Blue-Note.
In the mid-nineties Piller purchased a derelict jazz club which he turned into a nightclub named the Blue Note. Whilst initially used as a way of promoting the record label's music, the club soon built up a large reputation and was open seven nights a week hosting various different club nights including that of musician Goldie's Metaheadz label. The club closed when Hackney Council took the license away.
Radio hosting.
Piller has also had a number of radio shows throughout the years on stations such as Jazz FM, BBC Radio 2, and Q Radio. Between 2014 and 2018, Eddie hosted "Eddie Piller's Eclectic Soul Show", broadcast Thursday afternoons on the Internet station Soho Radio.
Piller continues to be influential in the music scene due to his many live DJing appearances. He is a regular at most British festivals and usually appears at the Isle of Wight, Glastonbury, and Bestival, as well as hosting a regular soul-themed club night "Soul Box" at Old Street Records.
In late 2010, Piller began to host a regular podcast called "The Modcast". The monthly podcast was co-hosted with Acid Jazz Records A&amp;R man Dean Rudland, and features discussions about "all things mod and beyond" including the influence of mod subculture on fashion, television and sport with guests such as musicians Steve Cradock, P.P. Arnold and Rhoda Dakar, the actor Martin Freeman and Olympic medal-winning cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins.
Journalistic career.
Throughout his career, Piller has served as a consultant writer for documentaries on youth culture, mod subculture, soul music, and the film "The Who, the Mods and the Quadrophenia Connection".
In 2018, Piller was co-writer of "Mod Zines", a book on mod fanzines of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
In 2023, Piller curated a touring exhibition dedicated to Acid Jazz and published a memoir of his early life entitled "Clean living under difficult circumstances".

Mozambique national cricket team

The Mozambique national cricket team is the men's team that represents Mozambique in international cricket. The team is administered by the Mozambican Cricket Association which became an affiliate member of International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2003, and an associate member in 2017. Mozambique is also a member of the Africa Cricket Association. The Mozambique national cricket team has competed in the World Cricket League Africa Region, Cricket World Cup and the ICC Africa Twenty20 Championship.
History.
Mozambique became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council in 2003 and then an associate member in 2017 when the affiliate status was scrapped.
50 over cricket.
2003.
Their international debut came the following year, when they played in the African Affiliates championship which was the first stage of qualifying for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. They would finish in 6th place after defeating only Rwanda.
2006.
Mozambique, as a member of the African Cricket Association, competes in the World Cricket League Africa Region which is a 50 over competition for African countries that aren't full member of the ICC. For this edition, they competed in the third division as they drawn to meet Sierra Leone, Morocco and Rwanda. In the opening match against Sierra Leone, they scored a six wicket win after they bowled out the opposition for only 197. In return, Kaleem Shah top scored with 55 to give the team their first up victory. Kaleem Shah scored the first century of the tournament in the next game against Morocco to get the team to 275 from 50 overs. Morocco in return could only muster up a score of 196 with Shah being the best bowler. The final group game saw Mozambique win the match against Rwanda by 112 runs to finish on top of pool 2. In the semi-final stage, they took on Ghana and Zainul Patel dominated the bowling with 4 wickets to help in getting the team through to the final. In the final game of the tournament, top scorer Kaleem Shah top scored in the final with him scoring 77 in the 89 run victory to move Mozambique to the next division.
Division Two was held in Tanzania with five teams competing for a spot in Division 1. For Mozambique, they had to compete against Botswana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia.
2018-Present.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Mozambique and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have been full T20I matches.
Mozambique played their first T20I on 6 November 2019, against Malawi, during the 2019 T20 Kwacha Cup; they lost by three wickets with two balls left.

Krekenava

Krekenava is a town (population 1,375) in Panevėžys district municipality in northern Lithuania, on the bank of Nevėžis.
Etymology.
In the past, the town's place name had a different root than it does now: "krakin-" or "krokin-". In the old days, the town was mostly called Krakinava, a name still used in the early 20th century. The new form "Krekenava" was referred to by Vaižgantas as early as 1904, and it was included in the official publication "Places Settled in Lithuania" of 1925. The town's name in other languages: ; .
History.
From 1409 it was the center of Upytė poviat, the first wooden church built by Vytautas the Great in 1419. Nearby Krekanava is the birthplace of the painter (1845–1915).
In July and August 1941, an Einsatzgruppen of Lithuanian nationalists massacred the Jewish residents of the town, about 50 grownups and 60 children. Along with Jews they also shot so-called Communists and Soviet activists, in all about 190 people. The massacre took place in a ditch between the old and new cemeteries.
Economy.
1975 is a year of the beginning of JSC “Krekenavos Agrofirma” activities, a company which employs over 900 people. “Krekenavos agrofirma” allocates its investments to the two priority fields – improvement of the quality of its activities, and production expansion.

Song control system

A song system, also known as a song control system (SCS), is a series of discrete brain nuclei involved in song production and vocal learning in songbirds. It was first observed by Fernando Nottebohm in 1976 in a paper titled "Central control of song in the canary, "Serinus canarius"", published in the "Journal of Comparative Neurology". 
Operation.
Based on lesion studies in the zebra finch, the song system can be broken into two general pathways. The direct/descending motor pathway is both necessary and sufficient for normal song production, while the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) is necessary for song learning but not production. Juvenile birds who have not yet fully learned their songs and that have lesions of the AFP never learn to make normal songs. Adult birds who experience these same lesions continue to sing normally for some time. The song system is sexually dimorphic in many species of songbirds, especially in species in which the male primarily sings.
System model.
The song system has emerged as leading model of adult neural plasticity. The song system is the first neural circuit in which it was conclusively demonstrated that newly generated neurons are incorporated into the brains of adults vertebrates. Some seasonally-breeding songbird brains vary in volume, neuron number, and density depending on the time of year, and these changes in the brain are driven by changes in circulating levels of testosterone.

<doc id="6966261" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6966261" title="Haptanthus">
Haptanthus

Haptanthus is a monotypic genus containing the sole species Haptanthus hazlettii, a shrub or small tree known only from the locality of Matarras in the Arizona Municipality in Honduras. Its flowers are unique among the flowering plants. A single "female" (carpellate) flower has two branches on either side which carry "male" (staminate) flowers. The flowers are very simple, lacking obvious sepals or petals. The family placement of the genus has been uncertain but based on molecular phylogenetic research, it is included in the family Buxaceae . Very few individuals have ever been found, and its habitat is threatened by logging.
Description.
"Haptanthus hazlettii" is a shrub or tree. It has opposite leaves spaced at apart, usually arranged in two ranks (distichous). The leaves are simple with untoothed (entire) margins. There are no stipules. The leaf stalk (petiole) is short, long, the leaf blade (lamina) long by wide. The entire plant is hairless (glabrous).
The flowers are unisexual, carried on the same inflorescence (i.e. the plant is monoecious). One (or occasionally two) inflorescences emerge from a leaf axil, with at least five inflorescence-bearing axils per fertile branch. The inflorescences have a unique structure among flowering plants. In the centre there is a single carpellate ("female") flower. This lacks obvious petals or sepals (although there are small bracts below the flower which some researchers have suggested may be the remnants of the perianth), and consists solely of a single-celled (unilocular) ovary, long by wide, surmounted by three curved long stigmas. On either side of the solitary carpellate flower there are two branches each with five or six staminate ("male") flowers arranged at intervals.
The structure of the staminate flowers has been interpreted differently. The original describers of the species, Aaron Goldberg and Cirilo Nelson, considered that each staminate flower was basically just a single stamen, with a flattened filament about long grading into an anther about long. Two staminate flowers from the original specimen were re-examined by Andrew Doust and Peter Stevens. They concluded that each staminate flower definitely had two anthers, closely pressed together. They were unable to make a firm choice between two interpretations. The first is that the staminate flowers are basically as described by Goldberg and Nelson, except there are two stamens with fused or closely pressed filaments and anthers rather than one. The second, which they preferred, is that Goldberg and Nelson's "filament" is actually a pedicel (i.e. a stem on which the parts of the flower are carried) and that their "anther" consists of two closely pressed structures each made up of a tepal with a fused anther inside it. Either way, the flowers of "Haptanthus hazlettii" have "a morphology unlike that of any other angiosperm".
Taxonomy.
The sole species was first discovered in 1980 when a single specimen was collected by Donald L. Hazlett. It was described scientifically in 1989 by Goldberg and Nelson, as a new genus and species, "Haptanthus hazlettii". Initially Goldberg and Nelson were unable to assign "Haptanthus" to a family. Nelson later placed it in its own family, Haptanthaceae. In 2005, an attempt was made to obtain DNA for sequencing from the only known specimen, but this failed. Based on an analysis of the morphology of the specimen, Doust and Stevens suggested that "Haptanthus" was possibly related to the Buxales. The APG III system of 2009 accepted the family Haptanthaceae, placing it in the order Buxales, along with the Buxaceae. The close relationship with the Buxaceae was confirmed in 2011 when DNA was successfully obtained from a newly collected specimen. Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that "Haptanthus" belongs inside the family Buxaceae rather than in a family of its own. The APG IV system of 2016 includes "Haptanthus" in the family Buxaceae.
Distribution, habitat and conservation.
"Haptanthus hazlettii" has only been found in a very small area of tropical rain forest on the northern coast of Honduras, close to Matarras in the Arizona Municipality. After the original specimen was collected in 1989, numerous attempts were made to find the species again but without success; the area had become covered with grass following tree clearance. It was thought that the species was perhaps extinct. In 2010 an expedition organized by Alexey B. Shipunov and Ekaterina Shipunova found a single tree from the original collection point. A few more were later found nearby. Work to conserve the species is being led by the Lancetilla Botanical Garden of Tela, Honduras.

I Just Can't Wait to Be King

"I Just Can't Wait to Be King" is a 1994 song written by Elton John (music) and Tim Rice (lyrics) for the Disney animated feature film "The Lion King" (1994). The song was performed in 1992 by American actor and singer Jason Weaver as the singing voice of young Simba, with English actor Rowan Atkinson and American actress Laura Williams providing supporting vocals in their roles as Zazu and the singing voice of young Nala, respectively. It was released June 12, 1994 on The Lion King: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.
The song was featured in the 2019 film adaptation, performed by JD McCrary, John Oliver, and Shahadi Wright Joseph released June 11, 2019 on The Lion King: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.
Elton John single.
Elton John performed the second version of I Just Can't Wait to Be King as a single.
Analysis.
The song is "an ode to youthful arrogance, invincibility, and above all, impatience".
Critical reception.
"The New York Times Film Reviews 1993–1994" deemed the song to be derivative as well as "cute, lilting [and] safe", and likened the song to Michael Jackson singing "Under the Sea". "The Cavalier Daily" also compared the song to those from "The Little Mermaid", and "Popdust" compared it to Billy Joel's "River of Dreams".
"The New York Times Theater Reviews 1997–1998" felt that the song was "conventionally comic and upbeat". "Lakeland Ledger" wrote that it is a "dazzling Busby Berkeley-style dancefest" with a "Rockettes kickline". It has been described as "strutting", "bouncy", "grand", and a "hubris-filled fantasy song". "News.com" deemed it the underdog song of "The Lion King", adding "this showstopper about the future didn't get the accolades its brethren received."
Less favorable reviews have described the song as "irritating" and not very "thematically rich". "Popdust" ranked the song 5 out of 6 songs in the film, and "BoingBoing" listed it as the 11th best "I Want" song in the Disney repertoire. "The Cavalier Daily" deemed the Elton John reworking "uneventful and boring".
Context.
In film.
"I Just Can't Wait to Be King" is a large contrast from the film's non-musical segments; the onset of the song sees a change from a neutral color palette. The song is performed near the beginning of the film by a young Simba and Nala as to enunciate Simba's desires to become King. It is a prelude to Simba's lost innocence, being tricked into thinking he killed his father, his leaving Pride Rock, and attempt to forget his past.
Direct-to-video prequel.
It also appears in DisneyToon's 2004 direct-to-video followup "The Lion King 1½". Timon and Pumbaa are disturbed by some noise from outside of their home, which is actually Simba, Nala, and the animals singing this musical number. Timon is angry and hits the leg of an elephant supporting the tower of animals with a stick. The elephant jumps in surprise and causes the tower to collapse, explaining why it collapses in the original film. Timon and Pumbaa's home is ruined by this event.
In musical.
The song appears in the Broadway show and is performed by Scott Irby-Ranniar, Kajuana Shuford, and Geoff Hoyle on the 1997 Original Cast Recording. In the Spanish language version of The Lion King, "I Just Can't Wait to be King" was performed by Mexican singer and entertainer Kalimba. Elton John himself also recorded his own version of the song for the film's soundtrack.

D2 motorway (Slovakia)

D2 is a motorway () in Slovakia. It connects the Czech border at Kúty with the Hungarian border at Čunovo, passing through (ordered north to south) Malacky, Bratislava and Jarovce. 
It is part of the European routes E65 and E75 and of the Pan-European Corridor IV. The construction of the highway started in 1969 and concluded in 2007. It is the only complete highway in Slovakia.
History.
The first plans on D2 motorway/freeway appeared in the 1960s, from the Czechoslovak government act in 1963 to build the 117 km long motorway from Brno to Bratislava, with 58.4 km in today's Slovakia. The construction started in April 1969, with the first section from Bratislava to Malacky, which was open in November 1973. 
In 1974, construction also started on the Czech side from Brno, with the two ends of the motorways joining on 8 November 1980, a day, when also the D1 motorway in the Czech part of Czechoslovakia was completed, joining the three most important cities in the country (Prague, Brno and Bratislava). A new planned segment from Bratislava to the Hungarian border was added in 1987. Construction continued with the building of the Lafranconi Bridge in Bratislava and the junction with D1 motorway junction and temporary end in Petržalka in the years 1985 - 1991 and after its opening, construction stopped for five years.
Construction resumed only in 1996, with the sections from the temporary end to Hungary and Austria, with all being opened in 1998 and with the 8.5 km segment from D4 junction to the Hungarian border being widened in 2002. Today, the motorway is complete, with the last 3 km in Bratislava opened on 24 June 2007. This section contained the only tunnel, the Sitina Tunnel, in its entire length.
As of 2012, part of the D2 highway is still not officially finished as it was put into temporary use 12 years ago and the paperwork to legalize the section of the highway near Jarovce is unobtainable due to excessive noise levels. 
Future developments.
There are plans to widen the motorway to a six lane motorway with 3 lanes going one way and this is to be done by 2033.

Mitzpe Kramim

Mitzpe Kramim (, lit. "Vineyards Lookout") is an Israeli outpost in the West Bank. Located on a mountain ridge overlooking the Jordan Valley, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council.
It is built, as ruled by the Israeli Supreme Court on 25 August 2020, on private lands owned by residents of the Palestinian village of Deir Jarir. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli and United States governments dispute this.
Demographics.
According to the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, 42 families live in Mitzpe Kramim as of July 2022.
History.
Mitzpe Keramim was established in 1999 on the Israeli Independence Day near the Israeli settlement of Kokhav HaShahar. Several second-generation families from Kokhav HaShahar moved to a hill south of the village. 
Less than a year later, after an agreement with the Ehud Barak government, the group was relocated to a hilltop closer to Kokhav HaShahar. However, only a few months later, a new village, Ma'ale Shlomo, was established on the original site.
Land dispute.
In 2011, a group of Palestinians from the village of Deir Jarir claiming ownership over the land on which the outpost sits, submitted a petition to the High Court of Justice to have the community of some 40 families removed. A Jerusalem District Court judge ruled in 2018 that the settlement doesn't need to be razed because it was built "in good faith" and the residents have rights to the property. 
The decision was based on a policy known as "market regulation" that is used in Israeli Law whenever authorities grant building rights to unowned land and only after the building is up and residents live there, a claim is made on the land that was not known at the time of authorization. A Supreme Court ruling from August 2020 overturned this decision but in July 2022 reversed its own decision and accepted the state's argument.
According to the Palestinian Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem (ARIJ), Israeli settlers "forcefully seized" land from the Palestinian villages of Deir Jarir and Kafr Malik in order to build Mitzpe Kramim.

Tampere University

Tampere University (, shortened TAU) is a multidisclipinary public university located in the city of Tampere, Finland. It is the second largest university in the country by student enrollment.
The university was established on January 1, 2019, as a merger between the former University of Tampere and Tampere University of Technology. The new university is also the major shareholder of Tampere University of Applied Sciences.
History.
The University of Tampere was founded in 1925 as the Civic College in Helsinki teaching public administration, organisation management and journalism. In 1930, a total of 195 students were enrolled at the College and its name was amended to the School of Social Sciences. As the institution grew, it expanded to municipal administration, public law, child protection, and civic education. Faculty of Social Sciences was established in 1949 as the first faculty. By 1960, the number of students had increased to 933 and the School of Social Sciences moved to Tampere. The institution was renamed to the University of Tampere in 1966.
Tampere had been the most important industrial center in Finland since the late 19th century. Agathon Meurman, member of the senate of Finland, had expressed the need for a technical higher institution already in the mid-19th century. Yet, even after the continuation war all technical higher education was conducted in Helsinki University of Technology. Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland, signed an edict for establishing a Tampere-based branch of the Helsinki University of Technology in 1965. The school began operating on the same year. The branch gained independent university status in 1972 and was named as Tampere University of Technology.
The two universities always had close relations and co-operation was common in the fields of economics, computer science, biotechnology, and medical technology. Therefore, merging the universities had been suggested multiple times. The Tampere3 merger process began in 2014 when vuorineuvos Stig Gustavson invited the higher education institutions in Tampere to discuss a reform. In 2015, the three universities decided the objectives on creating the new university in Tampere. In 2016, the Ministry of Education and Culture appointed a steering, and a working group to prepare the establishment of a new foundation university. Initially, Tampere University of Applied Sciences was planned to merge into the new foundation, similarly to the other two universities. However, this would have required changes to legislation since Universities of Applied Sciences, or polytechnics, are not considered as Universities, in Finland, which can grant licentiate and doctorate degrees. The merger of the two universities was approved by the Finnish Parliament in December 2017 and came into effect on 1 January 2019. The university commune ("TUNI") comprises the new Tampere University and the Tampere University of Applied Sciences, of which Tampere University is the major shareholder. 
In 2021 it was announced that Tampere University is trying to get rid of a large part of its premises. The goal is to reduce farms by 25% by 2030. This includes closing the University Library. The announcement was met with protest from faculty staff and students as they felt that there is a lack of transparency in the design of this decision, and that their voices were not heard in the matter.
Organisation.
Faculties.
Tampere University comprises the following faculties:
Academics.
Studies.
A total of 21,500 degree students studied at the Tampere University in 2021, including 18,800 students in bachelor's and master's degree programmes, and 2,700 students in doctoral degree programmes. Additionally 1,600 students are completing medical specialty training. In 2019, the university received 28,265 applications of whom 2,977 were enrolled for an admission rate of 11%. During that same year, the university was the second most applied university in Finland only bested by the University of Helsinki.
Research.
Tampere University is primarily a research university, whereas, Tampere University of Applied Sciences focuses on development. Pre-merger multidisciplinary collaboration was mainly conducted between the fields of signal processing, biotechnology and medical technology at the Institute of Biosciences and Medical Technology (BioMediTech). The University states that it aims to become a globally recognized research community in the areas of technology, health, and society research. The university has ten Finnish Centres of Excellence:
The University also comprises a single Nordic Centre of Excellence:
Furthermore, the University coordinates Academy of Finland's flagship programme on Photonics Research and Innovation (PREIN).
International collaboration.
The university is an active member of the University of the Arctic. UArctic is an international cooperative network based in the Circumpolar Arctic region, consisting of more than 200 universities, colleges, and other organizations with an interest in promoting education and research in the Arctic region. 
The university participates in UArctic's mobility program north2north. The aim of that program is to enable students of member institutions to study in different parts of the North.

Serratus Mountain

Serratus Mountain is a jagged, ridge-like mountain between Mount Tantalus (North) and Lake Lovely Water (South). Like most other peaks in the Tantalus Range, it is composed of loose rock. Most routes here are scrambles. The mountain is a standard single-day destination from the Jim Haberl hut.
Climate.
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Serratus Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Serratus.

Prix Chaudenay

The Prix Chaudenay is a Group 2 flat horse race in France open to three-year-old thoroughbreds. It is run at Longchamp over a distance of 3,000 metres (about miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late September or early October.
History.
The event was established in 1875, and it was originally called the Prix de l'Espérance. It took place in spring, and served as a trial for the Grand Prix de Paris.
The Prix de l'Espérance was abandoned throughout World War I, with no running from 1915 to 1918. During World War II, it was contested at Maisons-Laffitte in 1943, and Le Tremblay in 1944 and 1945.
The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Prix de l'Espérance was initially classed at Group 3 level. It was promoted to Group 2 status in 1987, and from this point it was staged in late June or early July.
The race was renamed in memory of Hubert de Chaudenay (1903–1989), a former president of the Société d'Encouragement, in 1990. Hubert's father Jean had been similarly honoured by the naming of the Prix Jean de Chaudenay.
The Prix Hubert de Chaudenay was run at Maisons-Laffitte in 1997 and 1998. It returned to Longchamp and was moved to the Saturday of Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe weekend in 1999. The latter race is traditionally held on the first Sunday of October.
The title of the race was shortened to Prix Chaudenay in 2004, when the Prix Jean de Chaudenay was discontinued. It now honours both father and son, Jean and Hubert de Chaudenay.

Bishop of Oxford

The Bishop of Oxford is the diocesan bishop of the Church of England Diocese of Oxford in the Province of Canterbury; his seat is at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The current bishop is Steven Croft, following the confirmation of his election to the See on 6 July 2016.
The Bishop of Oxford has authority throughout the diocese, but also has primary responsibility for the city and suburbs of Oxford, which form the Archdeaconry of Oxford.
From 1636 the Bishop was housed in the purpose-built Cuddesdon Palace.
History.
The origins of Christianity in this part of England go back at least to the 7th century, when Saint Birinus brought his mission to the West Saxons in 634. The West Saxon King Cynegils was baptised in the River Thames near the present site of Dorchester Abbey, where the original See was established.
The see was transferred in 1092 to Winchester, before being absorbed into the Diocese of Lincoln, the vast extent of which covered much of central and eastern England from the River Thames to the Humber.
King Henry VIII, acting now as head of the Church in England, established by Act of Parliament in 1542 six new dioceses, mostly out of the spoils of the suppressed monasteries. These six were Bristol, Chester, Gloucester, Oxford, Peterborough and Westminster. This intervention by Henry VIII saw a new see located at Osney in Oxfordshire in 1542 before finally being moved to its present location in the City of Oxford in 1546.
While the city gained prosperity from the accession of thousands of students, it was never, apart from the university, again prominent in history until the seventeenth century, when it became the headquarters of the Royalist party, and again the meeting-place of Parliament. The city of Oxford showed its Hanoverian sympathies long before the university, and feeling between them ran high in consequence. The area and population of the city remained almost stationary until about 1830, but since then it has grown rapidly.
Modern bishopric.
The modern diocese covers the counties of Oxfordshire, Berkshire, and Buckinghamshire, with parishes also in Bedfordshire, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, and Warwickshire. The see is in the City of Oxford where the seat is located at the Cathedral Church of Christ which was elevated to cathedral status in 1546, and which (uniquely among English dioceses) is also the chapel of Christ Church, Oxford.
The Oxford diocese at the present day contains the greatest number of parishes of any diocese on England (621) and also the most church buildings (815), of which 475 are grade 1 or 2* listed buildings.
Croft is the first to reside at the new Bishop's Lodge, Kidlington; "for decades" previously, bishops had resided at Linton Road in North Oxford. Each bishop signs "+ Christian name Oxon:"; e.g. "+ Steven Oxon:".

Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal

The Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal () is a political party in Bangladesh. The party was founded by Serajul Alam Khan. The party was dominant during the 1972–1975 Bangladesh insurgency. The current party president is Hasanul Haque Inu.
History.
The Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) was formed on 31 October 1972 when it split from Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the Bangladesh Awami League, under the leadership of Serajul Alam Khan, M. A. Jalil, ASM Abdur Rab and Shajahan Siraj. It had an armed wing, Gonobahini, led by Colonel Abu Taher and Hasanul Haq Inu, Kazi Aref Ahmed, Monirul Islam, Sharif Nurul Ambia that led a violent left-wing insurgency against the regime of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Their aim was to form a new left wing democratic national government, for facilitating establishing a socialist state with Bangladeshi characteristics. This led the government to use the pro-Mujib Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini (which consisted of die-hard loyalists to Mujib) to counter the insurgency by the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JASAD) activists.
Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
Before the coup of 15 August 1975, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal had planned to organize a mass upsurge to form a democratic national government replacing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
After Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family were assassinated on 15 August 1975, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal leader Abu Taher showed his support and remarked: "The corpse of Sheikh Mujib should have been thrown into The Bay of Bengal".
On 7 November 1975, forces loyal to Colonel Abu Taher rescued army chief Ziaur Rahman from house arrest. When Ziaur Rahman realized that Abu Taher was moving the country into a direction of leftist communism, which contradicted Zia's right wing views, Zia declared martial law, formed the right wing Bangladesh Nationalist Party and cracked down on the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal by executing Abu Taher and sentencing other leaders to various prison terms.
Factions.
During Ziaur Rahman's rule, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal split up twice. The party fragmented again during the regime of Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the 1980s, with ASM Abdur Rab and Shajahan Siraj heading two separate factions. Abdur Rab's faction, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal-JSD, became the opposition after taking part in the 1988 elections, that were boycotted by all major political parties. After the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) came to power in 1991, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal allied itself with former rivals Bangladesh Awami League to counter growing BNP and right wing influence in the country. ASM Abdur Rab later served as a minister from 1996 to 2001 in the Awami League-led government. After the BNP returned to power in 2001, Shajahan Siraj merged his party with it.
Meanwhile, Inu, who became MP after winning elections as a grand alliance nominee with the victorious Awami League's boat as his symbol in 2008, was made Information Minister. after another split, The general secretary of the Inu-led faction was Shirin Akhter.

Hatch mark

Hatch marks (also called hash marks or tick marks) are a form of mathematical notation. They are used in three ways as: 
Hatch marks are frequently used as an abbreviation of some common units of measurement. In regard to distance, a single hatch mark indicates feet, and two hatch marks indicate inches. In regard to time, a single hatch mark indicates minutes, and two hatch marks indicate seconds.
In geometry and trigonometry, such marks are used following an elevated circle to indicate degrees, minutes, and seconds — 
Hatch marks can probably be traced to hatching in art works, where the pattern of the hatch marks represents a unique tone or hue. Different patterns indicate different tones.
Unit and value marks.
Unit-and-value hatch marks are short vertical line segments which mark distances. They are seen on rulers and number lines. The marks are parallel to each other in an evenly-spaced manner.
The distance between adjacent marks is one unit. Longer line segments are used for integers and natural numbers. Shorter line segments are used for fractions.
Hatch marks provide a visual clue as to the value of specific points on the number line, even if some hatch marks are not labeled with a number.
Hatch marks are typically seen in number theory and geometry.
 
 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3
Congruency notation.
In geometry, hatch marks are used to denote equal measures of angles, arcs, line segments, or other elements.
Hatch marks for congruence notation are in the style of tally marks or of Roman numerals – with some qualifications. These marks are without serifs, and some patterns are not used. For example, the numbers I, II, III, V, and X are used, but IV and VI are not used, since a rotation of 180 degrees can make a 4 easily confused with a 6.
For example, if two triangles are drawn, the first pair of congruent sides can be marked with a single hatch mark on each. The second pair of congruent sides can be marked with two hatch marks each. The patterns are not alike: one pair uses one mark while the other pair uses two marks (Figure 1). This use of pattern makes it clear which sides are the same length, even if the sides cannot be measured. If the sides do not appear to be congruent, as long as hatch marks are present and are the same number of hatch marks, then the sides are congruent.
Note that the inverse situation should not be assumed. That is, while sides that are hatch marked identically must be assumed to be congruent, it does not follow that sides hatch marked "differently" must be "incongruent". The different hatch marks simply signal that the length measurements may (in this case) be considered to be "independent" of each other. So, for example, while we are not allowed to conclude that the triangles in the accompanying figure "must be" isosceles triangles (or even perhaps equilateral triangles), we yet remain obliged to allow that they "could be" either of those things.
Graphed points.
Line charts may sometimes use hatch marks as graphed points. In the early days of computers, monitors and printers could only make charts using the characters available on a common typewriter. To graph a line chart of sales over time, symbols such as *, x, or | were used to mark points, and various characters were used to mark the lines connecting them. While computers have advanced considerably, it is still not unusual to see x or | used as the points of interest (or points of change) on a graph.

Arthur's Treasured Volumes

Arthur's Treasured Volumes was a black-and-white British television series that aired on ITV in 1960. Starring Arthur Askey, it was written by Dave Freeman and was made for the ITV network by ATV.
All six episodes were missing having been presumed wiped during the 1960s, until part of the first episode "A Blow In Anger" was recovered by Paul Stroud and shown at the National Film Theatre in November 2003. The remaining episodes were re-discovered in ITV's archive by a researcher from archive television organisation Kaleidoscope in December 2019.
Plot.
"Arthur's Treasured Volumes" was a series of one-episode sitcoms. At the beginning of each episode, Anthea Askey, Arthur's daughter, takes down a book from a shelf and the story begins. All the 'books' are in fact scripts written by Dave Freeman. In each episode, Arthur Askey, Sam Kydd and Arthur Mullard play different roles. Amongst those who made guest appearances were Wilfrid Brambell, Patrick Newell, June Whitfield and Geoffrey Palmer.

Fouad Hussein

Fouad Hussein is a Jordanian journalist and author of the 2005 Arabic language book "Al-Zarqawi: The Second Generation of Al Qaeda". It is based on interviews with senior Islamic militants, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the late leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and Saif al-Adel, a high-ranking member of al-Qaeda and Islamic Jihad. Hussein first met Zarqawi and Zarqawi's mentor Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi in 1996 in a Jordanian jail. At the time, Hussein was being held as a political prisoner. Since its release, Hussein's book has garnered heavy press coverage and analysis in Iran. In the book Hussein describes what he says is al-Qaeda's grand strategy, a sequence of events that spreads over nearly 20 years.
First phase, "The First Awakening".
The stage began with the September 11th attacks, which were meant to lure the United States into military conflict in the Middle East. This stage, Hussein claimed, ended with the American capture of Baghdad in early April 2003.
Second phase, "Eye-Opening".
Al-Qaeda would become more than just an organization, but a popular trend fueled by the American occupation of Iraq and the Arab media through mediums like the Internet. This would last through 2006.
Third stage, "Arising and Standing Up".
Al-Qaeda would begin focusing its energies on attacking the secular governments in Syria and Turkey and also against Israel until 2010
Fourth stage, "Toppling the regimes".
Continuous weakening of American strength in the Middle East while also causing the capitulation of governments across the Arab world.
Fifth stage, "Declaration of Caliphate".
From 2013 to 2016, Hussein said the Islamic movement would have shifted the balance of power in the Middle East away from the West and Israel, and the Islamists would be supported by new allies such as China. In this environment a new caliphate will be established. Al Qaeda, he wrote, also expected the Americans to go after Iran's principal ally in the region, Syria. The removal of the Assad regime - a long-time goal of jihadis - would allow the country to be infiltrated by Al Qaeda, putting the terrorists within reach, at last, of Israel.
Sixth phase, "Total Confrontation".
Lasting until 2020, it is when an Islamic army and the newly formed caliphate would defeat the non-believers in a global conflict.
Final phase, "Definitive Victory".
The caliphate would rule the world, because the rest of the world will be so beaten down by the "one-and-a-half billion Muslims".
2014 Assessment.
Stage Four happened to pass with Arab Spring revolutions.
Stage Five was completed with ISIS's declaration of caliphate.

Tournai (Parliament of England constituency)

Tournai () was a possible former constituency of the Parliament of England between 1513 and 1519. It was created after the Kingdom of England captured the town from the Kingdom of France. The constituency was abolished in 1519 following the return of the town to France in exchange for a payment of 600,000 crowns.
Overview.
Tournai, the only town (now city) in modern Belgium ever to have been ruled by England, was under English control from around 23 September 1513 (after its capture from France during the 1513 Battle of Guinegate) and remained so until its return in 1519 to France upon the payment of 600,000 crowns following the Treaty of London in 1518. Aged 22, Henry VIII entered the town ceremonially on 25 September 1513. During part of the time during which the town was under English sovereignty, it was possibly represented in the Parliament of England by two Members of Parliament. Henry promised the town representation and allowed for them to use the French customary member's deputies to elect Tournai's MP. The only known member for the constituency was Jean Le Sellier.
However, Oxford historian C. S. L. Davies has argued that no such constituency ever existed, claiming that Henry viewed Tournai as a part of his claim to the Kingdom of France rather than as a new integral part of the Kingdom of England.
Election.
An election is believed by some to have taken place in about December 1513. It is not known if Tournai was represented in the 1515 Parliament as though Henry had requested the return of all previously elected members, Le Sellier was recorded as still being in Tournai four days after the Opening of Parliament.
Coinage.
Groat and half-groat coins were issued without a portrait of King Henry VIII but did display his name. Dated 1513, these were struck subsequent to the town's capture in 1513 from France and nowadays are exceptionally rare especially since they are the earliest British dated coins. The coin was struck naming Henry as "King of France and England" when English coins from the same period had the kingdoms reversed.

M. H. Khan

Musharraf Hussain Khan (known as M H Khan; 1 February 1932 – 13 October 2018) was a Bangladesh Navy admiral who served as the chief of the Bangladesh Navy from 7 November 1973 to 3 November 1979. He served as deputy chief martial law administrator of Bangladesh from 1975 to 1977 with Army Chief Ziaur Rahman and Air Chief Air Vice Marshal Muhammad Ghulam Tawab.
He achieved the rank of Captain and commanded several of the primary naval ships of the Pakistan Navy, including the cruiser and the flag ship destroyer . Admiral Khan created the Bangladesh Navy from scratch in very difficult circumstances but was able to create and implement the framework upon which the Bangladesh Navy has been built, following the scope and plan that he laid out in his six plus years as naval chief.
Early life and education.
Khan was born on 1 February 1932. Khan was the second of four sons of Moajjam H. Khan, who was director general (analysis wing) of Inter-Services Intelligence during the 1950s, and Shafia Khan.
He was educated in schools of several districts, as his father, being in the Imperial Police Service, moved frequently for work. In 1947, Mosharraf H. Khan was eager to join the Navy and commenced his naval journey by joining as a cadet at the naval boarding ship school, "Dufferin", located in Bombay (now Mumbai). He graduated in 1950 and then applied to join the Pakistan Navy. 
Career.
M. H. Khan joined the Pakistan Navy in 1950. Upon selection as a cadet in the Pakistan Navy, he was sent to the Royal Navy for training. In 1951 he entered Royal Naval College Dartmouth, and after a few years of sea time on RN ships, he subsequently, as a sub lieutenant was selected to attend the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1954. He served on several Royal Naval ships, including the aircraft carrier .
On completion of his sea time with the Royal Navy and his initial education and training at the Royal Naval Colleges Dartmouth and Greenwich, he returned to the UK in 1957, where he received further training in the UK at HMS Dryad in advanced navigation and direction, which became his naval specialization. 
Khan married Fahmida in January 1961. In 1964, he was selected for further training at the Defence Nuclear, Biological and Chemical School in England. Fahmida, leaving their young son in the care of her mother-in-law in Dhaka, flew out to join Khan in Salisbury, and the two of them toured Europe and the Middle East for six weeks on their way home.
Shortly after returning to Karachi, Khan was sent back to England to collect , a coastal patrol craft being built by Brooke Marine in Lowestoft. During the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, he patrolled from Karachi in the "Jessore". After the war he was deputed to the Ministry of Commerce to be Controller of Shipping in Karachi. On his return to the Pakistan Navy, he served as executive officer of two destroyers before being given command of the cruiser , the largest ship of the Pakistan Navy. In 1970, he commanded .
After the Bangladesh Liberation War broke out, he was relieved of sea duty, along with all other Bengali navy personnel, on 12 April 1971. For the remainder of the war, he was sent on training courses and held various shore positions. After the war, in March 1972, he and his family were interned in Pakistan Navy Station Karsaz.
He self-published an autobiography, "Memoir of M.H. Khan: Turbulence in the Indian Subcontinent", two years before his death.
Death.
Admiral M. H. Khan died on 12 October 2018 at Combined Military Hospital Dhaka.

Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America

The Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America (ABAA) is an organization in the United States for dealers in rare and antiquarian books. The association is a member of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB).
History.
Founded in 1949, the ABAA is the benchmark for professionalism and ethics in the rare book trade in the US. The founding of the ABAA was the direct result of the founding of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB) a year earlier: "It was quickly recognized in the United States that national and international cooperation among booksellers was an idea whose time had come and that an American association was vital for the interests of professional booksellers." An organizational meeting was held in New York City in 1949 to discuss the advisability of forming a national organization, with about 50 dealers in attendance, with Marston Drake (James F. Drake, Inc.) acting as informal chairman. The "Antiquarian Bookman" (later "AB Bookman's Weekly") reported in its issue of 5 March 1949 that "A great step forward towards the establishment of a genuine national association of antiquarian booksellers was taken" at this meeting, though "it was recognized that there were a great many differences, a long backlog of personal disputes and dissensions and an enormous field of individual views and prejudices" to deal with. "It was also recognized that all the above were some of the very reasons why a national association of antiquarian booksellers had to be formed: not merely to reconcile the differences but also to advance book-buying, to promote book-collecting, so that all would benefit from such increased activity in the book field." The first general meeting of the new association took place in March, with 81 dealers in attendance; annual dues were set at $10/year. The first president of the ABAA was Laurence Gomme (Brentano's).
"Book fairs are such a major element in the activities and functions of the present-day ABAA," writes Edwin Glaser (President of ABAA, 1986–88) "that it still comes as a surprise to be reminded that the first American antiquarian book fair did not take place until April of 1960." Encouraged by the success of the first British fair the previous year, the New York fair, held in the un-air-conditioned Steinway Hall on West 57th Street, featured 23 dealers occupying 20 booths. The fair opened with a 5pm preview on April 4, and ran for 12 hours/day for five more days, from 10am–10 pm; admission was free. Describing the event many years later, Madeleine B. Stern (Rostenberg &amp; Stern) writes: 
ABAA-sponsored antiquarian book fairs have prospered since 1960, as has the ABAA itself; the organization currently has more than 450 members.
Activities.
The non-profit organization's more than 450 members deal in rare books, autographs, historical documents, prints, and maps, and its members have provided guidance in building the world's foremost private and institutional collections. In addition to sales and guidance, many members offer appraisals. The association maintains a website featuring educational articles and resources about the rare book trade, as well as a searchable membership database. The website's database of books for sale lists approximately two million fine and rare books for sale by members. The ABAA also publishes an annual membership directory and a quarterly online newsletter. The association created the Elisabeth Woodburn Fund in honor of a past president of the association which periodically offers scholarships to members and non-members to further their education in the trade. The association's Benevolent Fund offers financial assistance to member and non-member booksellers in times of hardship. The ABAA is a sponsor, with FABS (Fellowship of American Bibliophilic Societies) and The Center for the Book and Rare Book and Manuscript Division in the Library of Congress, of the National Collegiate Book Collecting Contest.
Book fairs.
The ABAA currently hosts three antiquarian book fairs per year: California in February (Los Angeles and San Francisco in alternating years), New York in April, and Boston in November. Exhibitors must be members of the ABAA or of an ILAB association.
Website.
The ABAA has an e-commerce website hosted by Bibliopolis and Biblio.com which exhibits members' books for sale. The site, launched in 2009, features over 2 million rare books from 200 of its members and has full search, browse and e-commerce capabilities.
Membership.
Applicants must have been in the business of rare books or printed matter a minimum of four years, be sponsored by three current members, and provide three references as basic requirements for membership. The ABAA has a comprehensive code of ethics by which all of its members must abide, requiring authentication and accurate description of all items offered for sale.

<doc id="6966474" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6966474" title="Carrock Fell">
Carrock Fell

Carrock Fell is a fell in the English Lake District, situated in the northern region of the national park, north-east of Keswick.
Toponymy.
The name "Carrock" is a Brittonic formation. Sometimes stated as deriving from "carreg" meaning "rock, stony place", early attestations of the name suggest that is more likely to represent "*carr", "rock, hard-surface", with the adjectival and nominal suffix "-ǭg", sometimes meaning "abounding in".
Height.
The fell's elevation seems to have decreased by two metres in recent years. The Ordnance Survey now give it a height of in the most recent map updates after having recorded it at for many years. Many guidebooks and mountain tables still record 663 metres as the “official” height.
Topography.
Well known Lake District scribe Alfred Wainwright rated Carrock Fell as the second most exciting and interesting fell in the northern area of Lakeland (after Blencathra and before Skiddaw), it has special appeal regarding geology, mining and history and its rocky nature makes it stand out from the neighbouring fells which are mainly grassy and smooth. Carrock Fell is bounded to the south and east by the River Caldew into which all drainage from the fell goes to find its way eventually to the Solway Firth.
Geology.
Carrock Fell's geology is unique in the Lake District in that it is predominantly composed of gabbro, a rough igneous rock that also makes up the famous Black Cuillin on the Isle of Skye. Gabbro is an excellent “clean” rock for climbers and Carrock Fell offers the only rock climbing of quality in the northern fells, the majority of which are made up of the unsuitable crumbly Skiddaw Slate. The fell is rich in mineral ores and has been mined extensively for many centuries with tungsten, lead, arsenic and iron all being extracted from the fell. The most famous mine on the fell was the Carrock Mine, the only source of tungsten in Britain outside of Devon and Cornwall. The mine was situated in Grainsgill Beck on the south western flanks of the fell with the main adit at a height of 340 metres. The mine was opened in 1854 but has only been worked in periods when the price of tungsten has been high, for example during wartime, the mine was worked extensively during both World Wars and the Korean War when supplies of Tungsten were threatened. The mine closed in 1981 and in 1988 the site was bulldozed and landscaped to its original outline.
History.
Carrock Fell is also the site of an Iron Age hill fort which crowns the summit. Only the foundations of the walls remain. The fort is oval shaped and is believed to have been built by the Celts and destroyed by the Romans in their conquest of northern England. Carrock Fell's other claim to historical fame is that it was climbed by well-known British novelists Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins in 1857 during a tour of northern Cumberland. Dickens had read about the fell and had made up his mind to climb it.
Collins sprained his ankle and Dickens had to help him back down the mountain, according to The New Yorker 7/25/11 in an article by Jonathan Rosen. (Collins wrote the first English-language detective novel, "The Moonstone".)
Later, Collins and Dickens collaborated on a humorous narrative based in part upon their climb up Carrock Fell, entitled "The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices".
Ascents.
Despite all its other attractions, Carrock Fell is primarily the haunt of the fell walker; it is mostly climbed from the surfaced road which goes to the site of the Carrock Mine. It is possible to leave a car at and then climb the fell by the steep south-west slopes. Carrock Fell can also be climbed from the road between Mungrisedale and Hesket Newmarket, threading a way through the craggy and bouldery eastern slopes known as "Apronful of Stones".
Summit.
The top of the fell offers a good view to the east towards the Pennines across the Eden valley. Carrock Fell has two subsidiary summits, Round Knott () and Milton Hill () which lie to the west of the main summit on the ridge which continues to the adjoining fell of High Pike.

Muhammad Ghulam Tawab

Air Vice Marshal Muhammad Ghulam Tawab (1 July 1930 – 23 February 1999) was the second chief of the air staff of Bangladesh Air Force who also served as deputy chief martial law administrator of Bangladesh with General Ziaur Rahman and Admiral M. H. Khan from 1975 to 1976.
Early life.
Tawab was born in a village near Sylhet, of Bengal Province, British Indian Empire, on 1 July 1930. He was married to Henrietta, a German national, and has two sons and a daughter.
Career.
After graduating college, Tawab joined the Pakistan Air Force in 1951 and was commissioned with the 9th GD(P) course as a pilot officer in the Pakistan Air Force. He graduated from PAF College Risalpur on September 15, 1951. During 1965 War, he had led the Pathankot airstrike and was awarded Sitara-e-Jurat.
After Sheikh Mujib's assassination in August 1975, Tawab was immediately recalled from West Germany to active duty by then military chief, Major General Ziaur Rahman upon then Wing Commander M. Hamidullah Khan's advice. In October 1975, Tawab was promoted to Air Vice Marshal and appointed Chief of Air Staff replacing Air Vice Marshal A. K. Khandker. 
The Bengal Lancers were directly involved in the coup and killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. They were posted to Bogra Cantonment and their officers were sent into diplomatic posting outside of Bangladesh. Major General Ziaur Rahman, chief of Bangladesh Army, had difficulty moving the Bengal Lancers to Bogra but eventually succeeded after Air Vice Marshall Muhammad Ghulam Tawab, Chief of Bangladesh Air Force, threatened to use Air Force aircraft against the Bengal Lancers.
Air Vice Marshall Muhammad Ghulam Tawab addressed a rally of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami calling for Bangladesh to be changed from a secular state to an Islamic one. Tawab also brought back four army officers involved in the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and reinstated them in the Bengal Lancers at Bogra Cantonment. This led to the 1976 Bogra mutiny under Syed Faruque Rahman, one of the officers Tawab helped return to Bangladesh.
After the failed mutiny, Major General Ziaur Rahman retired Tawab, sent the four officers back, and disbanded the Bengal Lancers.
M. G. Tawab retired from Bangladesh Air Force in 1977 and returned to West Germany. He died in Munich on February 23, 1999, from prostate cancer after several years of illness.

Donald Rusk Currey

Donald Rusk Currey (January 24, 1934 – June 6, 2004) was an American professor of geography. While known in academia for his extensive research and exploration of relics of the ancient Lake Bonneville in the eastern Great Basin, he was best known to the public for his controversial felling of Prometheus, the oldest living non-clonal organism then known, while a graduate student in 1964.
Prometheus controversy.
Discovery and felling.
In 1963, Currey was a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Under a fellowship from the National Science Foundation, Currey was studying the climate dynamics of the Little Ice Age using dendrochronology techniques.
The bristlecone pines that grow in California, Nevada and Utah were discovered to be older than any species yet dated, and in 1963 Currey became aware of a Great Basin Bristlecone Pine population in the Snake Range and on Wheeler Peak in eastern Nevada in particular. At the time he visited the area, in the summer of 1964, he did not know that previous researchers had examined the area. Based on the size, growth rate and growth forms of some of the trees he became convinced that some very old specimens existed on the mountain and, using the scientific methods of the time, Currey began taking core samples to check. He found that some exceeded 3,000 years in age, taking particular interest in a tree he designated WPN-114, the previously named Prometheus.
Currey was unable to obtain a continuous series of overlapping cores from WPN-114: he had tried at least four times with a 28 inch long borer, breaking two borers, but to no avail. He decided to ask for permission from the United States Forest Service to fell the tree. He was already acquainted with Forest Service officials at the nearby Lehman Caves National Monument (later part of the much larger Great Basin National Park which includes the area Currey was working in), and made a request to Donald E. Cox, a district Forest Service ranger, for permission to cut down the tree in order to examine the whole trunk in cross-section. Cox felt that the request was scientifically sound and, after convincing superiors that the particular tree was not a landmark, gained approval for felling it.
After securing permission, Cox informed Currey and assigned a Forest Service crew to join the young researcher and bring back the samples. The tree was cut and sectioned on August 6, 1964, and several pieces of the sections hauled out to be processed and analyzed, first by Currey, then, later, by others. To their surprise, the tree was not only old, but older than any other non-clonal organism known until 2013, when the Methuselah tree passed the age of Prometheus.
Aftermath.
It took a few years for the information about the felling of Prometheus to reach the public, but once it did there was great controversy. Most criticism centered on the U.S. Forest Service's decision to permit the tree to be cut. Further, some critics questioned how the cutting of such an old tree was necessary given the topic Currey was studying. Since the Little Ice Age started no more than 600 years ago, many trees could presumably have provided the information he was after for that time period. However, in Currey's original report (Currey, 1965) he refers to the Little Ice Age as encompassing the entire period since 2000 BC, thus defining the Age over a much longer period than was later accepted. Whether this was common sentiment at the time is not known. In the article, Currey indicates that he sectioned the tree as much over the question of whether the oldest bristlecones were necessarily confined to California's White Mountains (as some dendrochronologists had been claiming) as from its usefulness in regard to studies of the Little Ice Age.
The incident led to a tighter restriction on the felling of old trees, the eventual creation of Great Basin National Park overseen by the National Park Service, and the decision to hide the exact location of Methuselah, the tree then believed to be the oldest. Currey personally lobbied to get Congress to designate the area part of a national park.
Later career.
Currey went on to a successful academic career. By the time his paper on his finding was published in the journal "Ecology", he had become a member of the faculty at Chapel Hill. He went on to earn his Ph.D. in 1969 from the University of Kansas and joined the faculty of the Department of Geography at the University of Utah in 1970, becoming full and later "Professor Emeritus". 
He spent over two decades researching and exploring relics of ancient Lake Bonneville in the eastern Great Basin. His papers on Lake Bonneville became the most cited papers in his department. His work examined the geomorphology of lakes, paleolakes, lake basins, and coasts; paleolimnology and geochronology of Quaternary lakes; geodynamics of Quaternary lakes; geoarchaeology; and desert, mountain, and Arctic environmental change.
Death.
Currey died at age 70 on June 6, 2004, shortly after being hospitalized for a sudden illness. He was honored during the 2005 Annual Meeting of the Association of American Geographers, with an annual field trip by The Geological Society of America, and the University of Utah Department of Geography established a scholarship in his name.

Action Deaf Youth

Action Deaf Youth is the largest deaf youth organisation in Northern Ireland, headquartered in Belfast. Founded in 1988 as the Northern Ireland Deaf Youth Association, it is a registered charity offering mentoring, training and volunteer services to deaf children and young people up to the age of 30. Services provided include play therapy sessions and sign camps, and youth clubs and events enabling deaf teens to participate in their communities and meet and build relationships with their peers across Northern Ireland.
Background.
The Northern Ireland Deaf Youth Association (NIDYA) was set up in 1988 by a group of 12 young people, including individuals from different regions of Northern Ireland, who identified a shared feeling of isolation and need for support. For many years, it was based out of Wilton House in Belfast. Through the 1990s, the association was led by co-founder Malachy McBurney, and received help in fundraising from Tom Ferguson, an avid supporter of the Deaf community in Northern Ireland.
In 2001, the NIDYA co-authored a landmark report with the University of Ulster titled, "Big 'D' wee 'd': The lives of young deaf people in Northern Ireland". The study was the first of its kind to be conducted in Northern Ireland, and found that young deaf people faced "discrimination, cultural isolation and segregation in schools and the workplace". Based on the report's findings, University of Ulster and NIDYA called on the Department of Education to review the standard of education provision for deaf children, questioning why 40% of deaf children in Northern Ireland were forced to leave their families at a young age to attend specialist schools in Dublin and England.
Services.
The organisation provides an early childhood service called "Let's Play and Grow" for deaf children from infants to eight years of age and their families. Group play sessions led by a team of specialists help deaf children with language acquisition, communication, peer interaction, and literacy. They can also help parents learn sign language, so they can communicate more effectively with their children at home. During school holidays, Action Deaf Youth offers outdoor play camps for deaf children aged four to eight, along with their siblings.
It also provides Play and Creative Arts Therapy sessions for children between the ages of 3 and 12+ experiencing emotional and psychological challenges or issues with behaviour, which are available by referral only.
For youths ages 11 through 25, Action Deaf Youth offers youth support throughout Northern Ireland, through youth clubs that develop skills, self-confidence, and friendships, and encourage young people to explore ways to manage their deafness. In addition, the charity has worked with mainstream youth clubs to raise awareness about deafness.
Events and programmes.
Action Deaf Youth organises numerous events and programmes for deaf children and young people. It has hosted free employment and training support days for school leavers, with participation from organisations such as the British Deaf Association and D'Sign Arts NI.
The organisation also encourages members to lobby politicians on issues affecting deaf youth. In 2015, Action Deaf Youth organised a bilateral exchange with the Hungarian Association of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (SINOSZ). As part of the exchange, 18 delegates from Northern Ireland, aged 16 to 25, visited Hungary and learned about how legislation in that country has improved the rights and quality of life of deaf people. Following the visit, they headed to Stormont to meet with members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) to demand better support for sign language and improved access to services.
Funding.
In 2002, the Northern Ireland Youth Deaf Association was one of 62 projects in Northern Ireland to receive funding from the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.
In 2015, NIDYA received a grant of €25,000 from Erasmus+, the EU programme for education, training, youth and sport. The grant was for its project with SINOSZ, the youth group in Hungary.
In 2016, Action Deaf Youth received a grant of £675,304 from the Big Lottery Fund's Supporting Families programme, for its five-year project, "Supporting Families of Deaf Children through Active Play".
Prior to Brexit, Action Deaf Youth was a recipient of a grant from the European Social Fund (ESF) for its employability programme, "Supporting Deaf Young People Into Employment".
In 2022, 55 barristers from the Bar Library of Northern Ireland raised £16,000 for Action Deaf Youth, through their participation in 11 relay teams during the Belfast City Marathon.

Gandhigiri

Gandhigiri is a neologism in India which is used to express the tenets of Gandhism (the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi, which include Satyagraha and Ahimsa) in contemporary terms. The term became popular due to its usage in the 2006 Hindi film, "Lage Raho Munna Bhai".
Usage.
As a colloquial expression in various languages in India including Marathi, Hindi and Tamil, "Gandhigiri" refers to the practice of the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi. It is a colloquial form of Gandhism. "Gandhism" (or "Gandhianism") is a term which attempts to summarize the philosophies of Mahatma Gandhi. Basic tenets of Gandhism include "satya" (truth) and "Satyagraha": "Truth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force...that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or non-violence." Gandhi further noted of the term, "Satyagraha",
In this context, "Gandhigiri" is sometimes juxtaposed to "Dadagiri" (bullying) (as it was in "Lage Raho Munna Bhai," where Munna Bhai had to learn to give up "Dadagiri" in exchange for "Gandhigiri").
Popularization of term.
Overview.
"Lage Raho Munna Bhai" is a 2006 Indian musical comedy directed by Rajkumar Hirani and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Sanjay Dutt stars in this film as "Munna Bhai," a local don of Mumbai (Bombay), who begins to see the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi. Through his interactions with the image of Gandhi, Munna Bhai begins to practice what he calls "Gandhigiri" to help ordinary people solve their problems.
Some have argued that the thematic attention to Gandhi's theories in "Lage Raho Munna Bhai" has both revived an interest in "Gandhism" under the new term, "Gandhigiri" in India and has likewise "made Gandhi suddenly hip. Inspired by the hit movie, Indians are increasingly embracing his philosophy, staging nonviolent protests, starting Web sites, handing out roses to enemies and putting on peaked white caps from the Gandhi era." Indeed, according to reports, Gandhi is now a "new pop icon" in India and as Arunabha Ghosh notes, "Gandhi, the man, was once the message. In the India of the post-liberalisation brand, Gandhigiri is the message." Several websites and internet forums were created, encouraging people to return to the Gandhian philosophy.
Theories for this sudden revival vary. Some have suggested that this phenomenon could be attributed to the film simplifying Gandhi's "lofty ideals" and conveying them "in contemporary, colloquial language. Others, according to "The Christian Science Monitor", have noted that the appeal of the film lies in the fact that "Gandhi gets his hands dirty. He appears as an apparition only visible to the wayward gangster, counselling him on how to help others deal with everyday problems." Whatever the reason, a 13 October 2006 article in "The Boston Globe", suggests that the revival has had a positive impact in India and states, "What America needs is a film that encourages people to take up Gandhigiri, Kinggiri, or Kennedygiri. If it worked for Bollywood, it could work for Hollywood."
Gandhigiri-style protests.
Since the release of the film, there have been instances where peaceful protests were either dubbed "Gandhigiri" or the protesters have claimed that they have been inspired by the movie. In the United States during July 2007, piles of flowers were sent to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services office by individuals who were legally in the U.S. but caught in a green card backlog. This was an act of Gandhigiri (or nonviolent protest) copied from "Lage Raho Munna Bhai". There have been positive reactions to this event. The USCIS shipped the flowers to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and Bethesda Naval hospitals. A 15 July 2007 editorial in "The Baltimore Sun" argued, "let's hope their protest gets results - because Americans are fortunate to have living among them people who are this ingenious, and this thoughtful of others, and this capable of channeling anger into beauty." On 17 July, the USCIS announced that "it will accept applications from foreign professionals seeking permanent residency through an expedited process, reversing its earlier decision." USCIS Director, Emilio T. Gonzalez noted of the Gandhigiri protest, "The public reaction to the July 2 announcement made it clear that the federal government's management of this process needs further review [...] I am committed to working with Congress and the State Department to implement a more efficient system in line with public expectations."
In India, farmers stage a protest with flowers in the Vidarbha region, and people who organized a protest in Lucknow claimed to have been inspired by "Lage Raho Munna Bhai" to use roses to convey their message. In Lucknow students claimed to have been inspired by "Lage Raho Munna Bhai" to do volunteer work, planting trees "to conserve nature which is bound to benefit public health." Mafia don Babloo Srivastava claimed to have been inspired by "Lago Raho Munna Bhai" to distribute roses as a "message of love and peace".

Bishop of Peterborough

The Bishop of Peterborough is the ordinary of the Church of England Diocese of Peterborough in the Province of Canterbury.
The diocese covers the counties of Northamptonshire (including the Soke of Peterborough) and Rutland. The see is in the City of Peterborough, where the bishop's seat ("cathedra") is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter, Saint Paul and Saint Andrew. The bishop's residence is Bishop's Lodging, The Palace, Peterborough. The office has been in existence since the foundation of the diocese on 4 September 1541 under King Henry VIII.
The current Bishop of Peterborough is Debbie Sellin, since the confirmation, on 13 December 2023 at Lambeth Palace Chapel, of her election.
As parts of the City of Peterborough are actually in the Diocese of Ely (those parishes south of the River Nene), the last Bishop of Peterborough was appointed as an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Ely with pastoral care for these parishes delegated to him by the Bishop of Ely.

Oxford University Rowing Clubs (OURCs) is a federation of the Oxford University Boat Club (OUBC) and all Oxford college boat clubs. OURCs is a purely administrative organisation with no training or crews. It was created in 1986 in order to remove the organisational burden from the university squad and is responsible for organising inter-collegiate competitions and overseeing the conduct of college rowing. The student-led organisation of OURCs is supported by senior members of the university, the Council for Oxford University Rowing, which issues advice and deals with aspects of rowing safety. A similar function is fulfilled by the Cambridge University Combined Boat Clubs for rowing clubs of the University of Cambridge.

Jack Root

John Arthur Root, born as Janos Ruthaly and known professionally as Jack Root (May 26, 1876 – June 10, 1963) was an American boxer. He was the first world light heavyweight champion as well as a challenger for the world heavyweight title. He fought out of Chicago. He was elected into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2011.
Championship Claim.
Root (with the support of some historians) claimed that he was the first world light heavyweight champion. His bout with George Gardiner on July 4, 1903, is claimed by some to be the first title bout in the new division. Root contended that his manager, Lou Housman, created the division and billed the Root vs. Gardner fight, which Gardner won by knockout in the twelfth round. The fight was caught on film. Jack Root, George Gardner, and Bob Fitzsimmons all held the light heavyweight world championship title in 1903.
During the 1980s, however, some boxing historians found records indicating that Joe Choynski won a twenty-round decision over Jimmy Ryan on August 18, 1899, in a fight billed as being for the light heavyweight championship. Choynski never seems to have made any claim to be the first light heavyweight champion, however.
Heavyweight title fight.
On July 3, 1905, Root fought Marvin Hart for the vacant world heavyweight championship in Reno Nevada. The former champion, Jim Jeffries, had retired and declared that Hart and Root were the two top heavyweights. Jeffries refereed the fight to name the new champion, which Hart won by a twelfth-round knockout.
After boxing.
Root served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War I. After his time in the service Root became the president and boxing manager of the renowned Los Angeles Olympic Auditorium. Root was also one of many boxers to attend the funeral of Feab S. Williams (better known as "George Godfrey").
Death.
Root died on June 10, 1963, at Temple Hospital in Los Angeles from a heart attack, aged 87.

<doc id="6966559" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6966559" title="Nanocrystalline material">
Nanocrystalline material

A nanocrystalline (NC) material is a polycrystalline material with a crystallite size of only a few nanometers. These materials fill the gap between amorphous materials without any long range order and conventional coarse-grained materials. Definitions vary, but nanocrystalline material is commonly defined as a crystallite (grain) size below 100 nm. Grain sizes from 100 to 500 nm are typically considered "ultrafine" grains.
The grain size of a NC sample can be estimated using x-ray diffraction. In materials with very small grain sizes, the diffraction peaks will be broadened. This broadening can be related to a crystallite size using the Scherrer equation (applicable up to ~50 nm), a Williamson-Hall plot, or more sophisticated methods such as the Warren-Averbach method or computer modeling of the diffraction pattern. The crystallite size can be measured directly using transmission electron microscopy.
Synthesis.
Nanocrystalline materials can be prepared in several ways. Methods are typically categorized based on the phase of matter the material transitions through before forming the nanocrystalline final product.
Solid-state processing.
Solid-state processes do not involve melting or evaporating the material and are typically done at relatively low temperatures. Examples of solid state processes include mechanical alloying using a high-energy ball mill and certain types of severe plastic deformation processes.
Liquid processing.
Nanocrystalline metals can be produced by rapid solidification from the liquid using a process such as melt spinning. This often produces an amorphous metal, which can be transformed into an nanocrystalline metal by annealing above the crystallization temperature.
Vapor-phase processing.
Thin films of nanocrystalline materials can be produced using vapor deposition processes such as MOCVD.
Solution processing.
Some metals, particularly nickel and nickel alloys, can be made into nanocrystalline foils using electrodeposition.
Mechanical properties.
Nanocrystalline materials show exceptional mechanical properties relative to their coarse-grained varieties. Because the volume fraction of grain boundaries in nanocrystalline materials can be as large as 30%, the mechanical properties of nanocrystalline materials are significantly influenced by this amorphous grain boundary phase. For example, the elastic modulus has been shown to decrease by 30% for nanocrystalline metals and more than 50% for nanocrystalline ionic materials. This is because the amorphous grain boundary regions are less dense than the crystalline grains, and thus have a larger volume per atom, formula_1. Assuming the interatomic potential, formula_2, is the same within the grain boundaries as in the bulk grains, the elastic modulus, formula_3, will be smaller in the grain boundary regions than in the bulk grains. Thus, via the rule of mixtures, a nanocrystalline material will have a lower elastic modulus than its bulk crystalline form.
Nanocrystalline metals.
The exceptional yield strength of nanocrystalline metals is due to grain boundary strengthening, as grain boundaries are extremely effective at blocking the motion of dislocations. Yielding occurs when the stress due to dislocation pileup at a grain boundary becomes sufficient to activate slip of dislocations in the adjacent grain. This critical stress increases as the grain size decreases, and these physics are empirically captured by the Hall-Petch relationship, 
where formula_5 is the yield stress, formula_6 is a material-specific constant that accounts for the effects of all other strengthening mechanisms, formula_7 is a material-specific constant that describes the magnitude of the metal's response to grain size strengthening, and formula_8 is the average grain size. Additionally, because nanocrystalline grains are too small to contain a significant number of dislocations, nanocrystalline metals undergo negligible amounts of strain-hardening, and nanocrystalline materials can thus be assumed to behave with perfect plasticity.
As the grain size continues to decrease, a critical grain size is reached at which intergranular deformation, i.e. grain boundary sliding, becomes more energetically favorable than intragranular dislocation motion. Below this critical grain size, often referred to as the “reverse” or “inverse” Hall-Petch regime, any further decrease in the grain size weakens the material because an increase in grain boundary area results in increased grain boundary sliding. Chandross &amp; Argibay modeled grain boundary sliding as viscous flow and related the yield strength of the material in this regime to material properties as 
where formula_10 is the enthalpy of fusion, formula_11 is the atomic volume in the amorphous phase, formula_12 is the melting temperature, and formula_13 is the volume fraction of material in the grains vs the grain boundaries, given by formula_14, where formula_15 is the grain boundary thickness and typically on the order of 1 nm. The maximum strength of a metal is given by the intersection of this line with the Hall-Petch relationship, which typically occurs around a grain size of formula_8 = 10 nm for BCC and FCC metals.
Due to the large amount of interfacial energy associated with a large volume fraction of grain boundaries, nanocrystalline metals are thermally unstable. In nanocrystalline samples of low-melting point metals (i.e. aluminum, tin, and lead), the grain size of the samples was observed to double from 10 to 20 nm after 24 hours of exposure to ambient temperatures. Although materials with higher melting points are more stable at room temperatures, consolidating nanocrystalline feedstock into a macroscopic component often requires exposing the material to elevated temperatures for extended periods of time, which will result in coarsening of the nanocrystalline microstructure. Thus, thermally stable nanocrystalline alloys are of considerable engineering interest. Experiments have shown that traditional microstructural stabilization techniques such as grain boundary pinning via solute segregation or increasing solute concentrations have proven successful in some alloy systems, such as Pd-Zr and Ni-W.
Nanocrystalline ceramics.
While the mechanical behavior of ceramics is often dominated by flaws, i.e. porosity, instead of grain size, grain-size strengthening is also observed in high-density ceramic specimens. Additionally, nanocrystalline ceramics have been shown to sinter more rapidly than bulk ceramics, leading to higher densities and improved mechanical properties, although extended exposure to the high pressures and elevated temperatures required to sinter the part to full density can result in coarsening of the nanostructure.
The large volume fraction of grain boundaries associated with nanocrystalline materials causes interesting behavior in ceramic systems, such as superplasticity in otherwise brittle ceramics. The large volume fraction of grain boundaries allows for a significant diffusional flow of atoms via Coble creep, analogous to the grain boundary sliding deformation mechanism in nanocrystalline metals. Because the diffusional creep rate scales as formula_17 and linearly with the grain boundary diffusivity, refining the grain size from 10 μm to 10 nm can increase the diffusional creep rate by approximately 11 orders of magnitude. This superplasticity could prove invaluable for the processing of ceramic components, as the material may be converted back into a conventional, coarse-grained material via additional thermal treatment after forming.
Processing.
While the synthesis of nanocrystalline feedstocks in the form of foils, powders, and wires is relatively straightforward, the tendency of nanocrystalline feedstocks to coarsen upon extended exposure to elevated temperatures means that low-temperature and rapid densification techniques are necessary to consolidate these feedstocks into bulk components. A variety of techniques show potential in this respect, such as spark plasma sintering or ultrasonic additive manufacturing, although the synthesis of bulk nanocrystalline components on a commercial scale remains untenable.

Centre for Deaf Studies, Dublin

The Centre for Deaf Studies is part of the School of Linguistic, Speech and Communication Sciences, Trinity College Dublin and is the only university offering Deaf Studies related courses on the island of Ireland.
The Centre originally offered a range of two-year full-time Diploma courses in (i) ISL Teaching, (ii) ISL/English Interpreting and (iii) Deaf Studies. Since 2009, a four-year honors Bachelor in Deaf Studies has been running. Students follow a common two-year programme, specializing in Deaf Studies or Interpreting or Teaching in the sophister years (third and fourth).
History.
Established in 2001, following a decade of campaigning by the Irish Deaf Society, the Centre for Deaf Studies was originally located at Waterloo Lane, Dublin 4. By 2003, more space was needed and the Centre moved to the first floor of St. Vincent's Centre for the Deaf, Drumcondra, Dublin 9, where it remained until 2010. In autumn 2010, the Centre moved to its new home at 7-9 Leinster Street South, a College owned premises.
The core faculty at the Centre for Deaf Studies are: Dr. John Bosco Conama, Ms. Carmel Grehan, Prof. Lorraine Leeson, Ms. Teresa Lynch, Mr. Patrick A. Matthews and Dr. Sarah Sheridan.

Research.
The Centre has engaged in a wide range of research activity to date, working to fulfill its remit of developing the discipline of Deaf Studies in Ireland. Work includes the development of the Signs of Ireland corpus, a digital multimodal corpus annotated in ELAN. The Signs of Ireland corpus is used in teaching and learning at the Centre and was the basis for Lorraine Leeson and John Saeed's volume describing the linguistic and sociolinguistic situation of Irish Sign Language (Edinburgh University Press, 2012) and several postgraduate dissertations.
CDS staff (Leeson, Matthews, Sheridan) have also built an Irish Sign Language as a second language acquisition corpus (SLAC), which staff and students are working to annotate. The SLAC-ISL corpus is a parallel corpus, built in collaboration with colleagues at Stockholm University (Scrönström, Mesch). This is one of the first L2 sign language corpus projects in the world.
Other work has centered on the application of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages to ISL teaching and assessment, the assessment of interpreters, deaf education, interpreters in educational contexts, interpreters in medical contexts, interpreters in mental health settings, interpreter career trajectories, the psychology of L2-M2 learners, the context of deaf children acquiring ISL at home, and work on deaf peoples’ access to employment, etc.
The Centre is home to an Applied Sign Linguistics lab, with a cohort of PhD and masters by research candidates working with classic Grounded Theory methodology. Academics have also supported students working on descriptive, functional and cognitive linguistic driven analyses of sign languages.
The Laura Sadlier Freshman Prize and the Laura Sadlier Sophister Award were officially founded in 2014 in recognition of the outstanding contributions made to the Centre for Deaf Studies by Laura Sadlier. These prizes will be presented annually to Junior Freshman students from the Centre for Deaf Studies who have demonstrated significant improvement in ISL proficiency and/or cultural engagement with the Deaf Community and to Senior Sophister students from the Centre for Deaf Studies. The recipient of this award will have demonstrated academic achievement, collegiality and engagement with the Deaf Community during the course of their studies.

The Club (dining club)

The Club or Literary Club is a London dining club founded in February 1764 by Joshua Reynolds, Samuel Johnson, and Edmund Burke.
Description.
Initially, the Club would meet one evening per week at seven, at the Turk's Head Inn in Gerrard Street, Soho. Later, meetings were reduced to once per fortnight whilst Parliament was in session, and were held at rooms in St James's Street. Though the initial formation was proposed by Sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr. Samuel Johnson became the person most closely associated with the Club.
John Timbs, in his "Club Life in London", gives an account of the Club's centennial dinner in 1864, which was celebrated at the Clarendon hotel. Henry Hart Milman, the English historian, was treasurer. The Club's toast, no doubt employing a bit of wishful thinking, was "Esto perpetua", Latin for "Let it be perpetual". This Latin phrase traces its origin to the last dying declaration of Paolo Sarpi (1552–1623) the Venetian theologian, philosopher and canon law expert who uttered these words towards the Venetian Republic, whose independence he devoutly espoused. The introduction of the phrase to Britain was probably through Sir Joshua Reynolds who went to Italy for his higher training in Renaissance art and painting with the contemporary Italian masters.
Members.
The nine original members were:
Hereafter membership was by unanimous election only. Existing members would submit a black ball if a nominee was disfavored. Shortly following the establishment of the original nine, Samuel Dyer became the first elected member. Hawkins left in 1768, suffering ostracism for his verbal abuse of Burke. Membership was then increased to 12; the new seats were filled by barrister Robert Chambers, and writers Thomas Percy and George Colman. A membership of 12 was deemed optimal to retain a qualitative exclusivity. Of Johnson's goal, Percy claimed:
It was intended the Club should consist of Such men, as that if only Two of them chanced to meet, they should be able to entertain each other without wanting the addition of more Company to pass the Evening agreeably.
Later member Charles Burney wrote that Johnson wanted a group "composed of the heads of every liberal and literary profession" and "have somebody to refer to in our doubts and discussions, by whose Science we might be enlightened."
The Club grew to 16 members in 1773, then to 21 in late 1775. Newly elected were: David Garrick, Adam Smith (economist, philosopher), Sir William Jones (philologist), George Steevens, (Shakespearean commentator), James Boswell (diarist, author), Charles James Fox (M.P.), George Fordyce (physician/chemist), James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont, Agmondesham Vesey, Sir Thomas Charles Bunbury, Edward Gibbon (author), and Thomas Barnard.
By 1783 the number had risen again to 35, including several Whig politicians, so that Johnson and other older members began to attend dinners less frequently. Johnson even founded another club, the Essex Head Club. A fact often neglected was that when the Club was founded, Edmund Burke had already founded a successful political and debating society, Edmund Burke's Club (in 1747), whilst still a student at Trinity College, Dublin. It has been suggested that the Club was initially no more than a kind of friendship club, initiated by Joshua Reynolds to help the lonely Dr Samuel Johnson. But it was no doubt Burke who pushed for the idea of a Club rather than just a circle of friends, and it was his personality that had the greater influence; hence the increasingly political nature of the Club in the next century.
By 1791, eight years after the death of Johnson, the membership recorded by James Boswell included:
19th century.
The historian Henry Reeve recorded details of Club membership in his diaries.
Members in the 1800s included:
By 1881, the members of the club included John Tyndall, Sir Frederic Leighton, and Lord Houghton, with Henry Reeve serving as treasurer. Other prominent 19th century members included Lord Macaulay, Thomas Huxley, Lord Acton, Lord Dufferin, W. H. E. Lecky, and Prime Minister Lord Salisbury.
20th century.
Winston Churchill and F. E. Smith had both desired to join The Club but were considered too controversial. In response, in 1911, they founded The Other Club, which continues to maintain itself as a political dining society. Meanwhile, The Club continues, meeting at Brooks's.

Igor Antón

Igor Antón Hernández (born 2 March 1983) is a Spanish former professional road bicycle racer, who rode professionally between 2005 and 2018 for the , and squads.
Career.
Born in Galdakao, Basque Country, Antón's first major achievement after turning professional in 2005, was winning the sixteenth stage of the 2006 Vuelta a España, between Almería and the Calar Alto Observatory.
After impressing his team directors in 2007, where he won a stage at the Tour de Romandie, Antón was soon picked out to be the team leader for the general classification (GC) in the 2007 Vuelta a España where he ended up finishing 8th overall. The year started well, and in June he came second in the Euskal Bizikleta. Later in the same month, Antõn won the second stage in the UCI ProTour race Tour de Suisse. In the GC he came home third. In September at the Vuelta a España, Antón was in the best form of his career and held the pace of the likes of Alberto Contador and Alejandro Valverde up the mountains. A fall on the stage to Alto de L'Angliru ended his ambitions in the Vuelta. The fall caused a fractured collarbone, and Antón's season came to an early end.
The 2009 season started slowly for Antón. He started the Tour de France in July, but failed to make a great impression. The Tour was filled with bad luck for Antón as he had at least three falls during the start of the three-week race. However, Antón came out of the Tour in great form and took the season's only victory on 2 August, when he won the Subida a Urkiola.
In 2010, Anton proved to be a formidable rider in the Classics, taking 4th at La Flèche Wallonne and 6th at Liège–Bastogne–Liège. In the Vuelta a España, Anton won Stage 4 and Stage 11 giving him the leader's jersey. However, on Stage 14 whilst wearing the leader's jersey, Anton crashed heavily on a descent and was forced to retire.
In 2011, Anton won two grand tour stages. He won Stage 14 in the Giro d'Italia and Stage 19 in the Vuelta a España which were both summit finishes, the latter almost a 'home' stage with familiar climbs in Biscay and concluding in Bilbao.
In 2012, Anton built his whole season on the 2012 Vuelta a España. He ended up finishing 9th overall after an impressive race in the mountains.
Antón joined the for the 2014 season, after his previous team –  – folded at the end of the 2013 season.
In May 2015, Antón renewed with victory after a four-year drought. He won the mountainous first stage of the Vuelta a Asturias with fourteen seconds of an advantage over former Euskaltel teammate Amets Txurruka of . He would not let go of the lead on stage two, which was the last stage of the race. He finished with the lead group of five riders.
Anton retired from racing after the last stage of the 2018 Vuelta a España. He was celebrated by the public on the streets of Madrid, when riding in front of the peloton for a while. A few months later, his career was honoured by local football club Athletic Bilbao at their stadium prior to a derby match against Eibar.

Joe Lauzon (born May 22, 1984) is a semi-retired American professional mixed martial artist who competed in the UFC's Lightweight division. Described as a well-rounded fighter, he has the most post-fight bonus awards in UFC Lightweight history with 15. Joe's younger brother, Dan Lauzon, is also a mixed martial artist.
Background.
Joseph Edward Lauzon Jr. was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, on May 22, 1984. He lived there until he was in the third grade, when he moved to Bridgewater. Lauzon lived on a small farm and enjoyed riding horses. The young Lauzon and his friends were interested in professional wrestling, and would re-enact moves on Lauzon's trampoline. Lauzon did not begin training in the martial arts until his junior year at East Bridgewater High School, after seeing a demonstration that piqued his interest. Lauzon graduated from Wentworth Institute of Technology in 2007 with a Bachelor's degree in computer science. He worked as a network administrator in Cambridge, Massachusetts before he began training in mixed martial arts full-time.
Mixed martial arts career.
Early career.
Lauzon's first amateur fight was in 2002. He held a 5–3 record as an amateur.
In 2004, Lauzon had his first cage fight, winning with a first round armbar in a local Massachusetts promotion, Mass Destruction. Lauzon then went on an eight fight winning streak with all the fights ending via submission. Lauzon won an eight-man tournament, defeating three fighters in one night in the World Fighting League and was crowned the WFL Grand Prix Champion. Lauzon was also named 2004 Massachusetts fighter of the year by local Massachusetts MMA outlets.
Lauzon made his debut in the UFC upsetting former UFC Lightweight Champion Jens Pulver at UFC 63 on September 23, 2006, winning via KO in 48 seconds and beating 7-to-1 odds. He was awarded a "Knockout of the Night" award.
Lauzon has been sponsored throughout his career by independent record label Massachusetts-based Deathwish Inc.
The Ultimate Fighter.
Lauzon was a contestant on "The Ultimate Fighter 5", which featured lightweights exclusively. He was on B.J. Penn's team, against a team coached by Jens Pulver. Lauzon defeated Brian Geraghty in the preliminary round. He then defeated Cole Miller in the quarterfinals. The win was somewhat controversial due to an illegal strike to the back of Miller's head. Miller appeared obviously dazed by the illegal strike and was given time to recover. However, when action was restarted, it was clear that Cole was still feeling the effects of the strike. Lauzon capitalized on it and won the fight. In the semi-finals, Lauzon lost a unanimous decision to Manvel Gamburyan. At the finale, he defeated Brandon Melendez via submission (triangle choke) at 2:09 of round two. This fight earned him a "Submission of the Night" award.
Ultimate Fighting Championship.
At UFC 78 Lauzon submitted previously undefeated Jason Reinhardt by rear-naked choke in the first round. Lauzon quickly took Reinhardt down before moving to the north–south position. Reinhardt rolled, giving Lauzon his back, and Lauzon quickly sunk in the rear-naked choke for a quick submission victory.
On April 2, 2008, Kenny Florian defeated Lauzon in the main event of UFC Fight Night 13 by TKO via strikes from mount in the second round. The first round was back and forth as Florian opened up a cut on Lauzon's head with elbows and took his back while Lauzon landed several takedowns and attempted several submissions. Florian opened the second round with a takedown and soon advanced to mount where he landed multiple unanswered strikes until the fight was waved off. This fight earned him a "Fight of the Night" award.
Lauzon defeated Kyle Bradley by technical knockout in round two at UFC Fight Night 15 on September 17, 2008. In the first round Bradley connected with a punch and rocked Lauzon. Lauzon managed to recover and continued to trade with Bradley in a close first round. In the second round Lauzon scored a takedown and transitioned quickly into mount before taking Bradley's back. Lauzon landed several punches from this position until the referee stepped in to save Bradley.
Lauzon was scheduled to fight former WEC Lightweight Champion, Hermes Franca on February 7, 2009, in the main event for UFC Fight Night 17. However, Franca pulled out of the event with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. Jeremy Stephens stepped in as a late replacement. Lauzon defeated Stephens by armbar in the second round, which earned him a "Submission of the Night" bonus award.
Lauzon fought Sam Stout on January 2, 2010, at UFC 108 and lost in a very entertaining fight by decision, which also won "Fight of the Night" bonus award.
Lauzon was expected to face Terry Etim on August 28, 2010, at UFC 118, but Etim had to withdraw from the bout due to injury. Lauzon was instead set to fight fellow Ultimate Fighter season 5 castmate Gabe Ruediger. During the UFC 118 weigh-ins Ruediger brought Lauzon a cake that read "Sorry for your loss". Lauzon defeated Ruediger, who is a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, via armbar in 2:01 of round one having completely dominated him for the entire fight. The submission earned him a "Submission of the Night" award. According to commentator Joe Rogan, Gabe "was never in it for a second."
Lauzon faced George Sotiropoulos on November 20, 2010, at UFC 123. The fight began with an action-packed first round, that saw Lauzon set the pace. However, by the end of the round, Lauzon began to tire and saw Sotiropoulos began to gain momentum. The second round saw a fatigued and passive Joe Lauzon. After a scramble, Sotiropoulous ended up on top position and torqued a kimura to force the tap-out. Both fighters earned a "Fight of the Night" bonus award.
Lauzon faced Curt Warburton on June 26 at UFC on Versus 4. Lauzon defeated Warburton via first round kimura, which earned him a "Submission of the Night" bonus award.

Rock Springs massacre

The Rock Springs massacre, also known as the Rock Springs riot, occurred on September 2, 1885, in the present-day United States city of Rock Springs in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The riot, and resulting massacre of immigrant Chinese miners by European immigrant miners, was the result of racial prejudice toward the Chinese miners, who were accused of taking jobs from the existing miners. The Union Pacific Coal Department found it economically beneficial to give preference in hiring to Chinese miners, who were willing to work for lower wages than their European counterparts, which angered the existing miners. When the rioting ended, at least 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured. Rioters burned 78 Chinese homes, resulting in approximately $150,000 in property damage (equal to $4,800,000 in terms). Despite the identification of the perpetrators, no individuals were prosecuted for the murders or property destruction.
Tension between European and Chinese immigrants in the late 19th-century American West was particularly high, especially in the decade preceding the violence. The massacre in Rock Springs was one among several instances of violence culminating from years of anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States. The Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, but not before thousands of immigrants came to the American West. Most Chinese immigrants to Wyoming Territory took jobs with the railroad at first, but many ended up employed in coal mines owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. As Chinese immigration increased, so did anti-Chinese sentiment on the part of white Americans. The Knights of Labor, one of the foremost voices against Chinese immigrant labor, formed a chapter in Rock Springs in 1883, and most rioters were members of that organization. However, no direct connection was ever established linking the riot to the national Knights of Labor organization.
In the immediate aftermath of the riot, United States Army troops were deployed in Rock Springs. They escorted the surviving Chinese miners, most of whom had fled to Evanston, Wyoming, back to Rock Springs a week after the riot. Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. In Rock Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the event, while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for the riot was limited to sympathy for the causes of the existing miners. The massacre in Rock Springs touched off a wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the Puget Sound area of Washington Territory. It is also the worst mass shooting in Wyoming history.
Background.
Chinese immigration to the United States at that time was neither uniform nor widespread. J. R. Tucker, writing for "The North American Review" in 1884, stated that the vast majority of the nearly 100,000 Chinese immigrants resided within the American West: California, Nevada, Oregon, and the Washington Territory. The U.S. Minister to China, George Seward, had asserted similar numbers in "Scribner's Magazine" five years earlier.
The first jobs Chinese laborers took in Wyoming were on the railroad, working for the Union Pacific company (UP) as maintenance-of-way workers. Chinese workers soon became an asset to UP, working along UP lines and in UP coal mines from Laramie to Evanston. Most Chinese workers in Wyoming ended up working in Sweetwater County, but a large number settled in Carbon and Uinta counties. Most Chinese people in the area were men working in the mines. Confusion about Chinese immigrants was widespread and largely uncontroversial at the time. Tucker, in the aforementioned 1884 article, referred to Asian immigrants as "...the Asiatic race, alien in blood, habits, and civilization". He also noted, "Chinese are the chief element in this Asiatic population."
In 1874–75, after labor unrest disrupted coal production, the Union Pacific Coal Department hired Chinese laborers in their coal mines throughout southern Wyoming. The Chinese population rose slowly at first; however, where there were Chinese immigrants, they were generally concentrated in one area. At Red Desert, a remote section camp in Sweetwater County, there were 20 inhabitants, of whom 12 were Chinese. All 12 were laborers who worked under an American foreman. To the east of the Red Desert was another remote section camp, Washakie. An American section foreman lived there amongst 23 others, including 13 Chinese laborers and an Irish crew foreman. In the various section camps along the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad, Chinese workers far outnumbered other nationalities. Though the 79 Chinese in Sweetwater County in 1870 represented only 4% of the total population, they were concentrated. In Rock Springs and Green River, the largest towns along the UP line, there were no Chinese residents reported in 1870.
Throughout the 1870s, the Chinese population in Sweetwater County and all of Wyoming steadily increased. During the decade, Wyoming's total population rose from 9,118 to 20,789. In the 1870 U.S. census, what the government today calls "Asian and Pacific Islanders" represented 143 members of the population of Wyoming. The increase during the 1870s was the largest percentage increase in the Asian population of Wyoming of any decade since; the increase represented a 539% jump in the Asian population. By 1880, most Chinese residents in Sweetwater County lived in Rock Springs. At that time, Wyoming was home to 914 Asians; that number fell significantly during the 1880s to 465.
Although most Chinese workers in 1880 were employed in the coal mines around Wyoming and Sweetwater County, the Chinese in Rock Springs worked mostly in occupations outside of mining. In addition to Chinese laborers and miners, a professional gambler, a priest, a cook and a barber resided in the city. In Green River, Wyoming, there was a Chinese doctor. Chinese servants and waiters found work in Green River and in Fort Washakie. In Atlantic City, Miner's Delight, and Red Canyon, Wyoming, Chinese gold miners were employed. However, the majority of the 193 Chinese residing in Sweetwater County by 1880 worked in the coal mines or on the railroad.
Causes.
The riot was the result of a combination of racial prejudice and general resentment against Union Pacific. In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act required that "... from and after the expiration of ninety days next after the passage of this act, and until the expiration of ten years next after the passage of this act, the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States be, and the same is hereby, suspended; and during such suspension it shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come." In the years preceding the Rock Springs massacre, the importation of Chinese labor was seen as a "system worse than slavery". The white miners at Rock Springs, being mostly Cornish, Irish, Swedish, and Welsh immigrants, believed lower-paid Chinese laborers drove down their wages.
The Chinese at Rock Springs were aware of the animosity and rising racial tension with other miners, but had not taken any precautions, as no prior events indicated there would be any riots. Underlying the outbreak of violence were resentment of the policies of the Union Pacific Coal Department. Until 1875, the mines in Rock Springs were worked by European Americans; in that year, a strike occurred, and the strikers were replaced with Chinese strikebreakers less than two weeks after the strike began. The company resumed mining with 50 American miners and 150 Chinese miners in its employ. As more Chinese arrived in Rock Springs, bitterness from the legacy miners increased. At the time of the massacre, there were about 150 legacy miners and 331 Chinese miners in Rock Springs.
In the two years before the massacre, a "Whitemen's Town" was established in Rock Springs. By 1883, the Knights of Labor organized a chapter in Rock Springs. The Knights were one of the major groups which spearheaded opposition to Chinese labor during the 1880s; in 1882, the Knights had worked for the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act. No evidence has been uncovered to prove that the national Knights of Labor organization was behind the massacre at Rock Springs. In August 1885, notices were posted from Evanston to Rock Springs, demanding the expulsion of Chinese immigrants, and on the evening of September 1, 1885, one day before the violence, legacy miners in Rock Springs held a meeting about the Chinese immigrants. It was rumored that threats were made that night against the Chinese, according to immigrants then residing there.
Massacre.
Chronology.
At 7:00 a.m. on September 2, 1885, ten American men, in ordinary garb and miner's uniforms, arrived at coal pit number six at the Rock Springs mine. They declared that the Chinese laborers had no right to work in a particularly desirable "room" in the mine; miners were paid by the ton, thus location was important to the miners. A fight broke out, and two Chinese workers at pit number six were badly beaten. One of the Chinese workers later died due to his injuries. The American miners, most of whom were members of the Knights of Labor, walked out of the mine.
After the work stoppage at pit number six, more American miners assembled near the town. They marched to Rock Springs by way of the railroad, carrying firearms. At about 10:00 a.m., the bell in the Knights of Labor meeting hall tolled, and the miners inside the building joined the already large group. There were some miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob. By 2:00 p.m. the saloons and grocers were persuaded, likely by a Union Pacific official, to close.
With the saloons and grocers closed, about 150 men armed with Winchester rifles moved toward Chinatown in Rock Springs. They moved in two groups and entered Chinatown by crossing separate bridges. The larger group entered by way of the railroad bridge and was divided into squads, a few of which remained standing on the opposite side of the bridge outside Chinatown. The smaller group entered by way of the town's plank bridge.
Squads from the larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a position at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour to pack up and leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.
As the American miners moved into Chinatown, the Chinese became aware of the riot and that Leo Dye Bah and Yip Ah Marn, residents from the west and east sides of Chinatown, had already been killed. As the news of the events spread, the Chinese fled in fear and confusion. They ran in every direction: up the hill behind coal pit number three; others, along the base of the hill at coal pit number four; others still, from the eastern end of town, fled across Bitter Creek to the opposite hill; and more fled the western end of Chinatown across the base of the hill to the right of coal pit number five. The opposing group came from three directions by this time, from the east and west ends of town and from the wagon road. The Chinese immigrants present at the Rock Springs massacre presented their own grisly account of the mêlée to the Chinese consul in New York City: 
By 3:30 p.m. the massacre was well under way. A group of women in Rock Springs had gathered at the plank bridge, where they stood and cheered on the legacy miners. Two of the women reportedly fired shots at the Chinese. As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between 4 and 9 p.m., rioters set fire to the camp houses belonging to the coal company. By 9 p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire. Damage to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.
Some Chinese died on the banks of Bitter Creek as they fled; others died near the railroad bridge as they attempted to escape Chinatown. The rioters threw Chinese bodies into the flames of burning buildings. Other Chinese immigrants, who had hidden in their houses instead of fleeing, were murdered, and then their bodies were burned with their houses. Those who could not run, including the sick, were burned alive in their camp houses. Many of the Chinese who were burned in their houses apparently tried "to dig a hole in the cellar to hide themselves. However, the fire overtook them when about half way in the hole, burning their lower limbs to a crisp and leaving the upper trunk untouched." One remaining Chinese immigrant was found dead in a laundry house in Whitemen's Town, his home demolished by rioters.
The attacks at Rock Springs were extraordinarily violent. The sheer brutality of the violence startled the entire country. Besides those who were burned alive, Chinese miners were scalped, mutilated, branded, decapitated, dismembered, and hanged from gutter spouts. One of the Chinese miners' penis and testicles were cut off and toasted in a nearby saloon as a "trophy of the hunt".
There were 28 confirmed deaths, and at least 15 miners were wounded. Some sources assert that 40 to 50 fatalities might be a more accurate number, as some of those who fled were never accounted for. The Chinese consul in New York City compiled a detailed list of the massacre's victims.

Outcome.
Immediate aftermath.
In the days following the riot, surviving Chinese immigrants in Rock Springs fled and were picked up by Union Pacific trains. By September 5, almost all survivors were in Evanston, Wyoming, west of Rock Springs. Once there, they were subjected to threats of murder and other crimes; Evanston was another area in Wyoming where anti-Chinese sentiment was high.
Rumors of the return of the Chinese to Rock Springs circulated immediately after the riots. On September 3, the "Rock Springs Independent" published an editorial which confirmed the rumors of "the return", as a few Chinese began to trickle back into town to search for valuables. "The Independent" said of the return of Chinese laborers to Rock Springs, "It means that Rock Springs is killed, as far as White men are concerned, if such program is carried out." The massacre was defended in the local newspaper, and, to an extent, in other western newspapers. In general, however, Wyoming newspapers disapproved of the acts of the massacre while supporting the cause of the original miners.
Wyoming's territorial Governor Francis E. Warren visited Rock Springs on September 3, 1885, the day after the riot, to make a personal assessment. After his trip to Rock Springs, Warren traveled to Evanston, where he sent telegrams to U.S. President Grover Cleveland appealing for federal troops. Back in Rock Springs, the riot had calmed, but the situation was still unstable. Two companies of the United States Army's 7th Infantry arrived on September 5, 1885. One company, under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, was stationed in Evanston, Wyoming; the other, under a Colonel Chipman, was stationed in Rock Springs. At Camp Murray, Utah Territory, Colonel Alexander McDowell McCook was ordered to augment the garrison sent to Wyoming with six more companies.
On September 9, 1885, one week after the massacre, six companies of soldiers arrived in Wyoming. Four of the six companies then escorted the Chinese back to Rock Springs. Once back in Rock Springs, the Chinese laborers found scorched tracts of land where their homes once stood. The mining company had buried only a few dead; others remained lying in the open, mangled, decomposing, and partially eaten by dogs, hogs, or other animals.
The situation in Rock Springs was stabilized as early as September 15, when Warren first requested the removal of federal troops, but the mines at Rock Springs remained closed for a time. On September 30, 1885, White miners, mostly Finnish immigrants who were members of the Knights of Labor, walked out of mines in Carbon County, Wyoming, in protest of the company's continued use of Chinese miners. In Rock Springs, the White miners were not back at work in late September, because the company still used Chinese labor. Rock Springs steadily became quieter, and, on October 5, 1885, emergency troops, except for two companies, were removed. However, the temporary posts of Camp Medicine Butte, established in Evanston, and of Camp Pilot Butte, in Rock Springs, remained long after the riot. Camp Pilot Butte closed in 1899 after the onset of the Spanish–American War.
The labor strike was unsuccessful, and the miners went back to work within a couple of months. The national Knights of Labor organization refused to support the Carbon strike and the hold out by White miners in Rock Springs following the Rock Springs Riot. The organization avoided supporting the miners along the Union Pacific Railroad, because it did not want to be seen as condoning the violence at Rock Springs. When the Union Pacific Coal Department reopened the mines, it fired 45 White miners connected to the violence.
Arrests.
After the riot in Rock Springs, sixteen men were arrested, including Isaiah Washington, a member-elect to the territorial legislature. The men were taken to jail in Green River, where they were held until after a Sweetwater County grand jury refused to bring indictments. In explaining its decision, the grand jury declared that there was no cause for legal action, stating, in part: "We have diligently inquired into the occurrence at Rock Springs. ... [T]hough we have examined a large number of witnesses, no one has been able to testify to a single criminal act committed by any known White person that day."
Those arrested as suspects in the riot were released a little more than a month later, on October 7, 1885. On their release, they were "...met ... by several hundred men, women and children, and treated to a regular ovation", according to "The New York Times". The defendants in the Rock Springs case enjoyed the same broad community consent that lynch mobs often received. No person or persons were ever convicted in the violence at Rock Springs.
Diplomatic and political issues.
After the riot, the U.S. government hesitated to make amends to the Chinese for the massacre. In China, the governor-general of the Guangdong region suggested that Americans in China might be the target of revenge for the events in Rock Springs. The American envoy to China, Charles Harvey Denby, and others in the diplomatic corps reported rising anti-American sentiment in Hong Kong and in Canton, Guangdong, following the riot. American diplomats warned their government that the backlash from the massacre could ruin U.S. trade with China; they also reported that British merchants and newspapers in China were encouraging the Chinese to "stand up for their oppressed countrymen in America." Denby advised that U.S. Secretary of State Thomas Bayard obtain compensation for the victims of the massacre.
The United States government agreed to pay compensation for the damaged property but not for the actual victims of the massacre, although Bayard was inclined to resist the requests for payments. In a letter to the minister of China's Washington legation dated February 18, 1886, he expressed a personal view that the violence against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to cultural assimilation, and that racism against Chinese was typically found among other immigrants rather than the majority of the populace: Denby's predictions caused Bayard to seek a Congressionally appropriated indemnity. At Bayard's urging, the U.S. Congress provided US$147,748.74 as an indemnity. The compensation was made as a monetary gift and not as a legal decree of responsibility for the massacre and the outcome amounted to a minor diplomatic victory for China.
Correspondence between Wyoming's territorial Governor, Francis Warren, and Union Pacific officials during Warren's term in office indicate that he petitioned the company for years to clear the titles on land he owned. He condemned the riot as "the most brutal and damnable outrage that ever occurred in any country."
Reaction.
After the riot, rhetoric and reaction came from publications and key political figures concerning the events. "The New York Times" blasted the city of Rock Springs in the first of at least two editorials on the topic, stating, "the appropriate fate for a community of this kind would be that of Sodom and Gomorrah". In another "Times" editorial on November 10, 1885, the paper continued to assail not only the residents of Rock Springs who were involved in the violence, but those who stood by and let the mob continue its behavior. Newspapers in Wyoming, such as the "Cheyenne Tribune" and the "Laramie Boomerang", reacted with sympathy toward the white miners. The "Boomerang" stated it "regretted" the riot but found extenuating circumstances surrounding the violence.
In addition to newspapers, anti-Chinese sentiment and stereotypes came from other publications. "The Chautauquan: A Weekly Newsmagazine" characterized the Chinese as weak and defenseless, stating in its coverage of the massacre: "To murder an industrious Chinaman is the same kind of fiendish work as the murder of women and children – it is equally a violation of the rights of the defenceless."
Knights of Labor leader Terence Powderly wrote in a letter to W. W. Stone (excerpts of which he included in a report to the U.S. Congress) that, "It is not necessary for me to speak of the numerous reasons given for the opposition to this particular race – their habits, religion, customs and practices ..." Powderly blamed the "problem" of Chinese immigration on the failings of the 1882 Exclusion Act. He faulted lax law enforcement, not those involved in the riots, for the attacks at Rock Springs. Powderly wrote that the U.S. Congress should stop "winking at violations of this statute" and reform the laws which barred Chinese immigration, which he believed could have prevented incidents such as "the recent assault upon the Chinese at Rock Springs".
In December 1885, U.S. President Grover Cleveland presented his State of the Union report to Congress, and in it, his reaction to the Rock Springs massacre. Cleveland's report pointed out that the United States was interested in good relations with China. He stated, "All of the power of this government should be exhorted to maintain the amplest good faith towards China in the treatment of these men, and the inflexible sternness of the law ... must be insisted upon ... race prejudice is the chief factor to originating these disturbances".
Post-massacre violence.
The massacre at Rock Springs led to other incidents of anti-Chinese aggression, primarily in Washington Territory, though there were incidents in Oregon and other states as well. Near Newcastle, Washington a mob of Whites burned down the barracks of 36 Chinese coal miners. Throughout the Puget Sound area, Chinese workers were driven out of communities and subject to violence in Washington cities and towns, including Tacoma, Seattle, Newcastle, and Issaquah. Chinese workers were driven out of other Washington towns, but sources indicated, as early as 1891, that the above events were specifically connected to the wave of violence touched off at Rock Springs.
The wave of anti-Chinese violence in the western United States following the Rock Springs Riot spread further, to the state of Oregon. Mobs drove Chinese workers out of small towns throughout the state in late 1885 and mid-1886. Other states reported incidents as well: As far away as Augusta, Georgia, anger was expressed against the Chinese in response to the massacre at Rock Springs. According to "The New York Times", the rioting in Rock Springs fueled the desire of anti-Chinese Georgians in Augusta to air their grievances.
Significance and context.
The Rock Springs massacre was seen by observers at the time, and by historians today, as one of the worst and most significant instance of anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States. The riot received widespread media coverage from publications such as "The National Police Gazette" and "The New York Times". Among the events of anti-Chinese violence in the American west, the Rock Springs massacre is considered the most widely publicized.
Today, nearly all historians hold the view that the prime factor which contributed to the riot was race prejudice. A 1990 work on the Rock Springs massacre, written by journalist Craig Storti, marginalized the racial factor and put a stronger emphasis on the economic factors which contributed to violence. His book, "Incident at Bitter Creek: The Rock Springs Massacre", was widely criticized in reviews, though Storti stated he represented the historical record as it stood. There were labor considerations that contributed to the violence in Rock Springs, though they are generally seen as less significant. The use of Chinese workers by the railroad during an 1875 strike created widespread resentment among the White miners, which continued to build until the Rock Springs massacre. Storti's book described anti-Chinese racism as "pervasive" even while downplaying its significance to the riot. The view that the Chinese refused to assimilate into American culture was held historically and still carries some weight in present-day interpretations of the historical record.
Camp Pilot Butte was located on the north bank of Bitter Creek, in the northwest part of the city of Rock Springs. The camp covered acres of Union Pacific property; the parade ground was in the center of a present-day city block bounded by Soulsby Street on the west, Pilot Butte Avenue on the east, Bridger Avenue on the north and Elias Avenue on its south. In 1973, the area where the army post once existed was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. At that time, there were only two remaining original structures. The two buildings were owned by the Saints Cyril and Methodius Catholic Church in Rock Springs. The buildings are no longer extant, and the property is no longer listed on the National Register. The area that was once Chinatown, just north of where Camp Pilot Butte once stood, had a public elementary school built over part of it. In general, the locations in Rock Springs associated with the massacre have been surrounded and absorbed by the city's growth.

George Vernadsky

George Vernadsky (; August 20, 1887 – June 12, 1973) was a Russian-born American historian and an author of numerous books on Russian history.
European years.
Born in Saint Petersburg on August 20, 1887, Vernadsky stemmed from a respectable family of the Russian intelligentsia. His father was Vladimir Vernadsky, a famous Russian/Ukrainian geologist.
He entered the Moscow University (where his father was professor) in 1905 but, due to the disturbances of the First Russian Revolution, had to spend the next two years in Germany, at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg and the University of Berlin, where he imbibed the doctrines of Heinrich Rickert.
Back in Russia, Vernadsky resumed his course at the Moscow University, graduating with honors in 1910. His instructors included the historians Vasily Klyuchevsky and Robert Vipper. The young scholar declined to continue his career in the university after the 1910 Kasso affair and moved to Saint Petersburg University, where he taught for the next seven years, during which he was awarded the Master's degree for his dissertation on the effects of Freemasonry on the Russian Enlightenment.
Politically close to the kadet party (of which his father was one of the leaders), Vernadsky began his career as a supporter of liberal ideas, authoring the biographies of Nikolai Novikov and Pavel Milyukov. During the years of the Russian Civil War (1917–1920), he lectured for a year in Perm. He then taught in Kiev and then followed the White Army to Simferopol, where he taught at the local university for two years.
After the fall of Crimea to the Bolsheviks in 1920, Vernadsky left his native country for Istanbul, moving to Athens later that year. At the suggestion of Nikodim Kondakov, he settled in Prague, teaching there from 1921 until 1925 at the Russian School of Law. There, in association with Nikolai Trubetzkoy and P.N. Savitsky, he participated in formulating the Eurasian Theory of Russian history. After Kondakov's death, Vernadsky was in charge of the Kondakov Seminar, which disseminated his view of Russian culture as the synthesis of Slavonic, Byzantine, and nomadic influences.
American years.
In 1927, Michael Rostovtzeff and Frank A. Golder offered Vernadsky a position at Yale University in the United States. At Yale, he first served as a research associate in history (1927–1946), and then became a full professor of Russian history in 1946. He served in that position until his retirement in 1956. He died in New Haven on June 12, 1973.
Vernadsky's first book in English was a widely read textbook on Russian history, first published in 1929 and republished six times during his lifetime. It was translated to numerous languages, including Hebrew and Japanese. In 1943, he embarked on his magnum opus, "A History of Russia", of which six volumes were eventually published, despite the death of his co-author, Professor Michael Karpovich, in 1959.
Interpretation of Russian history.
Vernadsky took a novel approach to Russian history, presenting it as a continuous succession of empires, starting from the Scythian, Sarmatian, Gothic, and Hunnic; Vernadsky attempted to determine the laws of their expansion and collapse. His views emphasized the importance of Eurasian nomadic cultures for Russia's cultural and economic progress, thus anticipating some of the ideas advanced by Lev Gumilev.
Vernadsky became the leading American exponent of depicting Russia as much Asian as European, if not more so. He pointed out many substantial cultural differences between Russia and Europe and praised the success of Russian development along an independent path that revealed its unique character. Vernadsky was a geographical determinist like his Yale colleague Ellsworth Huntington. They assumed that the characteristics of a land defined the character of the people and, indeed, of their government. For that reason, Vernadsky could identify the roots of Russian culture in an ancient period long before the Slavic groups arrived. He thereby undercut the standard claim that modern Russia emerged from Kyivan Rus. He emphasized the importance of the Mongol period (1238–1471), as the horde united the vast Eurasian plain under a single ruler. This gave tsarist Russia a strong centralized government and a deep distrust of Europe. Vernadsky was annoyed that Peter the Great tried to Westernize Russia, distorting its natural character. He said Peter only succeeded in polarizing Russia into a Western-oriented elite that conflicted profoundly with the Eurasian peasants. Indeed, Vernadsky argued that this polarization was one of the main weaknesses of the tsarist regime, making it incapable of dealing with the revolutionary movements of the early twentieth century. He celebrated the collapse of the European-style parliamentary government in the October Revolution of 1917 that brought the Bolsheviks to power. Vernadsky was not a liberal, nor was he a Communist sympathizer, but he did admire the Bolsheviks for rebuilding an assertive Russia on non-European lines.
Critics.
While G. Vernadsky's writings about the historical past were based upon solid archive sources, his flight from Russia separated him from original materials of the latest periods. Thus, some critics of early editions were doubtful about certain figures and estimates he made for contemporaneousness, pointing out that some of them were rather a guess than hard evidence. After a new, edition of "A History of Russia" appeared in 1930, S.B. Clough from Columbia University reviewed it in "Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science":
Iakov Lur'e (1968) accused Vernadsky's "Kievan Russia" (1948) of uncritically recycling Tatishchev information about an alleged commercial treaty that Vladimir the Great supposedly concluded with the Volga Bulgars in 1006, which is only found in Tatishchev's second (printed) redaction of the "Istoriya Rossiyskaya", not in his first redaction, and is not known from any other source, but fits neatly with Tatishchev's own mercantilist theories. Vernadsky knew that S. L. Peshtich had written an article in 1946 arguing that there is no evidence of such a treaty, 'but [Vernadsky] neither accepted its conclusions nor refuted them in any way.' Similarly, Vernadsky wrote that 'Tatishchev's data fit well into the general historical picture' about Roman of Smolensk and Konstantin of Suzdal founding schools in the 12th and 13th centuries, even though this is only recorded in Tatishchev's second redaction, nowhere else, and seems to conveniently echo Tatishchev's Enlightenment ideas about the importance of education, rather than reflecting historical sources.

Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru

, commonly known as , is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Caramel Box and released on January 28, 2005 playable on Windows PCs. The game was later ported to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable (PSP) with the adult content removed. The Windows version was released in English by MangaGamer in 2012. The story follows the life of Mizuho Miyanokouji, an androgynous male high school student, who transfers into an all-girls school due to his grandfather's will.
The gameplay in "Otoboku" follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the six female main characters by the player character. The game ranked as the second best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Caramel Box went on to produce two fan discs released in 2005 and 2007 in "Caramel Box Yarukibako" and "Caramel Box Yarukibako 2", respectively. Caramel Box later produced a sequel to "Otoboku" titled "Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder", released on June 30, 2010 playable on Windows PCs. "Futari no Elder" was ported to the PSP with the adult content removed. The story follows Chihaya Kisakinomiya, an androgynous male, who transfers into the all-girls school that was the setting of "Otoboku". A third "Otoboku" game titled "Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Trinkle Stars" was released on February 23, 2018 playable on Windows PCs.
A manga adaptation of "Otoboku" was serialized in ASCII Media Works' "Dengeki Daioh", and a manga adaptation of "Futari no Elder" was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's "Comp Ace". Comic anthologies, light novels and art books were also published, as were audio dramas and several music albums. A 12-episode "Otoboku" anime produced by Feel aired in Japanese between October and December 2006, and an extra original video animation (OVA) episode was released in April 2007. Media Blasters licensed the anime and released the series in three DVD volumes. The "Otoboku" anime was generally panned in reviews at Anime News Network where the series was described as "cruelly unimaginative" with "obnoxious quirks and technical shortcomings". In a review of the anime by Mania Entertainment, the series is thought to be "very predictable and bland". A three-episode OVA adaptation of "Futari no Elder" produced by Silver Link was released between August and October 2012. An OVA adaptation of "Trinkle Stars" produced by EXNOA with animation by Blue Bread was released in January 2022.
Gameplay.
"Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru" is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Mizuho Miyanokouji. Its gameplay requires little player interaction as much of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. "Otoboku" follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.
There are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Each scenario is divided into eight episodes, one interlude episode and an epilogue. At the end of an episode, an announcement of the next episode appears showing a preview of what is to consist in the next episode. Each episode takes place within the span of one month between June and March from episode one through the epilogue. The interlude episode is placed between the second and third episodes.
In the adult versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Mizuho and a given heroine having sex. When the game was ported to the PlayStation 2 (PS2) console, the gameplay was somewhat altered. The PS2 version, and later the PlayStation Portable (PSP) version, both had the sexual content removed, and in these versions there is no evidence that physical relationships actually take place between any of the students.
There are ten additional sub episodes and a special sub episode. The CD and DVD Windows editions contain four sub episodes, the fan disc "Caramel Box Yarukibako" contains four sub episodes and a special episode, "Caramel Box Yarukibako 2" contains two sub episodes, and the PS2 version contains six sub episodes, though the order in which they appeared was altered.
In "Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder", the player assumes the roles of the main protagonist Chihaya Kisakinomiya and the secondary character Kaoruko Nanahara. There are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. In the adult versions of "Futari no Elder", there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Chihaya and a given heroine having sex. The gameplay is somewhat altered in the PSP version. The PSP version has the sexual content removed, the scenarios of Utano Sasou and Kaori Kamichika that appeared in the Windows version are removed, and it contains newly added scenarios of You Kashiwagi and Hatsune Minase. There are three additional sub episodes in the Windows version of "Futari no Elder".
Plot.
Setting.
The primary setting is at a private all-girls school named Seio Girls' Academy, also called Seio Jogakuin Christian Education, which was founded in 1886 by Mizuho's ancestor. Seio was originally named , which was used in original Windows version, the drama CD of the visual novel, and for the "Caramel Box Yarukibako" fan disc. This name was later ascertained to be similar to a name of an actual school, and the school's name was changed to . Seio is used in the PlayStation 2 version, DVD Windows edition, "Caramel Box Yarukibako Fukkoku-ban" and anime series. The secondary setting is at a dormitory building named , which Mizuho, Mariya, Yukari and Kana are boarding at. There are four other former dormitories named Tsubaki-yakata, Enoki-yakata, Hisagi-yakata and Hiiragi-yakata.
Main characters.
The player assumes the role of Mizuho Miyanokouji, the protagonist of "Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru". He is a kind high school student who impersonates a girl at an all-girls school, which he transfers into per his grandfather's will. He spends his time with many fellow attendees, some of which live in the nearby dormitory, and enjoys helping them with any problems they may have. His childhood friend Mariya Mikado attends the school with him, and helps in his female transition. She has a spirited personality with a bit of a temper, and has been a support for Mizuho in the past. Mizuho meets a classmate named Shion Jujo who has a silent voice and demeanor; she quickly figures out that Mizuho is actually a boy, but tells no one. The previous year, she had to be hospitalized soon after she was elected as the Elder due to an illness.
At the dormitory lives an energetic first-year student named Yukari Kamioka. She is on the track and field team along with Mariya, who is her , and has low confidence in her ability to run. Another first-year at the dormitory named Kana Suoin meets Mizuho on the day he moves in, and soon after Mizuho becomes her "Oneesama". Kana is more than happy to serve Mizuho any way she can, since she admires him immensely. A hyperactive ghost resides in Mizuho's room named Ichiko Takashima and is shown to speak very fast when excited. She says that Mizuho looks very much like her previous Elder love interest, who turns out to be Mizuho's deceased mother. The student council president at Seio is Takako Itsukushima who tends to have a serious personality.
Story.
"Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru" revolves around the main protagonist Mizuho Miyanokouji, a male high school student. After Mizuho's grandfather dies, his will is reviewed, which explains his desire to have his grandson transfer to Seio Girls' Academy, the same one his own mother attended and his ancestors founded. Abiding by the will, Mizuho cross-dresses to attend the school. The headmistress, the deputy head teacher (visual novel only), Mizuho's homeroom teacher Hisako Kajiura and Mariya Mikado initially know his secret; Shion Jujo and Ichiko Takashima also eventually find this out. Mizuho is very popular among the other students, who often talk about how pretty, nice, and athletic Mizuho is. This rampant popularity escalates to him even being nominated against his will to join in on the Elder election. By these terms, the current student council president, Takako Itsukushima, runs against Mizuho.
The Elder election is an old tradition at Seio Girls' Academy where every June one of the students is elected by her peers to be the "Elder", who is seen as the number one "Elder Sister" in the school. Until her graduation, she is referred to by her peers as . To become an Elder, a candidate must gain at least 75% of the votes. If none of the candidates get at least 75% in the first round of voting, one of the candidates hands over her votes to another candidate, and the candidate who finally obtains at least 75% of the votes becomes the Elder. If there is no one else in the election, the current year's student council president becomes the Elder. In "Otoboku", Mizuho gains 82% of the votes in the first round, effectively becoming the 72nd Elder in the school's history. After becoming Elder, Mizuho progressively gets more popular among the student body, since he is now a symbol of the school's excellence. In the following months, Mizuho starts to get to know some of the girls better and helps them with their problems.
"Futari no Elder".
"Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder" is written from the viewpoints of main character Chihaya Kisakinomiya and secondary character Kaoruko Nanahara. "Futari no Elder" begins about two years after Mizuho's graduation. The main protagonist Chihaya Mikado was truant at his school because of harassment in the school and of a distrust in men. His mother cannot bear to watch him be in trouble, so she makes him transfer to Seio Girls' Academy, her old school. He dresses as a girl and introduces himself as Chihaya Kisakinomiya. Chihaya meets another protagonist Kaoruko Nanahara, who once rescued him from a playboy, and he begins to live in the dormitory building. He becomes the focus of public attention due to his attractive face and figure, and due to high grades at studies.
In the 75th Elder election, there are four finalists; Hatsune Minase hands over her votes to Kaoruko and Makiyo Shingyouji hands over her votes to Chihaya. Then Chihaya and Kaoruko gain the same votes of 368 together. Though a candidate which gains 75% or more of the votes becomes the Elder, Hatsune, as the student council president, proposes that both Chihaya and Kaoruko become the Elders; the motion is adopted unanimously. This is the first time there have been two Elders in the history of Seio Girls' Academy.
Development.
"Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru" is the fourth visual novel developed by Caramel Box. The scenario is written by Aya Takaya, and this was the first time Takaya was staffed on a Caramel Box game. Art direction and character design is done by Norita, who was staffed on Caramel Box's debut release "Blue" as an artist. The super deformed illustrations featured in "Otoboku" were drawn by the game illustrator Yoda. The music was composed by the music team Zizz Studio.
The original title uses the kanji , which means "virgin", but is very close to the word for "young lady", "shōjo". The creators added furigana subscript to indicate they wanted it read "otome" meaning "young maiden". Additionally, furigana was added above to indicate that they wanted it read "boku". Despite the different kanji, the official reading is "Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru". When the game was ported to the PlayStation 2, it was rewritten as with the same pronunciation of "Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru", which uses the actual kanji. The latter name was kept for the manga and anime releases.

The English version of the original visual novel by MangaGamer was reviewed by Nicholas E. Mendes of NookGaming, who felt it had not aged well in some aspects, but was positive about the drama and comedy. In particular, he was surprised about the lack of dependency on tropes, despite having several characters that could easily fit into one.
The first two anime DVD volumes released by Media Blasters were reviewed by Anime News Network. In the review of the first DVD, the reviewer Carl Kimlinger generally panned the volume, commenting how the three episodes were "cruelly unimaginative" where "afterwards it's one long slide into a torturous hell of girls' school tripe where not even humor or romance can pierce the veil of pain." The Catholic girls' school premise is likened to "Maria-sama ga Miteru" and "Strawberry Panic!", and is considered to be used "merely as visual spice". For the second DVD volume, Kimlinger wrote that "while the onslaught of squealing, caffeinated moe-bait has abated somewhat in its ferocity, a sagging of the already listlessly undirected plot ensures that the series' sophomore outing is only marginally more tolerable than the first." Further, the series is described as having "obnoxious quirks and technical shortcomings".
The first two anime DVD volumes released by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania Entertainment. In the review of the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge felt the anime reminded him of "parts of "Princess Princess", especially when it came to the Elder status piece. It's even reminiscent of "Strawberry Panic" in this way." The series is described as "all about the "moe" factor, bringing about an atmosphere that makes you like the characters, care about them and feel good about seeing them interact. It does it well even if it doesn't have an amazing hook." For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that the series continues to be "very predictable and bland" which is "at this point fun but entirely forgettable". Beveridge also wrote how "the characters are all pleasant, nicely designed and with mildly interesting personalities that could lead to something more but never does."

Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini

The Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini () was a Bangladeshi paramilitary force formed in 1972 by the Sheikh Mujibur Rahman government. Initially formed to curb an insurgency and maintain law and order, the force became involved in numerous charges of human rights abuses, including political killings, shooting by death squads, and rape. It was seen as the armed wing of the ruling Awami League and it swore an oath of loyalty to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
The Rakkhi Bahini has been condemned by many academics and journalists, including Ghulam Murshid who compared it with the Gestapo, and Anthony Mascarenhas who said that it was a "gang of hoodlums little different from the Nazi Brown shirts." Human Rights Watch states that the institutionalized violence committed by the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini, established the culture of impunity with which security forces in independent Bangladesh continue to abuse human rights. Pro Awami League commentators dismiss the charges as "myths".
History.
Background.
After the end of the Bangladesh Liberation War, there was a violent insurgency to replace the elected revolutionary government of the newly independent country with a Marxist communist system of government inspired by Soviet Union and Chinese Communist Party through the uses of private militias formed by left wing army commanders who fought in the war like Colonel Abu Taher and political activists many of whom were members of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal.
During the Liberation War of Bangladesh, numerous civilians joined the war after being trained by the Indian forces. Tajuddin Ahmed felt these people should come under national service as they had arms and training. Tajuddin Ahmed asked Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to form a para-military force for them.
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman primarily rejected the proposal but soon realized the necessity of an elite force, because many police officers died in the Bangladesh Liberation War. Whenever rebels attacked them in their office, they were outnumbered. Raw materials, machinery and goods of factories were being smuggled through the border to India which also became a headache for the newly formed government. Considering this situation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman decided to form this force.
"Time" remarked after independence that "Many of the more radical young guerrillas who fought with the Mukti Bahini may not be content with the moderate course charted by the middle-aged politicians of the Awami League. Moreover, the present Dacca government is a very remote power in country villages where the local cadres of the Mukti Bahini are highly visible." The article also quoted one of its commanders, Ali Ashraf Chowdhury: "We will never lay down our arms until our social ideals have been realized". he said. The article continues, "So far the Mujib Bahini has done a commendable job of protecting the Biharis, the non-Bengali Moslems who earned Bengali wrath by siding with the Pakistani army. But the government is anxious to disarm the Mujib Bahini, and has plans to organize it into a constabulary that would carry out both police and militia duties."
Masudul Haque in his book, "Bangladesher Swadhinota Juddho O CIA" ("Liberation War of Bangladesh and CIA"), mentions Abdur Rajjak, a young leader and the chief of Bangladesh Swecchasebok League (Bangladesh Volunteer's League) that Mujib told them not to surrender all the guns.
Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini was actively deployed just after the Indian Army left Bangladesh on 17 March. The force was trained and brought up by Major General Sujan Singh Uban from Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) as per the request of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Moidul Hassan, confirmed this information in the book "Muktijuddher Purbapor". Moidul Hassan wrote, 
However, this is at least partially inaccurate as Pakistani President Bhutto did not release Sheikh Mujibur Rahman "without any condition". Indeed, at the direction of Indira Gandhi, who was desperate to keep Sheikh Mujibur Rahman alive and to free him, some 90,000 Pakistani POWs (including thousands of women and children civilians) were housed in comfort and released without extradition or charges despite massive and manifest human rights violations against both Bengali Muslims and Hindus during the War of Liberation. In Savar camp there was three additional battalions who were called Recruit Battalion. These three battalions were directly supervised by Major Bala Reddy. Anwar-ul-Alam admitted that there were many Junior Commissioned Officers of Indian Army in the training camp of Savar.
Formation.
On 3 January 1972, naming prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed as the chairman, the Bangladesh government announced the names of the ten members of the Central Regulating Board of the National Militia. The members were:
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, wanted to merge with the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini, with the Bangladesh Rifles but the Bangladesh Rifles personnel stiffly opposed the move in a commotion that resulted in a mutiny. This plan was then abandoned.
The Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini Order (President's order No. 21) of 1972 provided for the establishment of the force and set out its responsibilities and powers. The presidential order, published on 7 March, was retroactive to 1 February.
Political opponents of the Awami League allege that the Rakkhi Bahini was made to replace the army. The Rakkhi Bahini had automatic weapons, steel helmets, jeeps, trucks etc. The Awami League government seemed to be more interested in the development of the militia than in the armed forces. It was planned that this militia would be increased annually so that by the end of 1980 its strength would be 20 000. On the other hand, Bangladesh Army was poorly equipped. In winter they had to guard the border in slippers.
The Rakkhi Bahini was distrusted by the defence services in Bangladesh because of its pro-Indian orientation. This was so for several reasons. First, most of the members of the armed forces who fought during the War of Independence strongly believed that the Indian Army just walked in at the end of Bangladesh Liberation War thereby robbing the Bangladesh military of the "glory of liberating their motherland." Second, many senior military officers believed that the government-in-exile at Mujibnagar signed a secret treaty with the Indian government, compromising the sovereignty of Bangladesh and that Sheikh Mujib became less interested in the development of the defence forces because of that treaty. Third, many senior army personnel felt that the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini was planned and designed by the Indian Army for the safety of the Awami League regime. The poorly equipped defence services were also bitter about the fact that the Indian Army took away all the sophisticated weapons left by the Pakistan Army.
Mascarenhas also records the statement of Major General Abul Manzoor, that numerous military personnel were killed by Rakkhi Bahini terming them as Razakars or collaborators. Despite the indignation, from July 1973 to July 1974, the army conducted a number of combined military operations with the Rakkhi Bahini and the police such as checking for smuggling at the border, handling 'extremists', and maintaining law and order.
The Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini (Amendment) Act of 1974 added two new articles, 8A and 16A, to the act, effective retroactively to 1 February 1972. Article 8A granted officers of the Rakkhi Bahini the power to arrest without warrant any person they reasonably suspect of having committed a cognizable offence under any law. This is similar to the power of police officers. The article further states that anyone arrested by the Rakkhi Bahini shall be delivered forthwith to the nearest police station. It also gives officers the right of search and seizure in connection with any reasonable suspicion that an offence has been committed.
Article 3 of the act says,
After the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
When Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed on 15 August 1975 by members of the Bangladesh Army, the Rakkhi Bahini was very inactive.
After the coup, members of Rakkhi Bahini who were deployed all around the country escaped from their camps and houses in fear of mob-violence, as the people were very angry with them.
After the death of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the force was absorbed in Bangladesh Army after the "Jatiyo Rokkhi Bahini Absorption Act, 1975 came into effect. It was issued on 9 October 1975 and was in effect from 3 September 1975.
The director general of the force Brigadier Nuruzzaman was appointed as an ambassador after the force was absorbed.
Organization.
Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini had a complete table of organization which was circulated on 8 March 1972 by a gazette notification. The chief of the force was known as director general. His five deputies were known as Deputy Director General. In reality, the Rakkhi Bahini was under the direct control of the prime minister's office and attached to the local Awami League units. In time, the government planned to place each unit under the command of a district governor. The Rakkhi Bahini also swore an oath of loyalty to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
Brigadier A. N. M. Nuruzzaman was appointed as the director general while Major Anwar Ul Alam Shahid (deputy director, Training), Lieutenant Colonel Abul Hasan Khan (deputy director, administration), Lieutenant Colonel Sarwar (deputy director, operations), Lieutenant Colonel Sabihuddin Ahmed (deputy director, signals), Lieutenant Colonel Azizul Islam (deputy director, Zonal Headquarters of Chittagong) and Lieutenant Colonel A M Khan (deputy director, medical) were his six deputies. The bulk of the Rakkhi Bahini personnel were recruited from the Mujib Bahini, a militia force that was formed during the concluding part of Liberation War and was under direct Indian supervision.
The basic training of the force officers candidates were given in Indian Military Academy, and at Savar camp, under the supervision of Indian military officer named Major Bala Reddy. Any other additional courses, special courses were also provided by Indian Army, at the Indian Military Academy of Dehradun.
Some additional land and properties were also given to this force by the government. The zonal headquarters building in the Bhatiary of Chittagong and lands in Giltala of Khulna, Bateshwar of Sylhet, Bogra and in Mirpur of Dhaka. 
During its first days as it was formed as an auxiliary of Police, it helped police to guard the office. When police failed to control the situation, they were deployed. At least 44 offices and residents of police were attacked and looted from June to December 1973. So the government deployed Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini within September of the year. JASAD challenged the government's activities and started to gain huge popularity especially among the students and youths. And many other secret organizations emerged and gained popularity as the government was failing to solve almost every issue.
Human rights abuses.
The Rakkhi Bahini committed various human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killing, forced disappearances, shooting by death squads, and rape. Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal claims that over 60,000 of its members were killed. The most conservative estimates put the death toll at over 2000. Syed Badrul Ahsan dismisses these claims as "myths."
Anthony Mascarenhas describes the activities of Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini in his book "Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood," he writes:
The Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini, which roughly translated means National Security Force, was an elite para-military force whose members had to take oaths of personal loyalty to Mujib. Despite its high-sounding name, it was a sort of private army of bully boys not far removed from Nazi Brown shirts.
Mascarenhas adds that by the end of 1973 the total of politically motivated murders in Bangladesh had crossed the 2000 mark. The victims included some members of Parliament and many of the murders were resulted of intra-party conflicts within Awami League.
Within three years, political killings by Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini reached about 30,000. This included numerous Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal members.
Even the capital Dhaka was not immune to the violence. An unofficial curfew was introduced after midnight. Almost every rickshaw, taxi and private car was checked and searched by Rokkhi Bahini personnel.
1974 famine.
When the famine started, millions of people came to the capital from villages in search of food. The government decided to drive the poor and have-nots out of the capital as it was embarrassed in front of international community with the famine. On 3 January Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini was deployed to 'Clean Dhaka' depriving the poor-beggars and the destitute from the city. In this operation about 0.2 million have-nots and slum dwellers were taken away from the capital and were forced either to return to their villages or to be moved to the three camps. The camps were hastily laid out several miles from the city. Condition of the camps was disastrous.
Amongst the three camps, the camp of Demra was the most appalling one, in where Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini gathered about 50,000 people. Those people were ill-treated and sometimes they felt that death is a better solution.
Al Mahmud did not listen to the government and tried to publish the accurate news. When the government came to know that, they sent three trucks full of Police and Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini personnel to seize the office and press of 'Gonokontho' at night and arrested the Editor Al Mahmud along with seven workers of the press.
Crackdowns on JaSaD.
1974 Ramna massacre.
Jasad, frequently tortured by JRB, decided to hold a rally on 17 March at Paltan. They also made a plan to surround the residence of Home Minister Muhammad Mansur Ali on the same day after the rally.
On 17 March 1975, agitated Jasad supporters tried to set up a barricade in front of the residence of the Home Minister Muhammad Mansur Ali after the rally. But prepared JRB personnel started firing indiscriminately upon the crowd leaving several people dead on the spot.
A notable occurrence occurred on 17 March 1975. Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini set up fire on the headquarters of JASAD on 14 March 1975. JASAD decided to form a rally towards Home Minister Mansoor Ali's house and surround it as a counter to that incident on 17 March.
The rally that started from Paltan was forwarding to the Home Minister's house but the Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini opened brush-fire and at least 50 JASAD activists were killed on the spot.
During the regime of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman thousands of youths were killed due to the suspicion of having connection with JASAD by Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini.
Among them a leader of Bangladesh Krishok League central committee and a teacher of Nawabganj High School Siddiqur Rahman Khan was killed on 10 October 1972. On 17 September 1973 JASAD Student's League leader Bablu, Robi, Ebadat Ali, Motaleb, Kalu and many other were killed in daylight by Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini.
Notable victims include: General Secretary of City College Students' Union Jahangir, student of Jahangir Nagar University Shah Borhan Uddin Rokon, student of BUET Nikhil Chandra Saha; Narshingdi JASAD leader Alauddin; JASAD leader from Gazipur Akram, Joinal, Shamsu, Badal, Anwar; Manikganj JASAD leader Shahadat Hossain Badal, Delwar Hossain Haraj, Abdul Awal Naju, Najim; activists from Jamalpur Giasuddin Master; JASAD activist Abdur Rashid, Hasu Miah; leader from Mymensingh Masuduzzaman, Abdul Jabbar; Madaripur JASAD activist Jahngir, Saddam, Ali Hosen, Mofijur; Faridpur's Kamaluzzaman, Abdul Hakim; Moniddin Ahmed, Salam Master, Rafique Uddin from Razshahi; Ata, Ranju, Manik Das Gupta, Tota, Colonel Rana, Khalil, Rajjak of Bagura; Natore's JASAD leader Nasiruddin; leader from Pabna Ashfaqur Rahman Kalu.
Execution of Siraj Sikder.
Siraj Sikder was a freedom fighter. He was educated in EPUET, now which is known as BUET. After the liberation war he started his mission to establish a socialist society. During the liberation war on 3 June he established the political party "Purba Bangla Sharbahara Party". On the first congress of the party he was elected as the party's president on 14 January 1972. He started working as the President of the party. In 1973, he was elected as the President of an alliance of eleven peoples' organization named as "Purba Banglar Jatyo Mukti Front" (National Liberation Front of East Bengal). But analyzing political situation of the country which was named as "One Party Democracy" by Guardian and the increasing torture over his party members forced him to choose the way of revolution.
On 28 December 1974, the government announced the first ever state of emergency in the history of Bangladesh to arrest all the terrorists and opposition leaders. From then Sikder was being treated as an outlaw by the law and enforcement forces. He went underground after the promulgation of emergency. A Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini commander later denied that the murder of Sikder was committed by his force.
Other incidents.
Aruna Sen the wife of politician Shanti Sen, was detained by the Jatiya Rokkhi Bahini, along with her relative Chanchal Sen. She was subjected to torture while in captivity. Aruna Sen published a statement regarding her captivity in the 17 March edition of Weekly Holiday and in the June edition of Monthly Sangskriti in 1974. After Aruna Sen was detained, a writ was filed at Supreme Court. The court asked Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini to present her in front of the court and prove her detention legal. They presented her but failed to support the legality of the detention.
Shahjahan was an 18-year-old boy from what is now Naria Upazila of Faridpur District. He was arrested in Dhaka on 28 December 1973 and handed over to the Rakkhi Bahini at their request. He was not seen again after 2 January 1974, when his brother said he saw him in custody at Rakkhi Bahini headquarters. His brother petitioned the court for a writ of "habeas corpus", challenging the legality of Shahjahan's detention. The Rakkhi Bahini responded that Shahjahan had escaped on 29 December, so was not in detention and could not be brought to the court. On cross examination, officers said the organization followed no regulations or procedure. They kept no records of their searches, seizures, arrests, or other activities. Former prime minister Moudud Ahmed believes that because Shahjahan allegedly belonged to the student wing of the Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal, an opposition political party, the Rakkhi Bahini killed him and secretly disposed of his body. Without evidence, however, the Rakkhi Bahini could not be held to account.
The court held that the Rakkhi Bahini version of events was "a pure concoction" that "demonstrates complete disregard of the law of the country." In May 1974, Justice Debesh Bhattacharya, condemned the organization in his verdict, stating:
The court urged the government to hold an enquiry into the whereabouts of Shahjahan, but none was ever undertaken.
Ayesha Faiz is the widow of Faizur Rahman and the mother of novelists Humayun Ahmed and Muhammad Zafar Iqbal. A house in Babar Road of Mohammadpur was allotted to her by the government for her husband. But just after three days she was kicked out of the house with her family by a Subedar Major of Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini. She detailed the incident in her biography "Jibon Je Rokom" ("Life as it is"). Ayesha Faiz left the home with her children. She later recalled: "Once I was made refugee by the Pakistan Army of occupation. The second time it was done by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini.
Legacy.
Human rights abuse.
Human Rights Watch states that institutionalized violence committed by the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini, established the culture of impunity and widespread prevalence of abuses by security forces in independent Bangladesh. Pro-Awami columnist Syed Badrul Ahsan defends its actions, but acknowledges "it would have been more effective and effectual, more properly indoctrinated in the spirit of the 1971 war, history would have been different."

Combermere Abbey

Combermere Abbey is a former monastery, later a country house, near Burleydam, between Nantwich, Cheshire and Whitchurch in Shropshire, England, located within Cheshire and near the border with Shropshire. Initially Savigniac and later Cistercian, the abbey was founded in the 1130s by Hugh Malbank, Baron of Nantwich, and was also associated with Ranulf de Gernons, Earl of Chester. The abbey initially flourished, but by 1275 was sufficiently deeply in debt to be removed from the abbot's management. From that date until its dissolution in 1538, it was frequently in royal custody, and acquired a reputation for poor discipline and violent disputes with both lay people and other abbeys. It was the third largest monastic establishment in Cheshire, based on net income in 1535.
After the dissolution it was acquired by Sir George Cotton, who demolished the church and most of the buildings, and converted part of the abbey into a country house. The house was remodelled in 1563 by Sir George's son, Richard Cotton, altered in 1795 by Sir Robert Cotton, and Gothicised in 1814–21 by Stapleton Cotton, Viscount Combermere. It remained in the Cotton family until 1919, and is still in private ownership.
The abbey is listed at grade I, with its North Wing now operating as a bed and breakfast. Its park includes the large lake of Comber Mere, a Site of Special Scientific Interest. A total of around of the park are listed at grade II; several structures are also listed, including a game larder at grade II*.
Toponymy.
The name Combermere means "lake of the Cumbri" – from "Cymru", the native Welsh name for Wales – and refers to an enclave of Britons surviving the Anglo-Saxon conquest of the area.
History of the abbey.
Foundation and early years.
Combermere Abbey was the earlier of the two great Cistercian abbeys in Cheshire, the other being Vale Royal. The abbey was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Saint Michael, and originally belonged to the Savigniac order, which merged with the Cistercian order by 1147. Hugh Malbank, the second Baron of Wich Malbank (now Nantwich), was the founder, and the original donation occurred early in the 12th century. It was confirmed in 1130 by Ranulf de Gernons (also Ranulf II), the fourth Earl of Chester, who was one of the witnesses of its foundation charter. Other witnesses included Hugh Malbank's son, William, and Roger de Clinton, the Bishop of Coventry. Building of the abbey commenced slightly later, possibly in 1133, often stated as the date of foundation. The site given for the monastery buildings was a wooded area by the large lake of Comber Mere, a peaceful and isolated location near the Shropshire border, suitable for the austere Savigniac order. Little or nothing is known of the early abbey buildings. The first abbot was named William.
A copy of the foundation charter survives. The original grant included the manor of Wilkesley, comprising two Domesday manors worth 18 shillings pre-Conquest; the villages of Dodcott, Lodmore and Royal; land at Burleydam; a mill and fishery at Chorley; and woods at Brentwood, Light Birchwood and Butterley Heyes. It also included a quarter of Nantwich, the largest salt producer in the county until the 17th century, with a tithe of the barony's salt revenues. The abbey was also given the church at Acton and its associated chapel of Nantwich, as well as two churches in Staffordshire, at Sandon and Alstonfield. The abbey later appropriated the church of Child's Ercall in Shropshire and the Cheshire churches and chapels of Baddiley, Church Coppenhall, Church Minshull and Wrenbury. Numerous other grants of land followed in the 12th and early 13th centuries, mainly in the south of Cheshire and the adjacent counties of Staffordshire and Shropshire, but also in Derbyshire. Other benefactors included William Malbank, who confirmed his father's grant and added further land, Robert de Ferrers, the Earl of Derby, William FitzAlan, William FitzRanulph and Ivo Pantulf, and later Ranulph de Blondeville (also Ranulph III), the Earl of Chester, Roger of Ightfield, Gilbert de Macclesfield, James de Audley and Robert de Baskerville.
The early history of Combermere is obscure as most of its records were destroyed before the 17th century. For the first hundred or so years after its foundation, the abbey appears to have been reasonably prosperous. In 1146–53, Abbot William successfully founded a daughter house at Poulton, which was endowed by Robert Pincerna (also Robert the Butler); it later moved to a site near Leek, Staffordshire, becoming Dieulacres Abbey. Both Combermere and Poulton are mentioned in about 1195 as Cistercian foundations in the area surrounding Chester. Several other daughter houses followed. Stanlow Abbey on the Wirral Peninsula was founded in 1178 by John FitzRichard, Baron of Halton, later moving to Whalley Abbey in Lancashire, and in 1219, a small daughter house was founded at Hulton in Staffordshire by Henry de Audley. In 1220, the abbot was reprimanded for unauthorised building, but an inspection by Abbot Stephen of Lexington in 1231 found no particular problems with the abbey. Combermere received a royal visit in 1245, and at that time the abbey was granted a market and fair at what is now known as Market Drayton in Shropshire.
Combermere established granges before 1237 at nearby Acton and Burland, Wincle in east Cheshire, and Cliff and Shifford in Shropshire. Wincle was a particularly large holding of pastureland in Macclesfield Forest, given by Ranulf de Blondeville. By the end of the 13th century, Chesthill, Ditchley, Dodcott, Newton, Smeaton, Wilkesley (Heyfields) and Yarlet were also included among its granges. The abbey is known to have been farming sheep by the mid-13th century, earlier than the other major Cheshire monasteries. Combermere was producing six sacks of wool annually, worth 10–21 marks per sack, which were being sold at the fair at Boston in Lincolnshire, and also exported abroad. These figures are, however, much lower than monasteries in neighbouring counties.
Decline.
The mid-13th century saw the start of the abbey's decline, with a succession of financial problems and scandals. In 1253, its creditors were prevented from seizing its flocks, if the debt could be settled by another means. In 1275, the abbey's debts were so great that its management was assigned to the Lord Chancellor and Bishop of Bath and Wells, Robert Burnell, and the following year it was placed under royal protection for two years. Edward I's war against Wales of 1282–83 drew heavily on Cheshire and placed additional strain on the monastery; it ran so low on food stores in 1283 that it was exempted from providing supplies for the army and once again removed from the abbot's management. Burnell contributed £213 towards the abbey's needs – a sum considerably in excess of its annual income, estimated in 1318 at £130 14"s" 11"d" – receiving lands in Monks Coppenhall (now Crewe) in return. Royal custody was renewed in 1315–21, from 1328, and again from 1412; the 15th-century custodians included Henry Beaufort, the Bishop of Winchester. The abbey's impoverished state persisted throughout the 14th and 15th centuries; in 1496, it was exempted from tax for this reason.
The reasons for the abbey's abrupt descent into debt are unclear. The monks and abbot attributed their situation in 1328 to financial mismanagement by earlier abbots, who had leased out many of the abbey's estates to tenants, often at poor terms. Local historian Frank Latham has speculated that the abbey's proximity to the Chester–Shrewsbury road proved an intolerable drain on its resources:the abbey was one of four to complain to Edward, the Black Prince in 1351 about the cost of providing hospitality to guests and their servants, horses and hunting hounds. In the early 15th century, previous abbots were again blamed for the abbey's poverty, this time for disposing of timber from the abbey's woods and allowing its buildings to fall into disrepair.
The abbots and monks were involved in many violent disputes with outsiders from the 13th century onwards. In 1281, a feud with the Abbey of Saint-Evroul in Orne over the church at Drayton, which Combermere was leasing from the French abbey, culminated in a group of monks, including the abbot, being excommunicated for guarding the church "like a castle" and stopping the Archbishop of Canterbury from entering. In 1309, a dispute between Richard of Fullshurst and the abbot had to be mediated by Edward II. The abbot was twice assaulted, and Fullshurst led two raids on the abbey, murdering the prior, burning buildings, stealing goods and laying ambushes to prevent the abbot's return. The attacks were repeated in 1344, leading to the abbot's ejection, while in 1360, it was the abbot who was accused of retaliating against Sir Robert Fullshurst. In 1365, long-standing tensions with the abbey's daughter house at Whalley escalated into Combermere occupying the Lancashire abbey, and attempting to eject its abbot. Several conflicts between the abbey and its tenants were recorded in the 15th century, with the most serious incident being the murder of Abbot Richard Alderwas in 1446 by John Bagh of Dodcot, a labourer, who shot the abbot with a bow and arrow.
The Black Death pandemic of 1348–49 is likely to have affected Combermere. The abbey's numbers are known for the first time in 1379, when there were nine monks, plus the abbot. Discipline appears to have broken down and the abbey had an unsavoury reputation, which it retained up until its dissolution. One monk was accused of theft in 1385, and later described as being "vagabond, apostate and obdurate". In 1414, Abbot William Plymouth was accused of forging gold coins; he had been demoted by 1418. There seem to have been internal power struggles around this time: two monks, Roger Hoggeson of Holyhurst and Richard Tenche of Lodmore, were accused of various crimes, including forcibly taking over the abbey and making off with books worth £100; although the two were acquitted, Hoggeson and another monk were later outlawed. In 1520, a monk was murdered by a servant of Abbot Christopher Walley; the prior was accused of covering up the murder and sheltering the murderer, because of the abbey's "evil name for using of misrule."
Shortly before its dissolution, Combermere had a brief period of salt production. John Leland records in around 1535 that part of a wooded hill about a mile from the abbey subsided into a salt pit, and the abbot started to make salt; however, objections from the local salt industry soon put a stop to the practice. Production appears to have restarted after the dissolution, but largely ceased during Elizabeth I's reign.
Dissolution.
The abbey's revenues in the "Valor Ecclesiasticus" of 1535 amounted to £258 6"s" 6"d", including £15 3"s" 4"d" of salt revenues from Nantwich. The net income was £225 9"s" 7"d", after expenses including rent, charitable donations and payments to a steward, an auditor and several bailiffs. This net income placed it as the third wealthiest monastic establishment in Cheshire, after St Werburgh's Abbey in Chester (£1030) and Vale Royal Abbey (£518). Combermere received its visitation from Thomas Cromwell's commissioners, Richard Layton and Thomas Legh, in February 1536, at which time its debts were assessed at £160. As with the other Cheshire abbeys, Combermere leased many properties on very long leases during its last few years, several within its final months.
The last abbot, John Massey, seems not to have contested the dissolution particularly vigorously. He visited London in May 1538, bearing a letter of support from Rowland Lee, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, but his visit was to no avail. The abbey was dissolved by Layton on 27 July 1538 (1539 in some sources). Combermere then had twelve monks, plus the abbot, an increase on the 14th-century numbers. It held 22,000 acres () of land in Cheshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire and Derbyshire. Massey received a pension of £50 per annum (which he was still taking in 1563), and the monks also received pensions.
In August 1539, the abbey and its estates, which had been revalued at £275 17"s" 11"d", were granted to Sir George Cotton, an esquire of the body to Henry VIII, and his wife, Mary. The abbey site at that time included a church with a steeple or bell-tower, and a cemetery.
History of the country house.
16th–18th centuries.
After the abbey's dissolution, the church and part of the monastery buildings were demolished. A building in the west range, usually now considered to represent the Abbot's House, was converted into a country house for the Cotton family. The hammerbeam roof timbers of the Great Hall have recently been dated to 1502, confirming the incorporation of a monastic building. Sir George's son, Richard Cotton, redesigned the house in 1563. His remodelling is commemorated by a stone tablet, uncovered in 1795, which reads:
The abbey under his ownership is the subject of what is believed to be the earliest country house poem, "To Richard Cotton, Esq.," composed by Geoffrey Whitney in 1586. It compares the abbey to a beehive:
Richard Cotton's alterations to the Great Hall (now the library) are thought to include concealing the hammerbeam roof with a plaster ceiling and putting in a fireplace. Timbers in one of the bedrooms have been dated to around this time. It is unclear whether he installed a grand staircase to access the Hall, which is on the first floor. The room's existing screen is believed to date from somewhat later; it is known to have been moved at some point from its original northern position to the south side of the Hall, where it now stands. William III stayed at the house in 1690, while travelling to the Battle of the Boyne, and his visit may have been the cause of internal reorganisation. The room where the king is thought to have slept, known as the Orange Bedroom, is adjacent to the Great Hall; its timbers have been dated to 1546–81. There is also evidence for building work in around 1725.
The house during this period is known mainly from two 18th-century pictures. The earliest, an engraving by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck dating from 1727, shows the east face, formerly the monastery's cloisters, arcades from which are still present attached to the centre of the façade. The second is an oil painting of around 1730, which depicts an aerial view of the house and gardens, including the west face of the house, then the entrance front. The ground floor is partly stone, with half-timbering in a herringbone pattern on the first storey, and three gables above forming attics. The roof is topped by a cupola above the entrance, both slightly off-central. The entrance (west) face has paired projecting gabled wings, and another wing projects at the rear.
Samuel Johnson stayed at the abbey in July 1774 with Hester Thrale, who was related to the Cottons. He writes:
The house appears to have remained little altered from its 16th-century form when Johnson visited, possibly in part because the Cottons had acquired by marriage the much larger property of Lleweni Hall in Denbighshire, Wales. Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton moved to Combermere Abbey in 1773, and later sold Lleweni. He remodelled and extended the abbey in around 1795, perhaps to his own designs; Robert Mylne was employed at this time.
Stapleton Cotton's alterations.
The existing abbey largely owes its appearance to the alterations of diplomat and military leader, Sir Stapleton Cotton. He was created Baron Combermere in 1814 (later Viscount Combermere) and awarded an annual pension of £2,000 for his service during the Napoleonic Wars. Between 1814 and 1821, he faced the house with cement render and added Gothic ornamentation, including castellations and pointed arches surrounding the windows. The rendering was put on timber battens, which were fixed "like stage scenery" to the original timber frame. A large service wing with bedrooms was thrown out to the south, and a north wing including a dining room, known as Wellington's Wing, was also built to mark Wellington's visit to the house in 1820. On the interior, he redesigned the library. In 1821, a visitor described the house as "recently coated and ornamented in the pointed Gothic style." The first Viscount Combermere is said to have been the model for W. M. Thackeray's Sir George Tufto in "The Book of Snobs", and architectural historians Peter de Figueiredo and Julian Treuherz consider his alterations to "exhibit a love of empty-headed show."
The first viscount later commissioned two projects to remodel the abbey completely; the first, of around 1829, employed Irish architects Sir Richard and William Vitruvius Morrison, and the second, Edward Blore. Neither were carried out, although the Morrisons built Stone Lodge and probably some service buildings, while Blore designed the stable block. Further alterations in 1854 included constructing a long entrance hall (since partly demolished), which protruded from the east face. Restoration work was carried out by John Tarring in 1860. The first viscount died in 1865, and 25 years later, a monumental obelisk was erected in his memory on the edge of the park, under the terms of his widow's will.
Late 19th and early 20th centuries.
His son, Wellington Stapleton-Cotton, 2nd Viscount Combermere, did some further work on the house in the 1870s, but the family's fortunes declined in the later 19th century. The second Viscount twice rented the abbey to the Empress Elisabeth of Austria in 1881 and 1882. A total of £10,000-worth of alterations were made for her stays, including installing hot water and an electric bell system; the costs were met by the Emperor. A keen huntswoman, the Empress's 80-strong retinue included 25 grooms, and she hunted frequently with the Cheshire Hunt.
The second viscount died in 1891. While his funeral was taking place, Sybell Corbet, Lady Combermere's sister, took a photograph in the abbey's library that became famous as "Lord Combermere's Ghost Photo", said to show his ghost sitting in a chair. Parapsychologist Sir William Barrett, who investigated the photograph in 1895, surmised that the "ghost" was a servant, but the late viscount's daughter-in-law stated that the male servants in the house were all much younger in appearance and the outside servants were attending the funeral.
Robert Stapleton-Cotton, 3rd Viscount Combermere led a "rackety life" and further eroded the family's wealth; he tried without success to sell the estate in 1893. Katherine, Duchess of Westminster leased the abbey in 1898–1917. In 1919, Francis Stapleton-Cotton, 4th Viscount Combermere sold Combermere Abbey and part of the estate to Sir Kenneth Crossley of Crossley Motors. An aircraft enthusiast, Sir Kenneth often flew his Tiger Moth from the estate. During the Second World War, the house was used as a hospital and school, and the Wrenbury Home Guard – of which Sir Kenneth was a member – did fieldcraft training exercises in the park. His only son, writer and MP Anthony Crossley, had been killed in an aeroplane crash shortly before the war, and when Sir Kenneth died in 1957, the estate passed to his granddaughter, Penelope Callander, later Lady Lindsay.
Reduction and restoration.
The 19th-century rendering led to problems with dry rot. By the early 1970s the house had become so dilapidated that Raymond Erith and Quinlan Terry proposed the radical solution of rebuilding it entirely. This was rejected but maintenance problems eventually led to work carried out by A. H. Brotherton in 1975, including the demolition of Wellington's Wing and part of the 19th-century south wing, and reduction of the remainder of the south wing to two storeys. The present owner (as of 2013), Lady Lindsay's daughter, Sarah Callander Beckett, took over the estate in 1992.
Combermere Abbey was entered on English Heritage's "Buildings at Risk" register in 1998, when it was first compiled. The abbey is partially occupied. Restoration work in 2010–12, supervised by Andrew Arrol and funded by grants from English Heritage and the Heritage Conservation Trust, has focused on the library, after structural problems were discovered in the east wall. As of 2013, the empty north wing is described as in a "parlous condition" and assessed as "very bad," the most at risk grade. Based on an inspection in May 2012, English Heritage fears that the north wing is in considerable danger of falling down, which would be likely to seriously damage the oldest parts of the abbey. The north wing has been protected since around 2001 by scaffolding bearing a roof, which has slowed but not halted its deterioration. The repair work necessary has been estimated as costing £2 million.
Attempts to gain planning permission to build a village of a hundred houses on of greenfield estate land, with the stated aim of funding restoration of the abbey, met with substantial opposition and were turned down in 2005. A subsequent scheme to build 43 houses on a greenfield site south of the nearby small village of Aston, as an "enabling development" to fund repairs to the north wing, again met with opposition; it was rejected by Cheshire East in April 2012 for having "insufficient public benefit ... to outweigh the harm in terms of new residential development in the Open Countryside." The decision was overturned on appeal in January 2013.
Many of the abbey's outbuildings were derelict in the late 20th century. The stables were restored and converted into luxury holiday cottages in 1994–97. Restoration of the game larder and clock tower was completed in the early 21st century, removing the former from the at risk register.
Description.
Little remains of the original monastic buildings, although remnants of medieval stonework from an arch are concealed in a cupboard in the house, and pieces of carved stone have been found in the grounds. The existing house, a grade I listed building, incorporates a building from the west range of the monastery, generally considered to represent the Abbot's House. It has a timber frame with a late-medieval false hammerbeam roof, described by de Figueiredo and Treuherz as "extremely fine" and "exceptionally grand." The timbers are decorated with coats of arms, including those of the abbey, and elaborate bosses to the centre of the trusses. Hammerbeam roofs are rare in Cheshire; the only other known examples are at Vale Royal Abbey and St Nicholas' Chapel in the park of Cholmondeley Castle. The north end of the Great Hall retains the abbey's dais canopy, and in the centre is a smoke bay and louvre.
De Figueiredo and Treuherz write: "Seen from a distance, Combermere appears as a romantic ivy-clad vision of battlements and pinnacles. But its detail is coarse, its massing inept..." Most of the exterior remains coated in grey cement render, in part painted white. The windows throughout feature Y-tracery and are headed with cusped arches. The parapets all have battlements and the roofs are of slate.
The east (entrance) face has three storeys. In the centre is a projecting gabled single-storey porch bearing a stone panel with the Cotton family arms; it is flanked by octagonal turrets. To the south (left) is an octagonal turret. The projecting wing to the south has been reduced to two storeys. To the north (right) of the entrance porch was the Wellington Wing, now demolished. Parts of the render on the north wing have fallen off, revealing the timber frame to the upper storeys, which has ornamental panelling including roundel designs, and carved quatrefoil and fleur-de-lys motifs to the main timbers.
The west (lakeside) face has eight bays, with projecting wings at each end, which each have triple windows to the ground floor. The bays on this face have full-height recessed arches and are separated by pilasters. The single-storey Gothic-style porch is set asymmetrically and consists of three arches; above it is a slight gable. To the south (right) of the southern wing is a further recessed wing which has been reduced to two storeys, with the render removed to expose red brick; it has a two-storey canted bay window.
Over the last 25 years, the abbey has undergone extensive restoration, with the Nina Campbell-designed North Wing now accommodation for guests. 
Interior.
On the ground floor, the main room is the former entrance hall to the west porch, which was adapted into a narrow dining room after the main entrance was moved to the east side. Its interior features date from the early 19th century. The room is crossed by two screens, each flanked with clustered columns whose "delicate" capitals are decorated with lilies and leaves, described as acanthus or lotus. Similar columns also flank the room's marble chimneypiece. The leaf design is repeated on the coving of the modern entrance hall and internal passage. The passage also has clustered columns rising to cast-iron arches in the Perpendicular Gothic style, which de Figueiredo and Treuherz liken to those in the early-19th-century version of Eaton Hall by William Porden.
Originally the Great Hall, the library on the first floor remains the principal reception room of the house. It is separated from the landing at the south end by a "magnificent" carved wooden screen, which probably dates from the early 17th century. The "handsome and boldly-carved design" includes pilasters with lions on the bases flanking paired double doors with arched heads and satyrs in the spandrels, and also incorporates carved cherubs and grotesques, and painted panels to the external (landing) face; it is surmounted by a central emblem. The carved wooden panelling above the stone fireplace incorporates four painted portraits, including Henry VIII and Sir George Cotton, and dates from the 16th and 17th centuries. The remaining panelling in the library is not original. The hammerbeam roof is concealed by a decorated plasterwork ceiling, probably dating from the 17th century. It has broad coving decorated with painted coats of arms, probably added in the 19th century.
Service buildings.
The surviving service buildings to the abbey mainly date from the 18th and 19th centuries, and are predominantly constructed in red brick. Many feature Gothic ornamentation. A service court consisting of two ranges dating from the 18th or early 19th century stands adjacent to the house on the south-east side; the ranges are both listed at grade II. The north range features lancet windows, cross-shaped arrowslits and a parapet with battlements; it includes an octagonal turret and a water tower, both with battlements. The south range includes a square clock tower, built in 1815 to celebrate the Battle of Waterloo; the clock is by JB Joyce &amp; Co. The tower is decorated with arrowslits and capped by an octagonal timber bell cote. Standing in the courtyard is a grade-II*-listed game larder, probably by the Irish Morrison family, which dates from the early 19th century. The octagonal structure is topped with an octagonal wooden lantern. The original ironwork on which game was hung remains in the interior.
The Elizabethan-style stable block dates from 1837 and was designed by Edward Blore. It forms a quadrangle surrounding a rectangular courtyard and incorporates two cottages and a former carriage house. It has stone dressings and features lancet windows, square lead-roofed turrets and an octagonal-flued chimneystack. The arched main entrance is flanked by narrow octagonal turrets topped with spirelets. A ruined icehouse dating from the 18th or 19th century stands near the stables. It consists of a barrel-vaulted passage leading to a chamber with a domed roof. Both buildings are listed at grade II.
Combermere Park.
History.
In the early 18th century, the abbey had large formal gardens. The c. 1730 painting shows the west face, then the entrance front, with a walled forecourt and prominent entrance gates. Formal gardens extend at the rear (east) with trees, ponds and a long straight drive running perpendicular to the house; another small garden with cross-shaped paths lies to the south. Westbury Manor, Long Island, USA now has a gate screen thought to be by Robert Bakewell, originally from Combermere's gardens. The painting shows a summer house on Summerhouse Island, believed to date from around 1700.
The main access to the park at that date was from the west, via a narrow strip of land which formerly separated the main lake from a smaller one to the south. This was excavated during the second half of the 18th century to extend the lake nearer the west face of the house. It is unknown when the park was first landscaped, but it is believed to have contained many mature trees by the 1790s. Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton landscaped the park in 1795–97, possibly employing John Webb. Webb is also said to have designed Brankelow Cottage on the west side of the lake, built in 1797.
Description.
The modern estate extends to , mainly in Cheshire and extending into Shropshire, and is run as an organic dairy farm. The National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens lists of the park at grade II. The gardens include a walled garden of 5 acres (2 ha), in which a maze of fruit trees was created in the 1990s.
The park contains several buildings and structures which are listed at grade II. A sandstone sundial near the house is believed to incorporate the remains of a Romanesque column from the 12th-century abbey. Stone Lodge, formerly the gate lodge at the main (south-east) entrance to the park, has recently been converted into a holiday cottage. The sandstone Elizabethan-style building, by William Vitruvius Morrison, dates from around 1828 and bears two Cotton coats of arms.
Brankelow Cottage, a "charming eyecatcher," stands to the west of Comber Mere at . Built as a model dairy, it was used as a gamekeeper's cottage and is now a folly; the pavilions to each end were formerly used as kennels. It is ornamented with battlements, pinnacles, pilasters, arrowslit windows and fancy brickwork. A sandstone obelisk dated 1890, which commemorates the first Viscount Combermere, stands at on a rise at the north-west edge of the park.
Comber Mere.
The park includes the natural lake of Comber Mere. Covering an area of around , it is the largest lake in a private English park. An area of 169 acres (68.5 ha) of the mere and its surrounding land has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its swamp and fen environments, as well as its importance for birds. The mere is an important overwintering ground for wildfowl, and also has one of the largest heronries in Cheshire.

Plavac Mali

Plavac Mali (), a cross between Crljenak Kaštelanski (ancestral Zinfandel) and Dobričić grapes, is the primary red wine grape grown along the Dalmatian coast of Croatia. The name refers to the small blue grapes that the vines produce: in Croatian "plavo" means blue; "mali" means small.
Plavac Mali is known for producing rich, flavorful wines that are high in both alcohol (typically 13% but up to 17%) and grape tannins. Common flavors and aromas include carob, figs, sage, dark cherries, pepper, and spices. Croatian wines from this grape include the reds from Dingač and Postup vineyards on the Pelješac peninsula, Hvar island, Brač island, Vis island, Komarna vineyards, Konavle and the rosé Opol (a vinification style). The wines from Plavac Mali can be created as dry, semi-dry or sweet. Most common are dry wines, although wines with a little bit of residual sugar are a traditional expression of Plavac Mali.
If not grown in ideal conditions, Plavac Mali is notorious among winegrowers for its uneven ripening properties - a grape cluster with both green berries and raisins. If left to ripen fully, the tannins and sugars increase, but the acids drop. This is why Plavac Mali is a challenge for the winemakers.
History.
In the 1980s, Plavac Mali was incorrectly thought to be an ancestor of Zinfandel. In 1998, while researching the origins of Zinfandel through DNA fingerprinting, Dr. Carole Meredith at UC Davis with the urging from Mike Grgich (a well-known winemaker in Napa Valley originally from Croatia) and researchers from the University of Zagreb discovered that Zinfandel is actually one parent of Plavac Mali. The other parent is an ancient variety known as Dobričić from the island of Šolta which, much like Crljenak Kaštelanski is not commonly found on its own.

Larry Gates

Lawrence Wheaton Gates (September 24, 1915December 12, 1996) was an American actor.
His notable roles include H.B. Lewis on daytime's "Guiding Light" and Doc Baugh in the film version of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" (1958). He played the role of H.B. from 1983 to 1996 and won the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor at the 1985 awards. (He had previously played the role of District Attorney Eric Van Gelder on "Guiding Light" in 1977 and 1978.)
Gates may be best remembered for his role in the 1967 film version of "In the Heat of the Night", where his character Eric Endicott is part of a famous scene involving him slapping Sidney Poitier's face and getting slapped in return.
Early years.
Gates was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota. As a chemical engineering student at the University of Minnesota, he acted in student plays. Some of his early acting experience came at the Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia. His interest in acting led him to change his collegiate focus, and "he ultimately concluded his college career with a speech major".
Career.
Gates had a long career in film, television, and theater. He appeared in the Broadway productions of "The Taming of the Shrew" (1950), "The Teahouse of the August Moon" (1953), "The Carefree Tree" (1955), "Bell, Book and Candle" (1956), "The Highest Tree" (1959), "A Case of Libel" (1964), and "First Monday in October" (1978). Gates played Polonius opposite Sam Waterston in a New York revival of "Hamlet". He starred in the 1976 Broadway play "Poor Murderer", which is about an actor who questions whether or not he, who is playing Hamlet, actually killed the actor playing Polonius, or if it was just a dream. 
His films included "Has Anybody Seen My Gal?" (1952), "Francis Covers the Big Town" (1953), "The Girl Rush" (1955), "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956), "The Strange One" (1957), "The Brothers Rico" (1957), "Some Came Running" (1958), "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" (1958), "The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker" (1959), "One Foot in Hell" (1960), "Underworld U.S.A." (1961), "The Young Savages" (1961), "Ada" (1961), "Toys in the Attic" (1963), "Cattle King" (1963), "The Sand Pebbles" (1966), "In the Heat of the Night" (1967), "Hour of the Gun" (1967), "Death of a Gunfighter" (1969), "Airport" (1970), "Lucky Luciano" (1973), and "Funny Lady" (1975).

Marlo Morgan

Marlo Morgan (born September 29, 1937) is an American author, best known for the bestselling book "Mutant Message Down Under". She has also written "Message from Forever" (1998), another novel based on Australian Aboriginal themes. In 1996, she was confronted about the veracity of her book by Aboriginal protesters and stated that she never meant to hurt any of the people described in her book, whom she also stated that she loved.
"Mutant Message Down Under".
Morgan self-published a book in 1990 titled "Mutant Message Down Under", which purported to chronicle the journey of a middle-aged, white, American woman with a group of 62 desert Aborigines, the "Real People", across the continent of Australia. The author states the book was written after the fact inspired by actual experience.
"Mutant Message Down Under" quickly attained word of mouth popularity with the New Age movement in the United States, was picked up for bookstore distribution by Bookpeople, then consequently picked up by giant publishing firm HarperCollins, and marketed as fiction by them. Nearly a million copies of the HarperCollins publication have been sold around the world. Morgan completed many lecture tours promoting the book in the United States and Europe. In her lectures Morgan speaks of her actual experience with the "Real People" and states she is an Aborigine.
According to the 90-page report published by the Perth-based "Dumbartung Aboriginal Corporation", a survey of Aboriginal groups in Central and Western Australia failed to uncover any indication whatsoever of Morgan's presence in the area or of the existence of the "Real People" tribe. They claim that Aboriginal groups believe Morgan's desert journey to be fabricated and that her book and teaching lack credibility. The "Dumbartung Aboriginal Corporation" stated that it was deeply offensive to Aboriginal people for a white person to be misrepresenting Aboriginal culture for self-promotion and profit. Aboriginal people expressed anger that Morgan's false message is being accepted as fact by a naïve North American and European market and were extremely concerned about the resulting long-term implications for their culture.
In 1996 a group of Aboriginal elders, seriously disturbed by the book's implications, received a grant to travel to the States and confront Morgan about her book and to try to prevent a Hollywood-isation of it. She admitted publicly that she had faked it but this received little publicity in the USA. The Aboriginal people engaging is this discourse are angry that Morgan's book continues to be promoted and sold widely, because they state it gives a false picture of their traditional cultures and of their current political and social status. They regard this as damaging to their struggle for survival.

Andhra Pradesh Legislature

The Andhra Pradesh Legislature is the state legislature of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It follows a Westminster-derived parliamentary system and is composed of an
The Legislature works at the transit building located in the state capital Amaravati.The legislature derives its authority from the Indian constitution, with sole authority to make laws on 61 subjects specified in the state list and shares law-making power in 52 concurrent subjects with the Parliament of India. The state uses first-past-the-post method territorial constituencies for electing members to the lower house. The members of the upper house are indirectly-elected by special constituencies or nominated by the governor. The governor is head of the state authorized to the leader of the legislature.
History.
Andhra Pradesh, the first linguistic state and once the fifth largest state in the Indian union, was formed on 1 November 1956 with the unification of Andhra State and the Telugu speaking areas of the erstwhile Hyderabad State. Consequent to the formation of the State of Andhra Pradesh the 140 Members of the Andhra State Legislative Assembly and 105 Members representing the Telugu speaking areas of Hyderabad State were merged resulting in the formation of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly.
In 1956, the Andhra Pradesh Legislature was Unicameral with only a Legislative Assembly consisting 245 Members. The first meeting of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly was held on 3 December 1956. Ayyadevara Kaleswara Rao and Konda Lakshman Bapuji were elected as the first Speaker and the first Deputy Speaker respectively of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly.
In 1958, with the constitution of the Legislative Council the unicameral Andhra Pradesh Legislature has become bicameral. Due to delimitation of constituencies several ups and downs have taken place in the number of elected Members of Legislative Assembly in Andhra Pradesh. In 1956 it was 245, in 1962 it was 300, in 1967 and 1972 it was 287 and from 1978 onwards it is 294. In 2014, the state was bifurcated into Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The present strength of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly is 175.
B. V. Subba Reddy was the only Presiding Officer who has been elected twice as Speaker in 1962 and 1967 unanimously in the Third and Fourth Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly. The most significant feature of the Fourth Legislative Assembly is that it has the highest number of Independents in the House. Out of the 294 elected Members of the Legislative Assembly 68 Members were Independents. P. Ranga Reddy, who has been elected as Speaker in 1972 by the Fifth Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly also served as the Chairman of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council from 1968 to 1972. He was the only person who has served as the Presiding Officer for both the Houses of Andhra Pradesh Legislature. He was also appointed as Pro-tem Speaker for the Eighth Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly in 1985.
In the history of the Andhra Pradesh Legislature the Seventh Legislative Assembly was the shortest Assembly in terms of its tenure. Another important feature of the Seventh Assembly was when the first Confidence Motion was moved and carried in the House on 20 September 1984. The Eleventh Legislative Assembly which was constituted on 10 October 1999 elected K. Prathibha Bharathi as Speaker, the first women Presiding Officer of the Andhra Pradesh Legislature.
A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India addressed the Twelfth Legislative Assembly on 14 July 2004. It was the second time in the history of the Andhra Pradesh Legislature that the First Citizen of India has addressed the Legislative Assembly. Previously, Dr. Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy addressed the Members of the Legislature on 28 June 1978.
Structure and lawmaking process.
According to the Indian Constitution, every state in India shall have a legislature consisting of the Governor and a legislative assembly. Further, the legislative assembly of the state can decide to create an upper house – the council or abolish the upper house at any point of time. This relation between the two houses was specified in the constitution to strike a balance between large and small states – with the former demanding for more political participation, while the latter citing financial constraints in maintaining two houses. Andhra Pradesh is one of the few states in India to have a bicameral legislature. The state established an upper house in 1957, abolished in 1985 and re-established it in 2007.
The upper house cannot be dissolved and one third of its members retire every second year. The term of the legislative assembly is five years from the date appointed for its first meeting. The cabinet is collectively responsible to the lower house and is in power as long as it enjoys the confidence of the lower house. Ministers are generally members of the lower house, however, they can be a member of either house.
A bill can originate in either house, though money bills can originate only in the lower house. The upper house can only suggest modifications to the bill which is passed by the assembly. If the assembly decides to ignore the changes made by the upper house in its second reading, the council has to accept the bill in original form passed by the assembly. The only power of the council, in ordinary or money bills is to introduce some delay into the legislative process. The bill is then sent to the Governor, who may sign the bill converting it into law or reject it.
Membership and elections.
Of the total number of Members of the Legislative Council (58), one third of Members are elected by electorates consisting of the Members of Local Authorities(20), 1/12 are elected by electorates consisting of graduates residing in the State(5), 1/12 are elected by electorates consisting of persons engaged in teaching(5), 1/3 are elected by the Members of Legislative Assembly (20) and the remaining are nominated by the Governor(8). The specified electorate is divided into territorial constituencies and members are elected on a first-past-the-post basis.
The Legislative Assembly consists of 175 elected members and one member nominated by the Governor from among the Anglo-Indian Community, under Article 333 of the Constitution of India. All persons residing in the state above the age of 18 are eligible to vote in the elections.
Seat of the assembly.
The assembly meets at temporary facilities in the Velagapudi neighbourhood of the new capital city of Andhra Pradesh, Amaravati, having relocated there in March 2017. The first session of the legislature at the new capital began on 6 March 2017.
The assembly met at the State Assembly Building in Hyderabad till March 2017. This was built in 1913 and adjoins the picturesque public gardens known as the hanging gardens.
List of Legislative Assembly constituencies.
There are a total of 175 Assembly Constituencies, across 26 divided districts, in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
Legislative Assembly terms.
The following are the years of constitution and dissolution of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly.

Jiffy Steamer, located in Union City, Tennessee, manufactures a variety of clothing steamers. Jiffy Steamer was founded in 1940.
Product line development.
The company patented the Model J-1 hat steamer in 1940. Hats, such as fedoras, were a popular element of 1940s fashion. The common way of retaining a hat's shape was to place it over a steaming kettle of water. The J-1 was a standalone device that could do the same task without the requirement of a stove. The concept was later applied to the J-2 garment steamer, a larger version of the J-1 hat steamer that included a clothing rack. This product was aimed at the clothing industry to provide a way of removing wrinkles. The company now offers upgraded versions of the original J-2 clothes steamers, including the J-2000 steamer and several variants that provide different head attachments, and the J-4000, more geared towards the commercial marketplace. The company also manufactures a handheld steamer, the ESTEAM.

Scarborough funiculars

The British town of Scarborough has had a total of five cliff railways, or funiculars, two of which are presently operational. The town is home to the first funicular railway in the United Kingdom.
Having noted the need for better transit between the town and its bays, particularly for tourists, the construction of Scarborough's first funicular commenced in 1873. Designed by William Lucas and built by Crossley Brothers on a route between Scarborough Spa on South Sands and the South Cliff Esplanade, this water-driven lift was opened on 6 July 1875. During subsequent years, multiple other funiculars were constructed; in all, two lifts served Scarborough's North Bay while three covered the South Bay. Various means of propulsion, from steam power to electricity have been used over the years, while other upgrades such as automated operations have been implemented as well.
While some of these funiculars remain operational, others have been permanently withdrawn: both of the North Bay railways have been demolished, while one on South Bay is extant but out of use since 2006. The other two South Cliff lifts are still operational. Reasons for closures have included unsuitable terrain, insufficient revenue, excessive capacity in relation to demand and excessive refurbishment/upgrade costs.
South Cliff Lift.
During 1873, the "Scarborough South Cliff Tramway Company Limited" was created to construct the first funicular railway in the United Kingdom. It had long been recognised that the height difference between the town and its beaches was a geographical hindrance to the burgeoning tourism industry, and the construction of a funicular was viewed as a means of better facilitating, and extracting revenue from, such movements. It was specifically decided to build this initial cliff railway between the pre-existing Scarborough Spa on South Sands and the South Cliff Esplanade.
The funicular was designed and engineered principally by William Lucas. Its construction was undertaken by Crossley Brothers of Manchester at a cost of £8,000. Metropolitan Carriage of Birmingham constructed the two cars, each capable of carrying 14 seated passengers. Each car was attached to a twin-steel cable rope, which was originally operated by a brakeman at the top station, while the bottom of each car was also fixed to a water tank. The track is wide and long, on 1 in 1.75 (57%) gradient.
Using seawater pumped by two Crossley gas engines through a hydraulic system designed by Tangye Ltd of Smethwick, Birmingham, the upper car's water tank was filled until the counterbalance point was reached. The cars then proceeded along their individual tracks, its speed and safety both being regulated by the brakeman. When the upper car reached the bottom of the incline, both cars were braked, and the seawater released into a pipe set between the two tracks so that it could be reused. The procedure was then repeated. 
On 6 July 1875, the railway opened. Since opening, it has been refurbished several times; during 1879, the original gas engines were replaced by steam pumps. Between 1935 and 1947, operations were suspended for a time prior to the completion of another refurbishment, which involved the replacement of the water system by 90 hp electric engine. The cars were replaced by two built by Hudswell Clarke &amp; Company in 1934–1935.
During 1993, Scarborough Borough Council purchased the funicular from its owners. In 1997, the control infrastructure of the lift were extensively modified, enabling operations to be handled entirely by its automated systems.
Central Tramway.
During the late 1870s, the Central Tramway Company, Scarborough Limited was formed with the goal of constructing another funicular, the Central Tramway. This railway was built between Foreshore Road and St Nicholas Gardens using track, the selected route covering a distance of over a 1 in 2 (50%) gradient. In 1880, work on the Central Tramway was completed head of its () official commencement of operations on 1 August 1881.
The funicular is operated by two cars. In its original operating configuration, the funicular used steam power generated by equipment sited roughly beneath the top station; this gave the driver no direct view of the cars. To minimise the risk posed by potential equipment failure, each car is equipped with a safety brake system that works in conjunction with a rail located in the centre of each track.
Over its operating life, several changes have been made to this funicular. In 1920, its original steam plant apparatus was retired in favour of an electric drive that was powered via direct current supplied via Scarborough's tramway system. Following the discontinuation of the town's trams, the railway was converted to use alternating current after 1931. During this work period, the original cars were replaced and new motors installed within the top of the station, which provided drivers with a full view of the cars. The lower station has subsequently been replaced by a more modern building.
Passenger demand at the Central Tramway was particularly high, especially amongst guests at Scarborough's neighbouring Grand Hotel. The construction of the nearby St Nicholas Cliff Lift was heavily influenced by the level of demand for the Central Tramway. The lift had been continuously operated by the same company throughout its operating life.
St Nicholas Cliff Lift.
The St Nicholas Cliff Lift () was built by the Medway Safety Lift Company Ltd in 1929 and opened on 5 August of that year. Completed at a cost of £6,000, the Saint Nicholas Cliff Lift is located on the other side of the Grand Hotel from the Central Tramway, near the Aquarium. The track is long on a 1 in 1.33 (75%) gradient, the track gauge is .
During its initial years of operation, there was no bottom station; passengers stepped into the tramcars directly from the pavement. The control equipment was incorporated in the upper station, fares were also paid solely at this station. From the onset, the St Nicholas Cliff Lift was powered by electricity.
In 1945, the railway was sold to Scarborough Corporation. During February 2007, the lift was closed as the borough council could not afford the estimated £445,000 of modifications needed to conform with modern health and safety standards. Furthermore, it had been operating at a loss, which was allegedly also a factor in its closure, while planners had also projected demand to be within the existing capacity of the Central Tram alone. In early 2011, it was announced that the still closed lift might be sold by the council, as it did not have the £630,000 that the repairs were then estimated to cost. The cost of demolishing the lift was estimated to be around £150,000.
After its closure, the two cars were moved to the top of the track and fixed in place, becoming part of the conversion of the top station into the St Nicholas Cafe. The cars offer seating and a balcony was constructed around them. The lower station was converted into an ice cream parlor called The Seastrand. The rails the cars ran on are still present.
North Bay Cliff Lift.
During early 1930, the North Bay Cliff Lift was constructed by the Medway Safety Lift Company Ltd as one element of the wider development of Peasholm Gap. Opening for the first time in August of that year, this lift was the only funicular serving the north bay throughout its operating life.
The funicular was operated by a pair of cars running on parallel tracks, which had a length of and a width of . The propulsion system used an electric drive system.
During September 1996, it was decided to close the lift permanently rather than undertake a series of repairs to correct mechanical issues and address corrosion, which had an estimated cost of £75,000 to complete. Over the following two years, it was entirely dismantled, with the remaining elements being donated to the Launceston Civic Society in 1998.

Queens Parade Cliff Lift.
Observing the South Bay's first cliff railway, opened in 1875, to have been a success, proposals were rapidly actioned for a similar funicular to serve the neighboring North Bay. Thus, on 4 March 1878, the Scarborough Queen's Parade Tramway Company Limited was created to build and operate such a lift. The selected route of the lift was in length across a 1 in 2.5 (40%) slope between Queen's Parade and the Promenade Pier. Built at a relatively fast pace, it was opened for the first time on 8 August 1878.
This first North Bay railway had two cars running on parallel tracks. In many respects, its configuration was that of a typical funicular. Its propulsion system involved a pair of counterbalanced water tanks, one underneath each car; these were alternatively filled and emptied while the cars were in either station to change the weight of the cars and thus move the cars via gravity alone.
However, the Queens Parade Cliff Lift experienced a series of particularly unfortunate events. The opening day was marred by one of the carriages having broken free and crashed into the lower station, with the resulting damage forcing the immediate closure of the funicular. It was not able to reopen until repairs were complete during the following year. This apparent bad luck continued through a series of accidents, including multiple landslips and equipment failures. The quick succession of misfortune caused the railway's management to conclude that the venture was untenable, resulting in operations being permanently ceased during 1887, barely nine years after opening. The neighbouring pier was also ill-fated, being destroyed by a gale in 1905.

Super Fun 21

Super Fun 21 is a variation of blackjack. The game is played using a standard 52 card deck. Aces can be counted as either a one or eleven depending on which value would best benefit the player's hand. All the face cards in the deck each count as ten. The remaining cards are taken at face value. The player must first place a bet and is then dealt two cards face up. The dealer is dealt two cards as well, but one is face up and one face down. The player then has the option to either "hit", (request another card) or "stand" (decline additional cards). The player's hand must beat the dealer's by coming closer to 21 without "busting" (exceeding 21). A winning hand with a total of 21 is called a blackjack, or natural.
The game differs from traditional blackjack because the player automatically wins if his hand has six cards or more with a total of 20. This rule applies even if the dealer has a total of 21 (blackjack). Other advantages to Super Fun 21 include being able to split a hand up to four times, a player's blackjack supersedes a dealer's blackjack, a player may "double down" at any point no matter how many cards he has been dealt, and the player automatically doubles their money with a hand consisting of five cards or more that total 21.
The other major difference between Super Fun 21 and traditional blackjack is that a blackjack only pays 6 to 5 instead of the traditional 3 to 2 payout. This more than makes up for the edge the casino is giving with the liberal rules variations above.
Super Fun 21 was protected by U.S. Patent number 5,979,897 issued in 1999 to Howard F. Grossman, a well-known Las Vegas gaming consultant, and assigned to Tech Art Management, Inc.
Special Side Bet. Player can place a "side bet" on getting a blackjack in a designated suit (e.g. diamonds) only in the first round of a newly shuffled deck or decks. The payout is 300:1 (as indicated in the diagram). Some casinos allow player to designate suit or suits for this special side bet. Due to the high house edge on this side bet (9.2%), it is not popular and most land based and on line casinos excluded this from their games.
Not to be confused with a similar blackjack variation called Fun 21.

River Dee, Cumbria

The River Dee is a river running through the extreme south east of Cumbria, a part of the Craven region traditionally part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Its name possibly derives from Brythonic "deva" meaning "goddess", or from Dent or Dentdale, through which the river flows.
The river rises above Dent Head Farm (on the Dales Way), formed from several smaller streams emanating from Blea Moor Moss, the River Dee makes its way northward past Stone House, where it is joined by Arten Gill, to Cowgill, where it turns left into Dentdale. In Dentdale, it picks up the waters of Deepdale Beck (travelling north from Whernside) before passing Dent and Gawthrop.
The river later passes Lenacre and Rash on its way to meeting the River Rawthey at Catholes, near the town of Sedbergh.
The old water mill at Rash Bridge is thought to have been an inspiration for the folk song "The Jolly Miller of Dee".
The Rawthey goes on to join the River Lune.

NASCAR Canada Series

The NASCAR Canada Series (NCS, ) is a national NASCAR racing series in Canada, and is a continuation of the old CASCAR Super Series which was founded in 1981. It is the top NASCAR touring series in Canada.
History.
In September 2006 NASCAR purchased the CASCAR Super Series, the top Canadian stock-car racing series at the time. At the same time, they established a sponsorship agreement with Canadian Tire as the title sponsor. They also signed a television contract with TSN to carry all events with select races being aired live.
Three of the series races, Edmonton, Toronto and Montreal, had crowds in excess of 50,000 fans.
The 2007 season was the inaugural season for the series with the first event being held on May 26, 2007, at Cayuga Motor Speedway with Don Thomson Jr. winning in a spirited battle. Andrew Ranger, in his first year of stock-car competition, won the second race, at Mosport International Raceway. He took over the lead in the points standings after that event and never relinquished it on his way to the first championship. The first season saw five races decided on last-lap passes.The 2008 season featured Scott Steckly who dominated many events. He won three of the first four events of the year and held the lead in the driver championship point standings all season long. He set a series record with four victories throughout the year.
The third season had Andrew Ranger taking centre stage by winning his second series championship in three seasons. He completed his transition from the open-wheel racing world by incorporating his road courses experience with a strong performances on the oval tracks. During the season, he won a single-season series record six races—three on road courses and three on ovals.
The 2010 season belonged to D. J. Kennington. He won his first series title on the power of five wins, nine top-fives and eleven top-10 finishes. Kennington battled J. R. Fitzpatrick for the points lead all season as the two exchanged the top spot an unprecedented five times. Kennington also finished second to fellow Pinty's Series competitor Jason Bowles in the Toyota All-Star Showdown.
In 2011, Steckly had a strong season where he won three events and finished in the runner-up position four times on his way to capture his second championship over Kennington, who had a pair of wins. Long-time road racer Robin Buck and rookie Peter Shepherd won their first events. Ranger won the two biggest events of the year in dominant fashion at Montreal and Toronto. Former champion Don Thomson Jr. retired after a lengthy career.
In 2012, Kennington won a record seven events, including five consecutively, during the summer. Kennington won his second championship in three years. He faced competition from runners-up J. R. Fitzpatrick and Ranger who both won two events.
In 2013, Steckly won four events, including three in a row. Steckly won his third championship in six years. Louis-Philippe Dumoulin won the season opening race at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, his first victory in the series with veteran Jeff Lapevich finishing in the runner up position. Peter Shepherd would win the next two events with Andrew Ranger winning the 4th event of the season. Steckly won the title by only two points over D. J. Kennington. 
In 2014, L.P. Dumoulin would win his first career championship. He would win two events this season. Other drivers to win this season include J. R. Fitzpatrick, Andrew Ranger, Scott Steckly, Jason Hathaway and Donald Chisholm. Dumoulin would win the title by only three points over Fitzpatrick.
On February 17, 2015, Canadian Tire did not renew their sponsorship of the series after the 2015 season. On December 7, NASCAR and Pinty's Delicious Foods Inc. signed a six-year agreement to sponsor the series beginning with the 2016 season.
The 2018 Pinty's Series also included its first race in the United States, at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, replacing the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series on their fall race weekend that continues to feature the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series East and the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour, now the featured division with the Musket 250.
For the 2019 season Continental AG replaced Goodyear as exclusive tire supplier for the series with their General Tire branding. Also it was announced that all races would be live in the United States through fanschoice.tv and six races live through TSN in Canada.
In December 2019, NASCAR changed their schedule. The series would be returning to two previous tracks - Sunset Speedway and Circuit ICAR. The series was also set to produce their first-ever dirt race at Ohsweken Speedway in August 2020. Rescheduled for August 2022.
Because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, a shortened 2020 season called the Pinty's Fan Cave Challenge was completed that consisted of six races at three tracks. Sunset Speedway, Flamboro Speedway and Jukasa Motor Speedway played host to three double race weekends that made up the entire season.
On November 21, 2023, it was announced that the series would be renamed into the NASCAR Canada Series, with Pinty's and Evirum serving as presenting partners.
Diversity.
The NASCAR Pinty's Series contains drivers with many different agendas and backgrounds. Veteran Canadian drivers compete in the series on a part-time basis for fun while maintaining full-time careers, while others are serious championship contenders. In recent years, a NASCAR regional series driver from the United States will often run in the races to gain experience and with NASCAR's specification engine rule. Drivers include Cale Gale, Jason Bowles, Timmy Hill, Tony Stewart, Dave Blaney and Austin Dillon. Drivers with open-wheel and road racing backgrounds have also attempted races, including, Jacques Villeneuve, Max Papis, Alex Tagliani, Jean-François Dumoulin and Patrick Carpentier. Even former National Hockey League player Patrice Brisebois runs in the major events which now feature over 40 cars.
In 2011, at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, a record three female drivers, Maryeve Dufault, Caitlin Johnston and Isabelle Tremblay, attempted the event.
The series is a development, or feeder, series for NASCAR's top national touring divisions. Drivers like Fitzpatrick, Kennington, Ranger, Steckly and Thomson Jr. have competed in the Xfinity Series, while Pierre Bourque and Derek White have raced in the Camping World Truck Series. Ranger finished third in the 2009 NASCAR Nationwide Series event in Montreal after battling with eventual race winner Carl Edwards for much of the race. He competed in the 2011 Sprint Cup Series event at Watkins Glen for FAS Lane Racing finishing 35th after suffering from transmission failure.
On June 2, 2019, Julia Landauer became the first woman in NASCAR Canada history to lead a lap when she led lap 72 of the APC 200 at Jukasa Motor Speedway.
On August 15, 2022, Aaron Turkey became the first indigenous person to win, at the First ever NASCAR Event on Dirt. (The Pinty's 100 - Quick Wick Hot Lap Winner) at Ohsweken Speedway in Six Nations.
Tracks.
The following are the tracks which have been, and are currently used in the NASCAR Canada Series:
Cars.
A gradual implementation of both competition and safety-based modifications have been made to the cars used in the CASCAR Super Series. These include a move to Goodyear 9.5" tires, the same size that is used in all NASCAR stock-car series, on-dash electrical and ignition systems, in-car fire-suppression equipment and increased fuel cell protection. In 2009, the option of utilizing the NASCAR spec engine program was introduced. The cars use steel tube-framed silhouette stock cars powered by carbureted V8 engines. The cars have a relatively high minimum weight, so development of lightweight components is minimal. A number of components are specified by the rules, as parity is given priority over vehicle development. Manufacturer involvement is therefore limited largely to supply arrangements for long-developed crate motors, and branding on the largely standard bodywork.
Manufacturer representation.
Types of cars used include the Ford Mustang, Ford Fusion, Chevrolet Camaro, and Dodge Challenger. The NASCAR Pinty's Series was the last NASCAR series in which Dodge still provided factory support, as the series was supported by the Canadian arm of Fiat Automobili, S.p.A., having pulled out of the United States and Mexican series after 2012. Factory support ended before the shortened 2020 season. It is also one of two series Toyota does not participate in, the other being the NASCAR Brasil Sprint Race; it was also the last NASCAR series which had factory support from Pontiac prior to going out of business in 2010 after General Motors's Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
List of series champions.
Scott Steckly has the most Canada Series championships with four by winning in 2008, 2011, 2013, and 2015.
All-time wins.
All-time wins under the NASCAR banner, starting at 2007 season. Does not include CASCAR SuperSeries wins. As of the 2025 NASCAR Canada Series season.

Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow

Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow is a United States Marine Corps supply and maintenance installation located in the Mojave Desert east of Barstow, in San Bernardino County, Southern California.
Its mission is to rebuild and repair ground-combat and combat-support equipment and to support installations on the West Coast of the United States. Today, one of MCLB Barstow's most important facilities is the Marine Corps Logistics Bases' Maintenance Center. The only other facility of this kind is located at MCLB Barstow's sister installation, Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany.
Location.
The base is located on Interstate 40, 3.5 miles (6 km) east of the city of Barstow. The base lies at the junction of three major highways systems of I-15, I-40, and SR 58. It is approximately 98 miles from the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms. The base is within of the two major seaports of Los Angeles and San Diego.
History.
The Marine Corps Logistics Base, presently the second largest employer in the Barstow area, was established as the Marine Corps Depot of Supplies at its present location on December 28, 1942, when the United States Navy turned it over to the Marine Corps as a storage site for supplies and equipment needed for Fleet Marine Forces in the Pacific theater during World War II. By the end of World War II, the base had outgrown its facilities and as a result, 2,000 acres (8 km2) of land, approximately seven miles east of the Nebo Main Base were annexed from the United States Army in October 1946. In 1954, the Commanding General, Marine Corps Depot of Supplies, Roy M. Gulick, moved his flag from San Francisco to Barstow and since then the base has grown in stature, strength and size.In March 1961, the importance of MCLB Barstow increased dramatically with the establishment of the Depot Maintenance Activity. (Need Help to correct the start date if needed--"In 1977 TOW Company was assigned to MCLB Barstow through 1980 while facilities were being built at 29 Palms, California.") In November 1978, the base was redesignated to its present title of Marine Corps Logistics Base to emphasize its broad logistics support mission. In the early 1980s, MCLB Albany and Headquarters Marine Corps worked aggressively to integrate logistics support for the Fleet Marine Force and eliminate duplications. As a result, all operational logistics functions moved to Albany and in January 1990, the Commanding General, Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, was redesignated Commander Marine Corps Logistics Bases. The command was redesignated again in 2003 as a result of the merging of Material Command MATCOM and Marine Corps Logistics Bases to form Marine Corps Logistics Command (MARCORLOGCOM).
In late 2005, MCLB Barstow started a transition from military police to civilian police to free Marines for deployment; the Provost Marshal Office, military police, was augmented with a civilian Marine Corps Police Department, while many of the Marine Military Police stationed aboard the base have transferred to other commands. The transition from a Provost Marshal Office to a Marine Corps Police Department ended in 2007. As of late 2007, the department became the first police department in the Marine Corps to consist of all civilian officers. In 2010, the department became a blended force again with military police.
Sites.
The base comprises three principal sites: Nebo Annex, Yermo Annex, and a third site serving as rifle and pistol ranges.
Nebo Annex.
The Nebo Annex encompasses and functions as base headquarters and is the main facility for administration, storage, recreational activities, shopping, and housing functions. The Nebo annex had a population of 1,174 as of the 2000 Census. Of the population 54% is male; 65.6% is between the ages of 18 and 64, and 34.2% is under 18. The median age is 22.6.
Yermo Annex.
The Yermo Annex, (Yermo Marine Corps Supply Center) in the town of Yermo, encompasses and is primarily a storage and industrial complex for the Marine Corps.
World War 2.
Yermo Holding and Reconsignment Point opened on July 22, 1942, to control the shipment of supplies into West Coast ports by rail. In October 1946 the facility was transferred to Marine Corps Depot of Supplies. Later renamed Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow in November 1978. 
During World War 2 the site housed:

Treasure Valley Rollergirls

The Treasure Valley Rollergirls (TVR) is a women's flat track roller derby league based in Boise, Idaho. Founded in 2006, Treasure Valley is a member of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA).
History and organization.
Treasure Valley was formed in February 2006, shortly after the television series "Rollergirls" began airing, and played its first season the following year. In January 2008, it faced the top teams in the Northwest in a tournament hosted by the Rat City Rollergirls. Around this point, it had four teams: the B-Town Battalion, Cell Block B, the Devil's Darlings and the Derailers, but these were subsequently disbanded shortly after the omnibus league moved from its grass roots beginnings at Expo Idaho in Garden City to Century Link Arena in downtown Boise.
The league was accepted into the WFTDA Apprentice Program in April 2010, and became a full member of the WFTDA in September 2011. Treasure Valley began hosting a tournament in its own right, the annual SpudTown Knockdown, an international annual two-day double bracket elimination tournament (typically held at what is now Idaho Central Arena in downtown Boise over the Labor Day weekend). Characterized as "the Best of the Rest of the West," as it took place prior to the WFTDA's annual Playoff tournaments, the fourth annual SpudTown Knockdown, in a return to the TVR's roots, was held at Expo Idaho on July 20–21, 2013.
WFTDA competition.
Treasure Valley has competed at WFTDA Division 2 Playoffs numerous times, most recently at the Division 2 Playoffs and Championship in 2017 as the #13 seed in Pittsburgh, where they lost both their games to finish out of the medals.
Post pandemic.
WFTDA moved back to regional ranking. Treasure Valley Roller Derby held its first post-pandemic event June 25, 2022, a round-robin tournament named 'Bout Time. Skaters from Wasatch Roller Derby and Jackson Hole Juggernauts came to Eagle Idaho to play at the Eagle Ada sports complex. 
Treasure Valley Roller Derby also traveled in 2022 to Carson City Nevada and competed in the Battle for the Silver Skate. Treasure Valley Roller Derby played 3 games and won each, taking home the trophy for the tournament. 
In 2023, Treasure Valley Roller Derby gained enough skaters to revive the B team, Boise River Rollers. The league held 5 doubleheader game nights at Idaho Central Arena in Downtown Boise. The All-Stars went undefeated over their home summer season. The All-Stars then traveled to Reno, Nevada in October of 2023 to Sierra Regional Roller Derby's Tournament, Deep Blue. The All-Stars played 2 WFTDA Sanctioned games there and won both against Monterey Bay Roller Derby and High Altitude Roller Derby. The All-Stars improved their ranking from the beginning of 2023 at 54, in WFTDA North American West Region, to 19.

Wilfred Cantwell Smith

Wilfred Cantwell Smith, (July 21, 1916 – February 7, 2000) was a Canadian Islamicist, comparative religion scholar, and Presbyterian minister. He was the founder of the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill University in Quebec and later the director of Harvard University's Center for the Study of World Religions. The "Harvard University Gazette" said he was one of the field's most influential figures of the past century. In his 1962 work "The Meaning and End of Religion" he notably questioned the modern sectarian concept of religion.
Early life and career.
Smith was born on 21 July 1916 in Toronto, Ontario, to parents Victor Arnold Smith and Sarah Cory Cantwell. He was the younger brother of Arnold Smith and the father of Brian Cantwell Smith. He primarily received his secondary education at Upper Canada College.
Smith studied at University College, Toronto, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree with honours in oriental languages circa 1938. After his thesis was rejected by the University of Cambridge, supposedly for its Marxist critique of the British Raj, he and his wife Muriel Mackenzie Struthers spent seven years in pre-independence India (1940–1946), during which he taught Indian and Islamic history at Forman Christian College in Lahore.
In 1948, he earned a PhD in Oriental Languages from Princeton University, after which he joined the faculty at McGill University. In 1952, he founded the university's Institute of Islamic Studies. During his tenure at McGill, he invited Ismail al-Faruqi to join the Institute, where al-Faruqi taught from 1958 to 1961.
From 1964 to 1973, he was a professor at Harvard Divinity School. He later moved to Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he established the Department of Religion. He was also one of the original editorial advisors for the journal "Dionysius". In 1978, he returned to Harvard.
The following year, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Concordia University.
After retiring from Harvard in 1984, he was appointed senior research associate in the Faculty of Divinity at Trinity College, University of Toronto, in 1985.
Views on religion.
Critique of "Religion" as a Concept.
In "The Meaning and End of Religion" (1962), Smith critiqued the concept of "religion" as a systematic, identifiable entity. He argued that the term "religion" is a uniquely Western construct and not a universally valid category. Smith proposed replacing the static concept of religion with a dynamic dialectic between "cumulative tradition" (all historically observable rituals, art, music, theologies, etc.) and "personal faith".
Analysis of Major Religions.
Smith demonstrated that founders and followers of major religions did not see themselves as part of a defined system called religion, with Islam being a notable exception. In his chapter "The Special Case of Islam", Smith noted that the term Islam appears in the Qur'an, making it the only religion named by its own tradition. He also highlighted that the Arabic language does not have a word for religion equivalent to the European concept, detailing how "din", usually translated as such, differs significantly.
Historical Evolution of the Term.
Smith pointed out that terms for major world religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism did not exist until the 19th century. He suggested that practitioners historically did not view their practices as "religion" until cultural self-regard prompted them to see their practices as different from others. For Smith, the modern concept of religion emerged from identity politics and apologetics.
Etymological Study.
Through an etymological study, Smith argued that "religion" originally denoted personal piety but evolved to mean a system of observances or beliefs, a shift institutionalized through reification. He traced this transformation from Lucretius and Cicero through Lactantius and Augustine, with the term "faith" predominating in the Middle Ages. The Renaissance revived "religio," which retained its personal practice emphasis. During the 17th-century Catholic-Protestant debates, religion began to refer to abstract systems of beliefs, a concept further reified during the Enlightenment, exemplified by G.W.F. Hegel's definition of religion as a self-subsisting transcendent idea.
Four Distinct Senses of "Religion".
Smith concluded that "religion" now has four distinct senses: personal piety, an overt system of beliefs, practices, and values as an ideal religion, an empirical phenomenon related to a particular community's historical and sociological manifestation, and a generic summation or universal category of religion in general.
"The Meaning and End of Religion" remains Smith's most influential work. The anthropologist of religion and postcolonial scholar Talal Asad has called it a modern classic and a masterpiece.
Death and legacy.
Smith died on 7 February 2000 in Toronto. His papers are preserved in Special Collections and Archives at the University Library at California State University, Northridge.

Persillade

Persillade () is a sauce or seasoning mixture of parsley () chopped together with seasonings including garlic, herbs, oil, and vinegar.
In its simplest form, just parsley and garlic, it is a common ingredient in many dishes, part of a sauté cook's "mise en place". If added early in cooking, it becomes mellow, but when it is added at the end of cooking or as a garnish, it provides a garlicky jolt. It is extensively used in French and French-influenced cuisines, as well as in Cajun, Louisiana Creole, and Québécois cuisines. 
A classic French and Quebec bistro dish is "pommes persillade", cubed potatoes fried in a small amount of oil, with persillade added at the end of the cooking, and can sometimes be combined with Quebec "poutine "to produce a hybrid dish called "poutine persillade". Persillade is also popular in Louisiana; New Orleans chef Austin Leslie's signature dish was fried chicken with persillade.
Variations.
There are many variations, either adding other ingredients or substituting other herbs, such as bay leaf, oregano, basil, or tarragon, for the parsley. Combined with bread crumbs, it is used as crust for roasted veal or lamb chops. The addition of lemon zest creates "gremolata", a traditional garnish for braised lamb shanks. Anchovy is a common addition in Provençal cooking. A small amount of olive oil is often added to persillade to make it easier to use.

Upytė

Upytė is a small village in Panevėžys district municipality in northern Lithuania. It is situated some 12 km southwest of Panevėžys on the banks of Vešeta Creek. It is now the capital of an elderate. In 1987 it had 580 residents. In the Lithuanian language, Upytė is a diminutive form of the word "upė", which means river.
In 2004 Upytė celebrated its 750th anniversary by holding a conference "Upytė Land: History and Culture". Upytė linen museum is located in Stultiškiai.
History.
The name Upytė was first mentioned in 1254 in a Livonian chronicle dealing with the divisions of the Upmala region. Upytė had a wooden castle built on an island which later became a hillfort when Lake Vešeta was drained. The castle was an important northern defence post against numerous incursions of the Livonian Order. Between 1353 and 1379 alone, it repelled ten such attacks. The castle was further expanded and fortified in the 15th century, when it served as the seat of the Starost of Upytė. It is believed that the abandoned castle collapsed in the 17th century after the seat of the starost was moved to Panevėžys. The remnants of the castle survived into the 18th century.
Upytė was a capital of the Upytė region () in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The area was later made into an eldership, part of the Principality of Trakai. A document from 1556 states that Panevėžys, along with 57 other towns and 359 villages was part of this eldership. In the 16th century, Upytė began to lose its prominence when the defensive castle became obsolete, and Krekenava became the capital of the Upytė Eldership in 1548. At that time, Panevėžys grew to become a center of economic importance and Upytė became eclipsed by this rival. Nevertheless, Upytė is one of the longest surviving regional capitals from earlier times.
The elders of Upytė included Konstanty Ostrogski, Stanislovas Goštautas, Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł and Janusz Radziwiłł. In 1652, one of its elders, a delegate to Warsaw Sejm, Władysław Siciński (Polish name, in Lithuanian known as "Čičinskas"), allegedly bribed by Janusz Radziwiłł, was the first person to execute his "Liberum veto" rights in order to disrupt Sejm convention. The "Liberum veto" was believed to be one of the factors leading to the collapse of Polish-Lithuanian democracy, and eventually to the partition of the commonwealth by foreign powers.
According to a local legend the evil master Čičinskas was struck by thunder god Perkūnas for all his sins, and his estate sank in a sinkhole located near the Upytė hillfort, called now the "Hill of Čičinskas". The legend has it that his dead body appeared since and haunted the Russians in the neighbourhood. Eventually, Mikhail Muravyov the Hanger ordered it to be exhumed and buried under the floor of the church in 1865. According to the legend this led to Muravyov's death soon after. The legend was reproduced by poets Adam Mickiewicz in his ballad "The Stay in Upita" and Maironis in his poem "Čičinskas". It was also mentioned by a number of other Lithuanian and Polish authors.
In 1938 archeologists excavated a graveyard near Upytė, dating from the 3-5th centuries, containing 51 graves of women, men, and children. The graves provided a number of findings: men's graves had iron tools and guns (bridles, axes, knives, etc.) and women's had bronze jewellery (bracelets, pins, pendants, beads, etc.)

McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System

The McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS) is part of the United States inland waterway system originating at the Tulsa Port of Catoosa and running southeast through Oklahoma and Arkansas to the Mississippi River. The total length of the system is . It was named for two senators, Robert S. Kerr (D-OK) and John L. McClellan (D-AR), who pushed its authorizing legislation through Congress. The system officially opened on June 5, 1971. President Richard M. Nixon attended the opening ceremony. It is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
While the system primarily follows the Arkansas River, it also includes portions of the Verdigris River in Oklahoma, the White River in Arkansas, and the Arkansas Post Canal, a short canal named for the nearby Arkansas Post National Memorial, which connects the Arkansas and White Rivers.
Through Oklahoma and Arkansas, dams artificially deepen and widen the modest-sized river to build it into a commercially navigable body of water. The design enables traffic to overcome an elevation difference of between the Mississippi River and the Tulsa Port of Catoosa. Along the section of the Arkansas River that carries the McClellan–Kerr channel, the river sustains commercial barge traffic and offers passenger and recreational use. Here, the system is a series of reservoirs.
Official change of significance.
The U.S. Department of Transportation officially announced in early May 2015 that it had upgraded MKARNS from "Connector" to "Corridor" on the National Marine Highway. The announcement also added the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) as an official sponsor.
In 2015, the USACE increased its designation of the MKARNS from a moderate-use to a high-use waterway system, which means that a waterway carries more than 10 million tons per year, having a value of more than 12 million ton-miles per year.
Construction.
The Arkansas River is very shallow through Arkansas and Oklahoma, and was naturally incapable of supporting river traffic through most of the year. To allow for navigation, construction was started in 1963 on a system of channels and locks to connect the many reservoirs along the length of the Arkansas River. The first section, running to Little Rock, Arkansas, opened on January 1, 1969. The first barge to reach the Port of Catoosa arrived in early 1971.
Each lock measures wide and long, the standard size for much of the Mississippi River waterway. Standard jumbo barges, measuring 35 by , are grouped three wide by three long, with a tug at center rear, to form a barge tow that can be fit into a lock. Larger barge tows must be broken down and passed through the lock in sections, and rejoined on the opposite side.
The specifications for the channel itself are:
Although Congress originally authorized USACE to dredge the channel to a depth of in 2005, it did not provide the funds to do so. ODOT says that the capacity of each barge could be increased by 200 tons for each foot of draft. An article in 2010 stated that much of MKARNS is already deep, so that only about would need to be deepened. The article quoted Lt. Col. Gene Snyman, then deputy commander of the USACE's Tulsa District, as saying such a project would cost about $170 million (in 2010 dollars).
Lock information.
The tables below list the features of the navigation system, from the Mississippi River to the origin at the Port of Catoosa. Except as noted, all locks are on the Arkansas River.
No lock 11 exists; sequentially, it would have been in the middle of Lake Dardanelle. Per the animated system map (see "External links"), Dardanelle Lock and Dam (lock 10), which forms Lake Dardanelle, is the highest facility on the system (54 feet between upper and lower pools); Ozark-Jeta Taylor Lock and Dam (lock 12), just above that lake, is the third-highest (34 ft). Thus, those two facilities likely were redesigned, in terms of height and possibly location, so as to eliminate lock 11 as originally planned. The Mississippi River lock is numbered lock 99, as it was added to the system after it was completed.
2019 Arkansas River flooding.
Extremely heavy rains hit the Arkansas River upstream of Keystone Dam during late May and early June 2019. So much water poured into the Keystone Reservoir in a short time that it quickly became evident that a major release of water would be needed to prevent overtopping the dam, causing devastating floods downstream. Even so, water rushed downstream toward MKARNS at such a high rate that officials at USACE halted barge traffic to avoid calamities such as collisions or hitting trees and debris afloat in the river.
By October, barge traffic was allowed on a limited basis. Normally, tows comprise 12 to 16 barges. However, the flood carried so much silt down river that redredging would be required to return to normal traffic patterns. In October, the tows were limited to six barges (two wide and three deep).
The 2019 flood deposited about 1.5 million cubic yards of sediment into the waterway, As of February 2020, barge traffic remained limited by tow size and restricted to daylight hours only due to sediment. USACE was expected to complete the dredging of sediment by late May 2020.
Waterway traffic control.
The growth of business along MKARNS has greatly increased congestion at the locks. The Secretary of the Army has directed USACE to establish these priorities for admitting vessels to each lock:
No minimum size is required for watercraft using the locks. Craft as small as canoes, dinghies, and kayaks have all been allowed to use the locks, either alone or with multiple other vessels at the same time. If commercial traffic is heavy, pleasure craft may be required to wait about 1.5 hours or may be allowed to lock through with commercial vessels.

Cureglia

Cureglia is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
Cureglia is first mentioned in 1335 as "Curea" or "Curilia".
In 1468, the village of Comano, which belonged to Cureglia, broke away from the parish of Lugano. Cureglia became an independent parish in 1594. The parish church of S. Cristoforo, was first mentioned in 1420. In the 19th century it was totally rebuilt. The Chapel of S. Maria del Buon Consiglio was built in the 18th century.
The village was predominantly agricultural and produced mostly wine and cheese. However, a number of craftsman families, including the Caresana, Rinaldi, Saroli, Tarilli and Brilli, moved away in the 16th and 17th centuries for work in other European countries. Successful members of the families moved back to the village and built large homes, which are still standing in the village. The progressive urbanization of the surrounding area of Lugano and the establishment of the television studios in Comano favored a rapid increase in population. From 1950 to 2000, the number of residents quadrupled and housing was built outside the old village core.
Geography.
Cureglia has an area, , of . Of this area, or 46.2% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 45.3% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 45.3% is settled (buildings or roads).
Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 34.9% and transportation infrastructure made up 4.7%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.9% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 3.8%. Out of the forested land, 38.7% of the total land area is heavily forested and 6.6% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 10.4% is used for growing crops and 34.9% is used for alpine pastures.
The municipality is located in the Lugano district, at the watershed between Val Vedeggio and Valle del Cassarate.
Coat of arms.
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is "Or a hatsable with a feather gules."
Demographics.

Scărișoara Cave

Scărișoara Cave (, ), is one of the biggest ice caves in the Apuseni Mountains of Romania, in the western part of the Romanian Carpathians. It is considered a show cave and one of the natural wonders of Romania. It has also been described as a glacier cave.
History.
First mentioned in 1863 by the Austrian geographer Arnold Schmidl, who made some observations and the first map of the cave, it was later explored by the Romanian scientist and speleologist Emil Racoviță between 1921 and 1923, who mentioned it and its origin in his 1927 work "Speologia" (Speleology). The ice cave was formed 3,500 years ago, during the glaciations, when these mountains were covered by snow and ice. The exact date when the cave was first discovered by humans is unknown.
Description.
The cave is located at an altitude of approximately above sea level. It is deep and long. The entrance shaft, which is in diameter and in depth, gives access through metal stairs to a large chamber, the Great Hall, which is approximately long and wide. The Great Hall includes an ice cliff nearly tall, which overlooks a pool called the Pool of Ice.
From the Great Hall, passages lead into several other named rooms: the Church, which features over 100 ice stalagmites, the Great Reservation, Coman Gallery to the left, and Little Reservation to the right. 
The ice within the cave has an estimated volume of and in some places can be as thick as . The temperature is up to +1 °C in the summer and down to -7 °C in the winter. In the part for tourists the average temperature is around 0 °C. Bats live in the ice cave, as do small bugs (2–3 mm long) called "Pholeuon prozerpinae glaciale". In the "Big Reservation" a Rupicapra skeleton was discovered.
Access.
The portion of the cave open to tourists includes the entrance shaft, The Big Hall and The Church. Access to the other chambers is reserved for scientific research by the agreement of the Speological Institute of Cluj-Napoca.

Finishing the Game

Finishing the Game is a 2007 mockumentary film directed by Justin Lin focusing on Bruce Lee's final movie "Game of Death" (1972), which was unfinished at the time of his death. Shot in 18 days, "Finishing the Game" comically satirizes the 1972 production—which used body doubles and clips from other Lee movies—and addresses racial stereotypes in the Asian community.
Its world premiere took place at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, where it was an Official Selection. It was also selected as the opening night film at the 25th San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival.
Reception.
"Finishing the Game" received mostly negative reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 34% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's consensus reads, "Though Justin Lin's premise is precocious enough, the sight gags and comic timing are tired in this mockumentary about Asian typecasting in the 1970s." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 46 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.

Myanmar national cricket team

The Myanmar national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Myanmar in international cricket matches. It has been an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2006 and an associate member since 2017.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Myanmar and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.
History.
British rule.
Cricket in Myanmar dates back to when Burma was a province of British India. The British brought the game there, as they did to the rest of India, and the game progressed to the level where the Marylebone Cricket Club played two two-day first class matches there on a tour to India in 1926/1927. The first of these was played at the Gymkhana ground in Rangoon against a Rangoon Gymkhana cricket team. That game was drawn with the MCC on top after forcing the home side to follow-on. The second game was against the Burma team themselves at the BAA Ground, also in Rangoon. The MCC won this game restricting Burma to low scores in both their innings, and only having to chase 7 runs to win in their second innings. These remains the country's only first class games.
Reemergence.
Following independence cricket remained very much a minority sport in Myanmar, and was nowhere to be seen between 1988 and 1995. In 2002 the game was seeing a resurgence, with a seven team league organised by former Bengal first class player Naresh Kumar , with some former first class players taking part in games attended by around 250 people. Cricket has also been featured on TV news reports. The Myanmar Cricket Federation received a visit from the ICC in 2004 and became an affiliate member of the organisation in 2006. The game is currently played primarily by ex-pats, but the game has recently been introduced into schools.
2006 ACC Trophy.
Just two months after gaining ICC membership, Myanmar headed to Malaysia to take part in the 2006 ACC Trophy for the first time. They had a very poor tournament, with a series of heavy defeats to Kuwait (by 9 wickets in 10 overs), to Hong Kong (by 422 runs, with Myanmar being bowled out for 20) and to Bhutan (by 9 wickets in 6.5 overs; Bhutan had also received heavy defeats in their previous matches).
The nadir of their tournament came against Nepal, where Myanmar were bowled out for just 10 off 12.1 overs after losing the toss and being sent in; no batsman scored more than one, the innings included five ducks, and extras top scored with five (three leg byes and two wides). Nepal hit three off the first ball, followed by three wides that went for five, and then hit another three from the second legitimate delivery to win by ten wickets. Some critics called it the greatest mismatch in the history of international cricket, and the score of 10 is the lowest in any level of men's international cricket.
2009–present.
With the separation of the ACC Trophy into Elite and Challenge divisions, Myanmar have since competed in the Challenge divisions in both 2009, in which they came last, and 2010. Despite the cricket being of a lesser quality than the Elite division, Myanmar have continued to suffer from heavy defeats.
In August 2017, Myanmar played cricket at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games after a five-year absence from international cricket. In the 50-over tournament, they won only one out of four matches, defeating Indonesia by four wickets. This was Myanmar's first ever victory in international cricket. In the 20-over tournament, they lost both their games.
Myanmar played their first T20I on 26 July 2023, against Bhutan, during the 2023 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier.
Myanmar registered their first ever victory in T20Is against China on 29 January 2024 in the 2024 ACC Men's Challenger Cup.

Yacine Benalia

Yacine Benalia was an Algerian-born British citizen and Islamist militant who allegedly participated in the Beslan school hostage crisis in September 2004. Whether he truly participated is unclear, as he was also reported killed in Chechnya in March 2004, six months before the hostage drama in North Ossetia.
Rebel activity.
Benalia allegedly fled Algeria in the 1990s for London, where he eventually became a British citizen. According to Scotland Yard, he was a frequent visitor of the Finsbury Park Mosque, known at the time for the fiery jihadist preaching of Abu Hamza al-Masri. Benalia is said to have arrived in the North Caucasus in 2001 in order to battle Russian forces during the Second Chechen War.
Death.
While some reports suggest Benalia possibly died in the siege of the school in Beslan, it has also been reported that he - along with fellow Algerian militant Osman Larussi - was killed by Russian federal forces in Chechnya on 8 March 2004.

Green later legally changed his name to Seth Benjamin Green. He was raised Jewish and had a bar mitzvah ceremony. His ancestors were from Russia, Poland, and Scotland. Green started acting at the age of 7. His early comic influences included Monty Python, "Blackadder", "Saturday Night Live", Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby, "Porky's", and "Caddyshack".
Career.
Early work.
Green's first film roles were in the 1984 films "Billions for Boris" and "The Hotel New Hampshire"; the second film cast him alongside Jodie Foster and Rob Lowe. He appeared in the 1987 film "Can't Buy Me Love", playing Patrick Dempsey's character's little brother, Chuckie Miller. He starred in Woody Allen's "Radio Days" (1987) as Joe (a 1930s–1940s boy based on Allen) and appeared in "Big Business" (1988) and, in the same year, "My Stepmother Is an Alien", which also starred "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" co-star Alyson Hannigan.
In 1984, Green portrayed Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer in the Jell-O Gelatin Pops commercials featuring "The Little Rascals". In 1991, Green rose to fame in a Rally's "Cha Ching" commercial, which earned him an appearance at a New Orleans Saints game. Green was given a key to New Orleans in honor of his role in the popular commercial.
Green appeared in the horror TV series "It" (as Richie Tozier, age 12) and "Ticks", all three "Austin Powers" films (as Dr. Evil's son, Scott), and "Enemy of the State" and "The Italian Job" (as a computer specialist in both). He was also in the films "Can't Hardly Wait", "Rat Race", "", "Without a Paddle" (alongside Matthew Lillard), "Idle Hands", "Party Monster", "Airborne", and "Old Dogs". 
In 1994, he starred alongside Jennifer Love Hewitt in the short-lived series "The Byrds of Paradise". The two additionally appeared in 1998's "Can't Hardly Wait". Green also had a role in the series "Buffy the Vampire Slayer". He played Daniel "Oz" Osbourne, a calm, mild-mannered member of the band Dingoes Ate My Baby who gets turned into a werewolf. The character was very popular among fans of the series. Green is not related to Bruce Seth Green, who directed some episodes of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer". On occasion, some sources confuse the two and have credited Seth as the director. As an actor in the series, he was close to co-star Alyson Hannigan because they were lovers in the show. Green has starred on Fox's "Greg the Bunny" and guest-starred on "The X-Files", "That '70s Show", "Will &amp; Grace", "MADtv", "Reno 911!", "Entourage", "Grey's Anatomy", "The Wonder Years", "Heroes", "The Facts of Life", "The Drew Carey Show", and "My Name Is Earl".
"Family Guy".
On the animated television comedy "Family Guy," Green primarily voices Chris Griffin, the teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent and, in many respects, a younger version of his father Peter Griffin. He also voices Neil Goldman, a neighbor of the Griffins. Green did an impression of Buffalo Bill from the thriller film "The Silence of the Lambs" during his audition. He has stated that his main inspiration for Chris' voice came from envisioning how Buffalo Bill would sound when speaking through a public address system at a McDonald's.
Howard the Duck.
Green provides the voice of Howard the Duck for the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films "Guardians of the Galaxy" (2014) and "Vol. 2" (2017) and the Disney+ animated series "What If...?", as well as the Disney XD animated series "Guardians of the Galaxy" (2015–2019) and "Ultimate Spider-Man" (2016).
Developing the character with James Gunn, Green did an impression of Danny DeVito, "being sort of a gruff and cynical sarcastic character [who] doesn't know what the Earth species of duck even is and doesn't think of himself that way and is offended by that generalization."
Later work.
Green is a co-creator, co-producer, writer, director, and most frequent voice of the Emmy-winning stop-motion sketch parody comedy TV series "Robot Chicken", for which he does many voices and has appeared in animated form. Green is friends with the band Fall Out Boy, making a cameo in their music video, "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race". He also appeared in "Weird Al" Yankovic's "White &amp; Nerdy" music video.

He is a producer of "The 1 Second Film" and appears in the "making of" documentary that accompanies its feature-length credits. Green is also the co-creator (with Hugh Sterbakov) of the comic "Freshmen", published by Top Cow Productions.
Green and "Robot Chicken" co-producer Breckin Meyer appeared in the NBC show "Heroes" during the 2008–09 season. In January 2009, Green worked with David Faustino (Bud Bundy from "Married... with Children") for an episode of Faustino's show "Star-ving" – Faustino is often mistaken for Green. Later in the same year, he worked with one of his idols, Robin Williams, in the comedy film "Old Dogs", which also starred John Travolta. On July 13, World Wrestling Entertainment's official website announced Green as the special guest host for the July 13 episode of "WWE Raw", and on that night, Green competed in the main event, a six-man tag team match, which his team won by disqualification. He was also in attendance for WWE's biggest event of the year, WrestleMania XXVI on March 28, 2010. Green guest-starred in the third season of the acclaimed sitcom "Husbands". Green became the new voice of Leonardo in "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" following Jason Biggs' departure from the role.
In 2019, he wrote and directed his first film named "Changeland", starring Brenda Song and Macaulay Culkin. The film was released on June 7, 2019.

Elmer Clifton

Elmer Clifton Forsyth (March 14, 1890 – October 15, 1949) was an American director, screenwriter, and actor from the early silent days.
Early life.
Elmer Clifton Forsyth was born in Toronto, Canada, to Cecil Carl Forsyth and Margaret Nicolle.
Career.
A collaborator of D.W. Griffith, Clifton appeared in "The Birth of a Nation" (1915) and "Intolerance" (1916) before giving up acting in 1917 to concentrate on work behind the camera, with Griffith and Joseph Henabery as his mentors. His first feature-length solo effort as a director was "The Flame of Youth" with Jack Mulhall. 
Clifton honed his talents during the late 1910s, directing vehicles for Mulhall and Herbert Rawlinson at Universal and then for Dorothy Gish for Famous Players–Lasky. Two of his projects with Gish, "Nobody Home" and "Nugget Nell", featured performances from pre-stardom Rudolph Valentino. Most of this early output has been lost. He was the first filmmaker to discover the talents of Clara Bow, whom he cast in "Down to the Sea in Ships", released on March 4, 1923. The independently produced film was well reviewed for its visual authenticity. 
During the 1920s, Clifton directed films for several different studios. During the filming of "The Warrens of Virginia" (1924) for Fox Film Corporation, lead actress Martha Mansfield suffered a fatal accident from burns when her costume caught fire. Clifton directed "The Wreck of the Hesperus" (1927) for Cecil B. deMille's production company, and filmed on location in the Grand Canyon for "The Bride of the Colorado". He also directed some Technicolor short films, including "Manchu Love" with an all-Asian cast.
He directed serials for Weiss Bros., Columbia, and Republic. His handling of the successful Columbia serial "The Secret of Treasure Island" (1938) earned him feature assignments at Columbia. During the 1940s Clifton was a staff director for PRC, working on action features and westerns. Like other silent-era veterans, he also worked in the low-budget "exploitation" field, directing "Gambling with Souls" (1936), "Assassin of Youth" (1937), "Slaves in Bondage" (1937), "City of Missing Girls" (1941), and "Youth Aflame" (1944). Clifton sometimes used the alias "Elmer S. Pond".
Clifton experienced a cerebral thrombosis three days into filming "Not Wanted" (1949), and was unable to work anymore. Producer Ida Lupino took over the direction and completed the film without screen credit. 
Clifton died in 1949 of a cerebral hemorrhage shortly after the film's release. Two of his 1949 productions, both inexpensive westerns produced by Raymond Friedgen, were released posthumously.
Personal life.
Clifton married actress Helen Kiely on November 29, 1926. The couple had three children: Actress Dorinda Clifton, a daughter named Patricia, and a son named Michael.

Palace Law

The Palace Law (, also spelled , ) is a class of legal texts in the history of Thailand, dating from the Ayutthaya period (14th–18th centuries). It prescribed the functions of the monarchy, royal court and government, probably serving like a constitution during early Ayutthaya. It was one of the 27 laws compiled in the 1805 Three Seals Code on the orders of King Rama I, following the fall of Ayutthaya.
Today, a handful of palace laws dating from the reign of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI, r. 1910–1925) remain in force, the most significant of which is the 1924 Palace Law of Succession, which is deferred to by the constitution.

Lamone

Lamone is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
Lamone is first mentioned in 854 as "Namonni". In 1295 it was mentioned as "Lamono".
A prehistoric stone bowl was discovered on San Zeno hill. The first records of the village record properties and feudal rights in Lamone in the 9th century. These rights were probably held by the Benedictine Abbey of St. Ambrose in Milan and Como Cathedral. In the 15th century, the Duke of Milan acquired some of these rights. Other landholders included; in 1423, the hospital of S. Maria of Lugano, the S. Giuseppe Hospital and in 1514, the monastery of Santa Maria del Carmelo in Piacenza. In 1529, the rights of San Giuseppe and the Monastery of Santa Maria del Carmelo transferred to the Laghi family of Lugano.
The parish of Lamone (which also included Cadempino) is acknowledged as an independent parish in 1468. In 1758 it was elevated to a provostship. The Church of S. Andrea is mentioned for the first time in 1468, but it is probably from the 12th to the 13th century. In 1612 and again in the 19th century it was rebuilt. The bell tower dates from the Roman era. Next to the Oratory of St. Zeno, from the late 15th century, are the remains of a hermitage from 854.
The grazing rights that Lamone and Cadempino shared in the alpine meadows of Traverno and Guzzala, were granted to Isone in 1507. centuries of border disputes with Cadempino were finally resolved in 1887. Formerly the inhabitants of the village lived on agriculture and from money sent back by emigrants. A mill is first mentioned in 1619. Between the 18th century and about 1950 there was a sawmill and a sand quarry at Valeggia. The bridge over the Vedeggio river in Ostarietta was built in 1806–12 when the Lugano-Cadenazzo road was built. The bridge connects Lamone with the major roads and residential area on the right bank of the river. The river was redirected and put into a channel between 1906 and 1911. The village train station was built in 1923. Most of the industrial and commercial enterprises are concentrated in this flat area, along the river and the highway. The industrial growth was responsible for a large increase in population between 1950 and 1970.

Ireland national football team (1882–1950)

The Ireland national football team () represented the island of Ireland in association football from 1882 until 1950. It was organised by the Irish Football Association (IFA), and is the fourth oldest international team in the world. It mainly played in the British Home Championship against England, Scotland and Wales. Though often vying with Wales to avoid the wooden spoon, Ireland won the Championship in 1914, and shared it with England and Scotland in 1903.
After the partition of Ireland in the 1920s, although the IFA's administration of club football was restricted to Northern Ireland, the IFA national team continued to select players from the whole of Ireland until 1950, and did not adopt the name "Northern Ireland" until 1954 in FIFA competition, and the 1970s in the British Home Championship. In 1924, a separate international team, organised by the Football Association of Ireland, fielded a team called Ireland, which now represents the Republic of Ireland.
History.
1800s.
On 18 February 1882, two years after the founding of the Irish FA, Ireland made their international debut against England, losing 0–13 in a friendly played at Bloomfield Park in Belfast, becoming the fourth international side ever to take the field. This result remains the record win for England and the record defeat for an Ireland team. The Irish line-up that day included Samuel Johnston, who at the age of 15 years and 154 days became the youngest international debutant, which was a record until Aníbal Zapicán Falco played for Uruguay in 1908 at the age of 15 years and nine days. On 25 February 1882 Ireland played their second international against Wales at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham and an equaliser from Johnston became Ireland's first ever goal, although Ireland went on to lose 1–7, the goal also saw Johnston became the youngest ever international goalscorer.
In 1884 Ireland competed in the inaugural British Home Championship and lost all three games. Ireland did not win their first game until 13 March 1887, a 4–1 win over Wales in Belfast. Between their debut and this game, they had a run of 14 defeats and 1 draw, the longest run without a win in the 19th century. Despite the end of this run, heavy defeats continued to blight Ireland's record, including 3 March 1888 when they lost 0–11 to Wales, and on 23 February 1901 when they lost 0–11 to Scotland. These losses, together with the initial loss to England still constitute the record wins held by each of the other home nation teams.
However, there were some brighter moments: on 7 February 1891 an Ireland team featuring Jack Reynolds and four-goal hero Olphert Stanfield defeated Wales 7–2, providing Ireland with their second win. Reynolds international performances attracted the interest of West Bromwich Albion who signed him in March 1891, however it was later discovered that Reynolds was actually English. On 3 March 1894 at the Solitude Ground in Belfast, after thirteen attempts Ireland finally avoided defeat to England, the team that included Fred Spiksley and Reynolds, who had since switched allegiances, Ireland gained a 2–2 draw. Goals from Stanfield and W.K. Gibson inspired Ireland to come back from 2–0 down to gain a 2–2 draw.
Lacking the strength in depth enjoyed by England and Scotland, Irish internationals of this era started younger and their careers lasted longer than their English or Scottish contemporaries. As a result, Ireland fielded both the youngest and oldest national teams during the 19th century. Samuel Johnston had led the way in the early 1880s. Then on 27 February 1886 Shaw Gillespie, at the age of 18, became the youngest goalkeeper of the 19th century. Both Olphert Stanfield and W.K. Gibson were only 17 when they made their debuts. Another 17-year-old debutant was future Worcestershire cricketer, George Gaukrodger. In Johnston, Gibson and Gaukrodger, Ireland also had three of the four youngest goalscorers in the 19th century. Stanfield would go on to win 30 caps for Ireland, making him the most capped international of the century.
British champions.
Ireland's greatest success on the football field came when they won the 1913–14 British Home Championship. However the foundations for that success had been laid over a decade earlier when Ireland had pioneered the use of national team coaches. The first time in the history of modern football that a national team had a coach was on 20 February 1897 when Billy Crone was in charge of the Ireland team that lost 6–0 to England, again for the wins against Wales on 19 February 1898, on 4 March 1899, Ireland was coached by Hugh McAteer, and on 24 February 1900 Robert Torrans coached Ireland for the game against Wales. In 1914 McAteer would return to coach Ireland to their greatest success.
In 1899 the IFA also changed its rules governing the selection of non-resident players. Before then the Ireland team selected its players exclusively from the Irish League, in particular the four Belfast-based clubs, Cliftonville, Distillery, Glentoran and Linfield. On 4 March 1899 for the game against Wales, McAteer included four Irish players based in England. The change in policy produced dividends as Ireland won 1–0. Three weeks later, on 25 March one of these four players, Archie Goodall, aged 34 years and 279 days, became the oldest player to score at international level during the 19th century when he scored in a 1–9 defeat to Scotland.
Goodall remained a regular at centre-half for Ireland until he was almost 40. On 28 March 1903, aged 38 years and 283 days, he scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win against Wales and became the oldest goalscorer in Ireland's history. The goal also helped an Ireland team, that also included Jack Kirwan, Billy Scott, Billy McCracken and Robert Milne, clinch a share in the 1902–03 British Home Championship. Until then the competition had been monopolised by England and Scotland. However, in 1903, before goal difference was applied, Ireland forced a three way share. Despite losing their opening game 0–4 to England, the Irish then beat Scotland for the first time with a 2–0 win at Celtic Park.
On 15 February 1913, with a team captained by Val Harris and including Billy Scott and two-goal hero Billy Gillespie, Ireland beat England for the first time with a 2–1 win at Windsor Park. In 1914 Ireland went a stage further and won the championship outright. Harris and Gillespie were joined in the squad by among others, Patrick O'Connell and Bill Lacey. Gillespie scored twice as Ireland beat Wales 2–1 away, Ireland then beat England 3–0 at Ayresome Park, Middlesbrough with Lacey grabbing two of the goals. They clinched the title following a 1–1 home draw with Scotland in what would be their last match until the end of the First World War.
Inter-war years.
Following the end of hostilities, the British Home Championship resumed in October 1919, opening with Ireland taking on England at Windsor Park. The championship winning team had since broken up, and in their first game, Ireland fielded eight debutants, and despite only losing one game in the first post war competition, they finished the tournament in last place.
Ireland never refound the form of their 1914 winning season, and only managed two second places in the following twenty years. However they did have a number of excellent match performance including beating England 2–1 at Windsor Park on 10 October 1923 with a team featuring Tom Farquharson, Sam Irving, Bobby Irvine and Billy Gillespie. During the 1920s, Billy Gillespie set the Irish FAs record of thirteen goals in an international career, of which seven of these came at the expense of England. Gillespie's record was eventually equalled by Colin Clarke in 1992 and broken by David Healy in 2004, thus holding the record for nearly 80 years.
Throughout Ireland's formative years they exclusively played against England, Scotland and Wales, both in friendlies and in the British Home Championship. However, in the 1920s there were occasions when Ireland played other teams, including France, Norway and South Africa, for various reasons, such as the number of amateur players involved, the status of these internationals has been disputed.
On 10 October 1927 Gillespie and Irving were joined by Elisha Scott as they defeated England 2–0 at Windsor Park, in the following match a defeat by Wales in Belfast put the championship beyond reach, however on 25 February 1928 an inspired goalkeeping performance from Scott helped Ireland defeat Scotland 1–0, their first win against the Scots in eighteen years, gaining the side their best season finish since 1914.
On 2 February 1930 Ireland beat Wales 7–0 with Joe Bambrick, playing at his home club ground scoring six of the seven goals. This remains the team's record win to this day, and Bambrick's six goals was the highest tally by any player in a single match in the history of the competition, and remains unequaled to this very day.
However Ireland spent the remainder of the decade in the bottom half of the table, only managing to avoid last place on three occasions. Following war breaking out in Europe, the British home championship was again suspended with Ireland finishing the 1938–39 competition where they had spent most of the last two decades, at the bottom of the table, having lost all their games.
Irish FA v FA of Ireland.
In 1920 Ireland was partitioned into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. In 1922, the south of Ireland gained independence as the Irish Free State, later to become Republic of Ireland. Amid these political upheavals, a rival football association, the Football Association of Ireland (the FAI), emerged in Dublin in 1921 and organised a separate league and later a national team. In 1923, during a period when the home nations had disaffiliated from the governing body, the FAI was recognised by FIFA as the governing body of the Irish Free State on the condition that it changed its name to the "Football Association of the Irish Free State". At the same time, the IFA continued to organise its national team on an all-Ireland basis, regularly calling up Free State players. During this era at least one Northerner, Harry Chatton, also played for the Irish Free State and from 1936, the FAI began to organise their own all–Ireland team. Both teams now competed as "Ireland" and during this era at least 39 dual internationals were selected to represent both teams. In an era when national teams played only a few games a year, it was rare for professional players to turn down an opportunity to play at international level.
Between 1928 and 1946 the IFA were not affiliated to FIFA and the two "Ireland" teams co-existed, never competing in the same competition. Only in 1949, they both would participate in the qualifying tournament for the 1950 World Cup.
End of the era.
During the Second World War all home internationals were suspended, however, during this period Ireland played an unofficial match against a combined services eleven, which was effectively a Great Britain side containing Matt Busby, Stanley Matthews, Tommy Lawton and Stan Mortensen. The game was a high scoring affair with Ireland losing 4–8, with all four Ireland goals coming from the future manager Peter Doherty. The performance of Doherty was such that the match commentator, Maurice Edelston, stated "He was almost a one-man team – and if Ireland had two Dohertys that day, I shudder to think what might have happened".
In 1946, when the Home Nations resumed official internationals, the IFA-FAI split was highlighted as England played both teams in the same week. The English FA requested each association to select only players from its jurisdiction, "quoting the International Federation rule to that effect". The FAI complied, but not the IFA, and two players from the 2–7 defeat in Belfast on 28 September played again in the 0–1 defeat in Dublin on 30 September. On 27 November, seven players born in the 26 counties, including Johnny Carey, Peter Farrell and Con Martin, played in the IFA side's 0–0 draw with Scotland. The draw helped the team finish as runners-up in the 1946–47 British Home Championship. From then until the 1949–50 season the IFA regularly selected five to seven players born in the Free State and were rewarded with some respectable results, including a 2–0 win against Scotland on 4 October 1947 and a 2–2 draw with England at Goodison Park on 5 November the same year.
The Irish FA, along with the other Home Nations, rejoined FIFA to compete in the World Cup; the 1949–50 British Home Championship was used as the qualifying group. Ireland hosted the first ever World Cup qualifier in which a home nation side competed, losing 2–8 to Scotland in Belfast, and eventually finishing bottom of the group only managing to take a point, away to Wales. During the match against Wales at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, the IFA fielded an all-Ireland team for the last time. The team included four players – Tom Aherne, Reg Ryan, Davy Walsh and the captain Con Martin – who were born in the Irish Free State, and all four of whom had previously played for the FAI international team in their qualifiers and as a result had played for two different associations in the same FIFA World Cup tournament.
The FAI took steps to prevent players from what was now the Republic of Ireland turning out for the IFA's Ireland team. All UK-based players from the Republic were pressured to sign an undertaking not to play for the IFA. Jackie Carey was the last to comply, in April 1950. Rule 35(b) of the FAI articles provided that players based in the Republic would be denied clearance certificates for transfers abroad unless they gave a similar undertaking. The IFA complained to FIFA; in April 1951, FIFA replied that the FAI rule 35(b) was contrary to its regulations, but also that the IFA team could not select "citizens of Eire". An exception was for British Home Championship games, as a 1923 IFAB agreement at Liverpool prevented FIFA intervention in relations between the four Home Nations. However, the exception would only apply "if the F.A. of Ireland do not object", and was never availed of.
IFA and FAI teams both continued to compete as "Ireland". At FIFA's 1953 congress, its Rule 3 was amended so that an international team must use "that title ... recognised politically and geographically of the countries or territories". The FAI initially claimed Rule 3 gave them the right to the name "Ireland" (see names of the Irish state), but FIFA subsequently ruled neither team could be referred to as "Ireland", decreeing that the FAI team be officially designated as the "Republic of Ireland", while the IFA team was to become "Northern Ireland". The IFA objected and in 1954 was permitted to continue using the name "Ireland" in Home Internationals, based on the 1923 agreement. This practice was discontinued in the late 1970s.
Home grounds.
Up until 1899 Ireland played all their home internationals in Belfast, with their first international being played at Bloomfield. Subsequent home games during the 1880s were played at the Ulster Cricket Ground, also known as "Ballynafeigh Park", the home of Ulster F.C. During the 1890s the Solitude Ground, the home stadium of Cliftonville, hosted 11 home internationals. In the early 20th century occasional internationals were also played at Grosvenor Park, the then home of Distillery, and the Balmoral Showgrounds.
On 17 March 1900, Saint Patrick's Day, Ireland played their first game in Dublin, losing 0–2 at Lansdowne Road to England. On 26 March 1904 Ireland played their first game at Dalymount Park in north Dublin, a 1–1 draw with Scotland. Between 1904 and 1913 Dalymount hosted at least one Irish international in the years when Ireland had more than one home match. The other games were played at Windsor Park, completed in 1905. After the partition of Ireland, all subsequent home internationals were played in Belfast, mainly at Windsor Park but occasionally at Celtic Park, the home of Belfast Celtic.
Team colours and emblems.
From the beginning Ireland wore a variety of colours, including green, white and blue. The first colours were "royal blue jerseys and hose and white knickers". St. Patrick's blue, however, emerged as the established colour from before the First World War until September 1931. Blue has been a national colour of Ireland since the Norman era and has been used by several other Irish sports teams, including Dublin GAA, Leinster Rugby and Dublin City. In 1931 the shirts were changed to green, the colour still worn by the modern Northern Ireland team. The official reason given for the change was to avoid a clash with Scotland, who also wore blue.
Ireland's initial logo was a stylised Celtic cross with a harp in the centre, which in a modern form is used by the current team, however this had been replaced in the 1930s until the 1950s with a Shamrock badge. This change occurred at a time when the IFA and the FAI were both using the Ireland name, and at this time the shamrock was also being worn by the FAI's national side.
Team selection.
"See "
Selection was the responsibility of a committee, with no individual manager in the modern sense. Coaches were appointed on a match by match basis, among them Billy Crone (1897), Hugh McAteer (1898, 1899, 1914) and Robert Torrans (1900).
Competitive record.
World Cup record.
During the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament, FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide "broken-time" payments to cover the expenses of players from the country who participated. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA. As a result, Ireland did not compete in the first three World Cup competitions.

Dynod Bwr

Dynod son of Pabo ( or "Dunod ap Pabo"; ; died c. 595), better known as Dynod the Stout () or Dynod Fawr was the ruler of a small kingdom in the North Pennines in the post-Roman Hen Ogledd ("Old North"). "Regio Dunutinga" was a minor kingdom or region in North Yorkshire mentioned in the "Life of Wilfrid". P.N. Wood identifies this with the area of Craven.
Dynod was a son of Pabo Post Prydain and is thought to have succeeded to his kingdom. He was the father of Saint Deiniol, founder of Bangor by Dwywai ferch Lleenog.
Dynod is mentioned in the Welsh Triads (TYP no.5) as one of the ‘Three Pillars of Battle’ of Ynys Prydain.
He is also mentioned in a poem on the death of Urien of Rheged. Llywarch Hen says: "Let savage Unhwch guide me; It was said in Drws Llech, ‘Dunod ap Pabo does not retreat.’" After the assassination of Urien, Dynod is said to have invaded his kingdom of Rheged, doing battle against Urien's sons Owain and Pascent. He is said to have died at the hands of the Bernician Angles around AD 595.
Dynod is often confused with the abbot Saint Dunod of Bangor Iscoed mentioned by Bede. Archaeologist Craig Cessford suggests that Dynod may be the same individual as the baby Dinogad referred to in the early medieval Welsh lullaby Dinogad's Smock.

Porza

Porza is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
Porza is first mentioned around 1297−99 as "Porza".
1907-08 several cremation graves along with grave goods from the Iron Age were discovered. During the Middle Ages the Benedictine abbey of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro owned land in Porza. On a hill northeast of Porza was Trevano castle, which was probably built in the 12th century by the Bishop of Como. It was owned by the Brocchi family, from Como and later by the Trevano and Quadri families. On the castle's foundations a villa was built in 1871. During the Belle Époque the glamorous and wealthy met here, and musicians from across Europe presented themselves to give concerts. In 1934, the district purchased the villa. It was demolished in 1961 and replaced with a school, which is now part of the Scuola universitaria professionale della Svizzera italiana (university of Italian Switzerland).
Porza's church was under the parish church S. Lorenzo in Lugano until 1468, followed by the parish of Comano. It became an independent parish in 1647. The Church of SS. Bernardino e Martino dates from the 16th century and was restored 1974.
Historically, the local economy relied on farming as well as craftsmen ("Maestranze") emigrating to other countries. At the beginning of the 21st century, it has become a residential community for the agglomeration of Lugano. Since the 1960s, a substantial proportion of the population comes from abroad or the rest of Switzerland. In the valley along the Cassarate river, an industrial and trade development zone has grown up. In 1992−95, a skating rink was built in Resega near the river. In 2000, about three-quarters of the workforce commutes.

Battle of the Styles

The Battle of the Styles is a term used to refer to the conflict between supporters of the Gothic style and the Classical style in architecture. In Britain this led to public debates between Decimus Burton and Augustus Pugin. 
Later in the century the revival of vernacular architecture led to an increasing palette of styles from which architects could choose, including Queen Anne style and "Tudorbethan" models. Numerous stylistic options led to a debate about prefabricated stylistic options in architecture, which eventually mutated into the Arts and Crafts style and then into Modernism.

Bottling (concert abuse)

Bottling is an action where a concert audience throws various objects at the performers onstage. This generally happens at festivals when one act in the lineup is of a different genre or audience from the rest of the bands, especially festivals where the majority of bands are related to heavy metal and punk rock music styles.
While bottling generally involves empty or full bottles of water, it is also common for bottles to contain urine. Other items, such as garden furniture, mud, fireworks, broken glass, shoes, dead animals, and molotov cocktails (unlighted and lighted), have also been recorded as thrown items.
Below is a list of bottling incidents by decade and year.
2020s.
2021.
On October 16, 2021, University of Tennessee fans threw bottles and other objects, including a golf ball which hit Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin, onto the Neyland Stadium field after the Tennessee Volunteers were ruled to have been stopped short on fourth down with 54 seconds remaining. The game was delayed some 20 minutes. The Rebels defeated the Vols, 31–26. The commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, Greg Sankey, announced the following Monday that the University of Tennessee would be fined $250,000 for its fans' bottling.
In fiction.
The title characters were bottled in a pivotal scene in "The Blues Brothers", famously only protected by a mesh of chicken wire.

Bill Ritchie

Bill Ritchie (1 August 1931 – 25 January 2010) was a Scottish cartoonist. He is known for work on comics published by D. C. Thomson.
Biography.
Born in Glasgow, Ritchie attended the Glasgow School of Art, where he learnt little about cartoons or comics; instead, he taught himself by practising from local comics artists Jack Lindsay, Bud Neill, Jimmy Malcolm, Harry Smith and Bill Tait. It was Malcolm who suggested he try to draw comics for D. C. Thomson in Dundee. While serving in the army in Korea, he submitted his first cartoons to the publisher, which were printed in "The Weekly News".
His first comic strip was "Clumsy Claude" in "The Beano", and for many years he drew "Baby Crockett" in the "Beezer". Between 1957 and 1964 Ritchie drew the illustrations for "The Glad Mag" an annual magazine produced by students of Queen's College, Dundee as part of their charities campaign. Copies of these magazines are held by University of Dundee Archive Services.
After his retirement in the 1990s, his comics were "ghosted" by other artists.
He died on 25 January 2010.

David L. Norton

David Lloyd Norton (March 27, 1930 – July 24, 1995) was an American philosopher. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri, March 27, 1930, to Cecil V. Norton and (Adelene) Ruth Essick Norton. He was the brother of Douglas C. Norton (born 1945) of Norton's Fine Art in St. Louis.
Studies, family and early career.
Norton earned a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis in 1952. In 1953 he married Joan Marie Carter of Webster Groves, Missouri, and in 1954 their first child, Anita Lee Norton (later Kronsberg) was born. During these years Norton also served as Associate Leader of the St. Louis Ethical Society. He and his wife lost an infant daughter, Nancy Ann, to crib death (or sudden infant death syndrome) in 1959. In 1961 Norton and his wife adopted an infant son, whom they named Ronald Vallet Norton.
After working as a civil engineer in California, Norton returned to Washington University to study philosophy, earning a Master's degree in 1962. He then took up doctoral work at Boston University, earning his Ph.D. in 1968. While in Boston, Norton served as Leader of the Boston Ethical Society. His second son, Peter, was born in Boston in 1963. His dissertation was "Transcendental Imagination: A Post-Kantian Appraisal."
In 1966 Norton moved with his family to Newark, Delaware, to serve on the faculty of the University of Delaware's philosophy department. Shortly thereafter he divorced and remarried. He fathered two more sons, Tucker (b. 1971) and Cory (b. 1976).
Philosophy.
Norton taught at the University of Delaware for 29 years. In 1976 Princeton University Press published his book "Personal Destinies: A Philosophy of Ethical Individualism," which received wide notice. His next book, "Democracy and Moral Development," was published by the University of California Press in 1991. In 1995 Norton succumbed quickly to cancer, dying July 24. His final book, "Imagination, Understanding, and the Virtue of Liberality," published by Rowman and Littlefield, appeared soon after.
In the last of the works listed above, Norton summarized his three books' related purposes. In "Personal Destinies," he "addressed the fundamental moral question, What is a worthy life for a human being?" In "Democracy and Moral Development," he took up "the inescapable correlative, What is a good society?" Finally, in "Imagination, Understanding, and the Virtue of Liberality," Norton asked "what kind of world can productively accommodate a plurality of good societies?" and identified the traits of character required of individuals who would promote it.
As an academic philosopher, Norton devoted attention to the fundamental and practical problems of the life well lived. For his inspiration Norton turned chiefly to the Greeks, and especially to the dialogues of Plato. He called himself an ethical individualist, seeing a harmony between the individual's fidelity to his own "personal destiny" and the fulfillment of society's collective needs. He held that within each person is an innate potentiality (his "daimon," or soul), and that each person's life task is to discover it and actualize it. This conviction shaped Norton's views on the distinct purposes of each of life's stages, on the proper roles of parents and schools, and on the best social and political arrangements.
In a late essay, Norton put his philosophy in succinct terms: "There is a distinctive course of life that is right for each individual, amid countless possibilities. This is the individual's vocation, variously termed his or her 'genius,' 'daimon,' 'Buddha nature,' or 'atman.' It consists in innate potentialities that predispose persons to a particular direction in life. As distinguished from other possibilities, the actualization by an individual of his or her potentialities affords intrinsic rewards to that person—that is, the activity is personally fulfilling and satisfying. Self-knowledge, then, is knowledge of the activities, situations, and relationships that the individual experiences as intrinsically rewarding. Engaged at these, the individual invests the best of himself or herself and strives continuously to improve, while in the process contributing objective values to others." ["Education for Self-Knowledge and Worthy Living," in Howie and Schedler, eds., "Ethical Issues in Contemporary Society" (Southern Illinois University Press, 1995)].
Norton's own philosophy recognized "duplicity" as a "hallmark of human nature," and saw in it the ultimate threat to the life well lived ("Personal Destinies," ch. 1). The epigraph to "Personal Destinies"' is an appeal from Socrates to unite "the outward and inward man." As Norton wrote in 1976, "Philosophy will sometimes present an individual with features of his acts and principles that horrify him, producing in him an exchange of principles and patterns of behavior" ("Personal Destinies," "Unscholarly Epilogue").
Quotations.
• "In pre-Hellenic Greece, sculptors made busts of the semi-deity Silenus that had a trick to them. Inside the hollow clay likeness was hidden a golden figurine, to be revealed when the bust was broken open. ... Each person is a bust of Silenus containing a golden figurine, his daimon. The person's daimon is an ideal of perfection—unique, individual, and self-identical. It is neither the actual person nor a product of the actual person, yet it is fully real, affording to the actual person his supreme aim and establishing the principle by which the actual person can grow in identity, worth, and being." —"Personal Destinies," ch. 1.
• "From the humanistic standpoint a philosophy that seeks converts is a contradiction in terms. The function of humanistic philosophy is not to impose invented forms upon human life, but to elicit and clarify the forms the lives of persons implicitly possess." —"Personal Destinies," "Unscholarly Epilogue."
• "Those who accepted classical liberalism's invitation also incurred great costs, for with it they accepted an economistic conception of self and society that has by its moral minimalism rendered invisible the large demands and rewards of worthy living." —"Democracy and Moral Development," ch. 7.
• Autonomy is not "total self-sufficiency" but "the entitlement of each interactive entity to determine for itself what its contributions to others will be and, likewise, to determine for itself what use it will make of the self-determined contributions of other entities." —"Imagination, Understanding, and the Virtue of Liberality," ch. 4.

Hoo Junction

Hoo Junction is a rail yard on the North Kent Line, near the village of Higham, Kent and Shorne Marshes, operated by DB Cargo UK; formerly the "English, Welsh and Scottish Railway". It is between Gravesend and Higham stations, at the junction with the freight-only single-track Hoo branch to the Hoo Peninsula.
Layout.
There are up and down yards on either side of the main line, with the single-track Grain branch line entering from the north east.
The up yard (south of the main line) consists of 14 sidings and three through roads, with other ancillary sidings. The down yard (north of the main line) consists of 10 sidings and three through roads. Some sidings in the down yard have been taken up.
As part of Phase 1 of the Kent Coast Electrification Scheme, the yard at Hoo Junction had a simple overhead catenary system installed in 1959, to accommodate the Class 71 electric locomotives then brought into use. These were equipped with a pantograph to work off the catenary, intended to avoid the exposed third rail which could have added a danger for yard staff. Due to introduction of diesel-electric locomotives the catenary system had become redundant by 1975.
Westinghouse Rail Systems has buildings adjacent to the north perimeter of the yard.
Traffic.
The yard re-marshals wagon traffic on the main line and from the branch. The majority of traffic is aggregate wagons, with steel strip carriers are also present. Infrastructure units and ballast trains also use the yard. Container traffic from Thamesport used to pass through but this flow ceased around 2014 when the larger container shipping lines started using Thames Gateway instead of Thamesport.
Staff halt.
Hoo Junction Staff Halt opened in 1956 in the yard, which it was built to serve. The down platform was on the main line before the junction with the branch, at TQ 6950 7369 , while the up platform was only on the main line, at TQ 6980 7364 . This station had an hourly service, which was advertised as being "for staff purposes only".
The station has been closed and demolished.

Clough River

The Clough River is a river in Cumbria, England. A tributary of the River Rawthey, it flows for primarily through the Garsdale valley.
Course.
The river rises at Grisedale in south-eastern Cumbria, where a group of smaller streams draining Grisedale Pike converge as Grisedale Beck. The young Clough River then goes through a short valley (Grisedale, "The Dale That Died"), and over a waterfall before being named Clough at Clough Farm, Garsdale Head, where it enters Garsdale, a valley formed by the river between Baugh Fell (to the north) and Rise Hill (to the south).
The Clough is mainly shallow and rocky, with occasional pools large enough for swimming, though the water is always cold. The A684 (Northallerton to Kendal) road follows the river for seven miles with frequent bridges in the upper part of the dale. At Longstone Fell the main (former turnpike) road rises to a well-known view-point looking over the Howgill Fells, and the river descends to Danny Bridge, the site of a seventeenth-century mill on the “old road”, before merging with the River Rawthey at Dowbiggin Foot near Sedbergh, and joining the River Lune at Middleton Bridge. 
In 1985 a geological walk, the Sedgwick Trail, named after the well-known geologist Adam Sedgwick (1785-1873), was opened. It runs along the Clough from Danny Bridge and highlights rock features along the Dent Fault.
The ancient county through which the Clough River runs is the West Riding of Yorkshire, and it is still part of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, though its entire length is now within the Westmorland and Furness district of Cumbria.

Leo Willis

Leo Willis (January 5, 1890 – April 10, 1952) was an American actor who began his career in the silent era. He played mainly tough guys and comic villains, notably opposite Harold Lloyd, Charley Chase, and Laurel and Hardy at the Hal Roach Studios.
Early life and career.
Born in Wapanucka, Oklahoma, Willis was the son of Joe Willis and Margurate Holdebery.
Regarding Willis's third film, the 1916 William S. Hart western "The Return of Draw Egan", the "Nashville Tennessean" singled out as one of the film's principal "thrill[s]" a fight staged between the star and Willis, whom the paper dubs "one of Inceville's strongest men." Willis again figured prominently, this time alongside fellow villain Thomas Kurihara, in Hart's followup western, "The Devil's Double".
"The Philadelphia Inquirer", in its contemporaneous review of Harold Lloyd's 1927 comedy "The Kid Brother", states that Walter James, Willis, and Olin Francis, in their respective portrayals of the hero's father and two older brothers, "create a new standard of character work in a feature-length comedy," a point echoed by "New-York Tribune" critic Harriette Underhill, who characterized the trio's work as "singularly earnest [and] without exaggeration for a work of this sort."
Beginning in 1927, the final decade of Willis's screen career featured appearances—mostly in minor roles—in 11 films alongside Laurel and Hardy, including a pair, "Call of the Cuckoo" and "Flying Elephants", in which the two appeared together prior to becoming a full-fledged team, as well as his final role, in the 1936 Charlie Chase short, "On the Wrong Trek", in which the famous team makes only a cameo appearance.
Personal life and death.
Willis was married to May Frances Hennessey from June 1914 until her death on September 17, 1926. They had two daughters.
On April 10, 1952, at age 62, Willis died in his sleep at his home in King City, California.

Pura, Switzerland

Pura is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
Pura is first mentioned around 751–760, though this is found in a 17th-century copy of the original.
In the Middle Ages several institutions such as the monastery of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia, Como Cathedral, Disentis Abbey and the monastery of Agno possessed property or land in Pura.
The village was part of the Agno parish until 1603 when it became a separate parish. The parish church of San Martino was first mentioned in 1352. It was rebuilt in 1580 and expanded between 1642 and 1658.
The village economy was based mainly on agriculture, livestock and the dairy industry. The dairy cooperative opened in 1890. Due to limited farming land many of the residents emigrated in the 19th century. The majority of them went to Italy to work as brickmakers. In the 1960s, a strong construction boom began. By 2000, approximately three quarters of the working population are commuters, especially to Lugano.

We Can't Be Friends

"We Can't Be Friends" is a song by Canadian singer Deborah Cox, featuring American singer RL of R&amp;B group Next. It was written by Shep Crawford and Jimmy Russell for her second studio album "One Wish" (1998), while production was overseen by Crawford. Selected as the album's third single, the duet was airplayed on December 21, 1998 but released on September 14, 1999, and became her second single to reach number one on the "Billboard" Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, while peaking at number eight on the "Billboard" Hot 100.
Critical reception.
Chuck Taylor from "Billboard" wrote that "Cox shows off the full maturity of her magnificent voice in this shimmering R&amp;B ballad, which she
shares with the equally compelling R.L. from Next. From the start, this beautifully crafted song of regret and abiding love glides along with the gentle touch of silk, raising the emotional threshold at the mid-section, where the pair’s voices rally together as if made for each other." He found that "while Cox has certainly delivered the goods on the classic "Things Just Ain't the Same" and "Nobody's Supposed to Be Here," this casts her in a completely new light, which R&amp;B and R&amp;B adult stations will eagerly savor with all the intensity of the emotion shared here. This is indeed the goods."

Nicky Bailey

Nicky Francis Bailey (born 10 June 1984) is an English retired professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He has played for the England C national team.
Club career.
Early career and Barnet.
Bailey, born in Putney, London, began his career with local team Fulham but was released and moved to non-league Sutton United where he played as a teenager. At twenty, he went to Conference side Barnet in 2004 for a tribunal fee of £10,000.
Bailey was Paul Fairclough's first signing as Barnet manager, and he immediately established himself as a regular for the club.
Bailey made his Barnet debut against Farnborough Town in a 0–0 draw in the Football Conference on 17 August 2004, and scored his first goal for the club on 4 September 2004 in a 5–1 win against Morecambe. He helped the club to promotion in the 2004–05 season and then establish itself in Football League Two over the following two years. In 2006-7 he was voted Barnet FC Player of the Season by the club's supporters.
Southend United.
After attracting interest from several clubs during the January transfer window, it was announced on 29 June 2007 that Bailey was discussing terms with Southend United of League One. He eventually signed with Southend on 3 July 2007 for a fee of £175,000. After winning the club's player of the year award for the 2007–08 season, Bailey was transfer listed on 5 June 2008 after failing to agree to terms over a contract extension. He signed with Charlton Athletic on a three-year contract for a fee that could reach £750,000 in August 2008, seeking championship football and a higher wage, a move that has made him unpopular with Southend fans.
Charlton Athletic.
Charlton Athletic were relegated from the championship after finishing at the bottom of the table, despite Bailey finishing as top scorer. He was voted the club's player of the season.
On 26 April 2010 it was announced that Bailey was in the 2009–10 PFA team of the year alongside teammate Frazer Richardson. Bailey captained Charlton to a semi-final playoff defeat against Swindon Town, the semi-final went to penalties and it was Bailey who missed the decisive spot kick for Charlton to send Swindon through to the final. It was to be his last kick as a Charlton player.
Middlesbrough.
On 19 June 2010 the BBC claimed that Middlesbrough F.C. were set to sign Bailey for a fee of £1.4m. The deal was confirmed by both clubs on 24 June 2010, and Bailey was officially announced as a Middlesbrough player on 8 July. Bailey had a difficult start as a Middlesbrough player, however under new manager Tony Mowbray, Bailey was converted to a more defensive minded midfielder and became popular with the fans. His ongoing impressive form led to Bailey being nominated for the Championship player of the month in December 2011.
Bailey scored his first goal for Middlesbrough against Burnley on 10 September 2011. Bailey then scored again in Middlesbrough's 2–1 home win against Southampton. Bailey scored on 21 August 2012, his third goal for Boro, again against Burnley in a 3–2 home win. Following injuries to Rhys Williams and Jonathan Woodgate, Bailey captained Boro three times in the 2012–13 season. Bailey's fourth Boro goal was a spectacular long shot in a 2–1 home defeat to Leicester City. At the end of the 2012–13 season Bailey's contract expired.
Millwall.
Bailey joined Millwall on a two-year deal in July 2013. He suffered numerous injuries during his two years with the club, limiting him to 39 appearances. He was released at the end of the 2014–15 season following Millwall's relegation to League One.
Barnet.
Bailey started training with Barnet in October 2015, and re-signed on a short-term deal later in the month. On 23 December, Bailey was released after only four appearances.
Sutton United.
At the end of his contract with Barnet, Bailey re-signed for Sutton United, initially until the end of the 2015–16 season. In his second spell at Sutton, Bailey made his first league appearance in a 2–0 away victory against Chelmsford City on 30 January 2016. He made a total of nine full and seven substitute appearances for the U's, helping them win the National League South title.
Bailey agreed to stay with Sutton for the 2016–17 season, playing in the National League, and scored the first goal in his new spell at the club by converting a penalty against Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn on 9 August 2016, a game which ended in a 1–1 draw. After a string of impressive performances, Sutton supporters unofficially voted Bailey player of the month for August. Having converted two further penalties, one in a victory over Torquay United on 16 August and the other a consolation in a 2–1 defeat to Braintree Town on 13 September, Bailey scored his first goal for Sutton from open play on 8 October when he finished a corner supplied by Ross Stearn in a 4–1 rout of Surrey rivals Woking at Gander Green Lane. On 19 October 2016, it was announced that Bailey had signed a one-year contract extension with Sutton United and will stay with the club until the end of the 2017–18 season.
Bailey appeared for Sutton during their historic run to the 5th round of the FA Cup for the first time ever, including a 1–0 victory over Championship club Leeds United on 29 January 2017 and 0–2 defeat to Premier League club Arsenal on 20 February, where he made more tackles and interceptions than any other player.
On 4 March, Bailey was instrumental in helping Sutton to secure their first away clean sheet back in the non-League top flight, a 0–0 draw at Barrow, since a 9–0 away victory against Gateshead on 22 September 1990. Bailey featured the following day in The Non-League Paper's team of the day. Across three and a half seasons, Bailey played 125 times for Sutton in his second spell, scoring nine goals.
Later career.
Bailey followed Sutton manager Paul Doswell to Havant &amp; Waterlooville for the 2019–20 season. He joined Gosport Borough on 19 September 2020. In September 2021 he joined Cray Wanderers.
International career.
Bailey was picked to play for the England C national team, by Paul Fairclough when he was also manager of Barnet. He made four appearances before moving into the Football League, which meant he could no longer take part.

Semaphorin

Semaphorins are a class of secreted and membrane proteins that were originally identified as axonal growth cone guidance molecules. They primarily act as short-range inhibitory signals and signal through multimeric receptor complexes. Semaphorins are usually cues to deflect axons from inappropriate regions, especially important in the neural system development. The major class of proteins that act as their receptors are called plexins, with neuropilins as their co-receptors in many cases. The main receptors for semaphorins are plexins, which have established roles in regulating Rho-family GTPases. Recent work shows that plexins can also influence R-Ras, which, in turn, can regulate integrins. Such regulation is probably a common feature of semaphorin signalling and contributes substantially to our understanding of semaphorin biology.
Every semaphorin is characterised by the expression of a specific region of about 500 amino acids called the sema domain.
Semaphorins were named after the English word "Semaphore", which originated from Greek, meaning "sign-bearer".
Classes.
The Semaphorins are grouped into eight major classes based on structure and phylogenetic tree analyses. The first seven are ordered by number, from class 1 to class 7. The eighth group is class V, where V stands for virus. Classes 1 and 2 are found in invertebrates only, whilst classes 3, 4, 6, and 7 are found in vertebrates only. Class 5 is found in both vertebrates and invertebrates, and class V is specific to viruses.
Classes 1 and 6 are considered to be homologues of each other; they are each membrane bound in invertebrates and vertebrates, respectively. The same applies to classes 2 and 3; they are both secreted proteins specific to their respective taxa.
Each class of Semaphorin has many subgroups of different molecules that share similar characteristics. For example, Class 3 Semaphorins range from SEMA3A to SEMA3G.
In humans, the genes are: 
Semaphorin receptors.
Different semaphorins use different types of receptors:
Functions.
Semaphorins are versatile ligands. Their discovery was in regards to axon guidance in the limb buds of grasshoppers in 1992, but since then, it has been discovered that semaphorins have a role in many processes. They not only guide axons in development, but also have major roles in immune function (classes 4, 6, and 7) and the development of bones. Class 3 semaphorins are one of the most versatile semaphorin classes, in which Sema3a is the most studied.
During development, semaphorins and their receptors may be involved in the sorting of pools of motor neurons and the modulation of pathfinding for afferent and efferent axons from and to these pools. For instance, Sema3a repels axons from the dorsal root ganglia, facial nerves, vagal nerves, olfactory-sensory, cortical nerves, hippocampal nerves and cerebellar nerves.
Class 3 semaphorins have an important function after traumatic central nervous system injuries, such as spinal cord injury. They regulate neuronal and non-neuronal cells associated with the traumatic injury due to their presence in the scar tissue. Class 3 semaphorins modulate axonal regrowth, re-vascularisation, re-myelination and the immune response after central nervous system trauma.

<doc id="6967338" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6967338" title="Election Commission of Thailand">
Election Commission of Thailand

The Election Commission (, ) is an independent government agency and the sole election management body of Thailand. It oversees government elections (parliamentary elections and local elections) as well as referendums throughout the Kingdom of Thailand. Established by the 1997 constitution, the Election Commission (EC) has extensive powers to manage, oversee, and regulate the electoral process. The EC has reacted to irregularities in the 2000 Senate elections, the 2006 House elections, and the 2007 House elections, forcing re-elections and disqualifying many candidates. Election Commission is heavily criticized for untrustworthy and unprofessional practice during 2023 election, some critics are expected that the commission itself is under the influence of the military and orchestrated election fraud itself.
Roles and responsibilities.
The primary role of the commission is to ensure that elections carried out in the Kingdom of Thailand are lawful and compatible with the constitution. It is also in charge of enforcing national election laws covering: House of Representatives, Senate, Districts, Referendums, Bangkok gubernatorial elections and political parties. Its constitutional duty includes the publication of all election returns, therefore formalizing them. The commissioners also have the right to disqualify a candidate, or call for a re-count for a particular seat.
The EC's responsibilities include the organization, management, and counting of all elections and voting in the kingdom. It advises the National Assembly on future policies concerning elections and suffrage. The commission has legal powers as a law enforcement agency to investigate and indict those who compromise election laws through bribery, corruption, vote buying, or blackmail. The commission has the power to investigate the finances and donor lists of all political parties. It informs the public of elections and their importance.
Budget.
In FY2019, the EC is allocated 8,247 million baht, more than tripling from the FY2018 budget of 2,265 million baht due to national elections in 2019.
Structure.
The Election Commission of Thailand is composed of a committee of five members, one chairman () and four election commissioners (). The administrative side of the commission is run by the secretary-general (). As well as being regular members of the commission, the five members are also given various responsibilities. All commissioners are appointed by the king, with the advice of the Senate of Thailand; for a term of seven years. The current commission is the fourth team of election commissioners, appointed 12 August 2018.
History.
Prior to 1992, the responsibility of overseeing elections fell on the Ministry of Interior or Mahatthai Ministry. Under the premiership of Anand Panyarachun after the Thai general election of 1992, the prime minister realised the need to create a central and independent body, whose sole purpose was to regulate and manage elections. As a result, on 22 March 1992 the "Committee to Administer and Investigate Elections to the House of Representatives" () was created, a precursor of the commission. The commission in its current form was created by the 1997 constitution of Thailand.
2006 House election.
The Thai general election of 2006, was held on 9 April for the House of Representatives and 19 April for the Senate. The main opposition parties, composed of the Democrat Party, the Chart Thai Party, and the Mahachon Party, boycotted the election on the grounds that Thaksin Shinawatra's government had unfairly called an election to divert public attention form the Shin Corp scandal. Despite this, the election went ahead.
On 3 April 2006, the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) petitioned the Administrative Court to suspend the results of the election and accused the Election Commission of violating voter privacy. It accused the commission of placing voting booths so that voters' backs were to the public, when in all previous elections, voters faced the public, with a barrier one-half meter tall at the front of the booth separating the voter from the public. The commission claimed the new arrangement was designed to prevent various forms of polling fraud including the use of cameras by voters to take photographs of their ballots. After the 2005 election, cameras and camera phones were banned from voting stations due to fears that canvassers would demand ballot photographs in return for money. However, the PAD claimed that this allowed onlookers to peek over voters' shoulders and see who they voted for.
The elections were eventually declared invalid by Thailand's Constitutional Court, which found the positioning of voting booths violated voter privacy. The Constitutional Court forced the Election Commission to resign over its management of the April elections. The court failed to persuade the EC president to resign. It did, however, prevent the Senate from appointing a replacement for commissioner Jaral Buranapansri, who had died. This prevented the commission from achieving a quorum. It later found the remaining commissioners guilty of malfeasance and jailed them for one night. An entirely new commission was appointed.
2007 House election.
A number of MPs (mainly those elected for the PPP) were given "red cards" for alleged vote buying, meaning they would not be able to contest the resulting by-elections. Other MPs were issued "yellow cards" and not banned from contesting the by-elections. By 3 January 2008, the Election Commission had endorsed 397 MPs and was still investigating 83 MPs for fraud.
By-elections were held on 13 January, 17 January, 20 January (the day before the first session of the newly elected parliament) and 27 January 2008. The Electoral Commission was still looking into allegations of fraud by PPP deputy leader Yongyuth Tiyaphairat. If given a red card, the PPP faced dissolution. PPP officials stated that they are not worried about dissolution, and that they would simply find a new party instead; local reports stated that a likely candidate for takeover by PPP members would be the Thai Land Power Party ("Palang Pandin Thai Party").
Disqualified were:
2008 Senate election.
No major event occurred.
2011 General election.
On 19 July, both Yingluck Shinawatra and Abhisit Vejjajiva were acknowledged as members of the House. On 27 July, the acknowledgement extended to further ninety four elected candidates. Now and eventually, the number acknowledged sufficed to constitute the House. This, however, did not include Jatuporn Prompan whom the Election Commission declared to have lost the suffrage due to failure to vote in both the previous and the present elections. The Constitution requires that a member of the House must possess the suffrage, and also prescribes that a person failing to vote in an election loses the suffrage but regains it once voting in the next election.

Twilight Dancers

Twilight Dancers is the last installment of director Mel Chionglo and writer Ricky Lee's trilogy about Macho Dancers. The first part was "" in 1994, and the second part was "Burlesk King" in 1999. The trilogy took inspiration from Lino Brocka's film "Macho Dancer" in 1988.
Plot.
Twilight Dancers offers a disturbing yet a humorous look at the country's social realities through the eyes of three macho dancers or male strippers.
One of them is Dwight (Tyron Perez), young and at the peak of his trade, who loses the girl he loves to a politician's son. Then there is Alfred, who at 28 is past his prime and is kicked out of the club. Finally is Bert, 30, who has long since given up dancing and is now the bodyguard-driver of a corrupt businesswoman. But Bert's boss, Madame Loca (Cherry Pie Picache), manipulates the events that push the three dancers to fight for survival, and to finally confront issues of love, friendship and betrayal.
Adding to these conflicts are a deaf-mute wife who refuses to go back to her macho dancer husband, a director who keeps promising stardom to a male dancer named Michael (Terence Baylon), a transvestite performer who fakes being a virgin as well, a tyrannical mayor who cross-dresses at his birthday party, and a union leader who gets shot by an assassin in broad daylight.
But as their club's manager Taurus always says, "They are only here to serve the carnal desires of men. The show has to go on." "Twilight Dancers" is the third movie from director Mel Chionglo about Philippine's macho dancer industry.

William Bernard Ziff Sr.

William Bernard Ziff Sr. (August 1, 1898 – December 20, 1953) was an American publishing executive and author.
Early life.
By 1916, Ziff was working as an artist. He would later go on to serve as an aviator in World War I.
Ziff Davis Inc..
Ziff and Bernard G. Davis founded the magazine publisher Ziff Davis Inc. in 1927. After his death, in 1953, his son, Bill Ziff Jr., succeeded him at Ziff Davis.
Political views.
Being of Jewish ancestry and motivated by the power of Nazi Germany during the 1930s, Ziff became one of the most prominent American endorsers of Revisionist Zionism. During 1935, he was persuaded by devotees of the Revisionist Zionist spokesman Ze'ev Jabotinsky to accept the presidency of the Zionist-Revisionists of America organization although he resigned after one year, being uncomfortable with his role as a Jewish organizational official. Ziff remained active with Zionist politics and caused controversy when he authored during 1938 a criticism of British policy in the Holy Land entitled "The Rape of Palestine." The British Foreign Office declared the book "violent and offensive" and monitored Ziff thereafter.
The studied gentility of the upper-bracket Arab leaves little to be desired. Dressed in his "Abaye" and red "tarbush" he is a colorful figure. His bearing is languorous and courtly, in vivid contrast to the direct speech and often uncouth manners of the immigrant Jew. Beneath this thin stratum, the balance of the Arab population is primitive in the extreme. For the most part it can hardly be said that they have risen above the stage of barbarism. They are, on the whole, of poor physical type and of low mentality. It would be hard to pose a wider disparity of
culture, instinct and mind than lies between these people and the returning Hebrew.In March 1946, Ziff spoke at a rally of 20,000 participants in Madison Square Garden protesting against Britain's recent reversal of its pro-Zionist policies in Mandatory Palestine.
Personal life.
On July 25, 1923, he married Denea Fischer (1902–1993); together, they had one daughter and later divorced. Ziff married Amelia Mary Morton (1903–1980) with whom he had three children.

I'll Sleep When You're Dead

I'll Sleep When You're Dead is the second solo studio album by American hip hop artist El-P. It was released through Definitive Jux on March 20, 2007. It peaked at number 78 on the "Billboard" 200 chart, selling about 11,000 copies in its first week. Music videos were created for "Flyentology" and "Smithereens".
Production.
Despite his usual dislike of "records that have a bunch of (featuring so and so) after every song title", El-P has explained the more organic nature of the collaborations on "I'll Sleep When You're Dead":
El-P has compared the overall sound of the album's music to "a psychedelic Boogie Down Productions record", and like "Scott LaRock and Ced Gee take acid".
The bird on the album's cover is based on a drawing that Alexander Calder made on a wooden toy airplane for El-P as a child.
Critical reception.
At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, "I'll Sleep When You're Dead" received an average score of 80 based on 32 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
John Bush of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it "one of the most powerful hip-hop albums of 2007." Dave Heaton of "PopMatters" gave the album 8 stars out of 10, saying: "The genius of "I'll Sleep When You're Dead" -- and the reason it deserves to be considered as a progressive step in El-P's journey as an artist -- is that the tracks are just as dense and complex as on his other albums, but in a new, fresh way." Andy Battaglia of "The A.V. Club" gave the album a grade of B, saying, "nobody makes hip-hop as textured and atmospheric as El-P, and he manages to temper his disorienting noise with soulful suggestions this time out."
"Consequence of Sound" placed it at number 42 on the "Top 50 Albums of 2007" list.

Germán Efromovich

Germán Efromovich (born 1950) is a Bolivian-born entrepreneur with multiple citizenship: Brazilian, Colombian, and Polish. He was born into a family of Polish Jews. His net worth is estimated to be $1 billion.
Biography.
Efromovich was born in La Paz, but his family is originally from Poland. Looking for a new home after World War II, his parents left Poland for South America, first to Bolivia, where he was born, and later to Chile, where Germán Efromovich was raised from 1955 in Arica and then from 1964 in São Paulo, Brazil. After schooling, he earned a degree in Mechanical Engineering from FEI University in Brazil. His career includes selling encyclopedias, dubbing Mexican movies into Portuguese and the ownership of a school in São Bernardo do Campo, where in the 1980s he taught a union leader named Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who later became President of Brazil.
The oil sector laid the groundwork for what would become Synergy Group. To build his oil and aviation empire Efromovich bought Avianca, Colombia's national airline, in 2004, for US$64m, plus the assumption of US$220 million in debt and leasing liabilities. Initially performing only nondestructive testing for the Brazilian-government-run oil company, Petrobras, Efromovich developed more business to the point of building and leasing oil rigs. His other businesses include power plants, shipyards and products for the medical industry.
After the sinking of one of these oil rigs in the South Atlantic, off the Brazilian coast, legal disputes with insurance companies and with Petrobras, Germán Efromovich began investing in aviation. This was by pure chance, because a customer, who could not pay cash in a business deal, gave him two of his aircraft. This was the beginning of an air taxi company. The Efromovich brothers called it OceanAir and started to transport staff between the oil exploration site in Macaé and Rio de Janeiro. OceanAir, 2010 renamed Avianca Brazil, was launched in 1998 and six years later he purchased the Colombian legacy airline Avianca from Julio Mario Santo Domingo. As a result of his major investments in Colombia's economic and social development, Efromovich was officially made an honorary Colombian citizen in 2005 by the Colombian government.
He has control or shares in his own Synergy Group, based in Rio de Janeiro, which in 1998 was offering maintenance services for oil operations in Brazil. In late 2004, Efromovich's company agreed to buy a controlling stake in Avianca, which at the time was under the protection of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Synergy Group subsequently acquired the remainder of Avianca in 2005.
In February 2010, Avianca and TACA merged to AviancaTaca. The TACA Group encompassed TACA Airlines and their participation in Lacsa, Aviateca, Sansa Airlines, La Costeña, Aeroperlas and Isleña Airlines. Avianca includes: Avianca, Tampa Cargo and the recently incorporated AeroGal from Ecuador. The combined Avianca and Taca is now the second-largest airline in the region in terms of revenue, behind Chilean-Brazilian's LATAM Airlines Group. All these airlines are controlled by Synergy Aerospace Corp. based in Bogota, a subsidiarity of Synergy Group.
Efromovich also has shares in Wayraperú, Avianca Ecuador and OceanAir, which was later renamed Avianca Brasil.
On November 5, 2017, the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment, revealed that Efromovich and Synergy Group's subsidiary Avianca Holdings were linked to an offshore conglomerate used for the aerocommercial holding business with ramifications in Bermuda, Panama and Cyprus. Efromovich used a Panamanian offshore that hid more than 20 firms located in tax havens.
On August 19, 2020, Efromovich and his brother José were arrested in São Paulo as a part of Operation Car Wash, and as a result of their involvement in a corruption scheme that involved paying bribes of about R$40 million between 2009 and 2013 to Petrobras and Transpetro high executives so as to win bids to build Panamax ships for the company in the Efremovichs' Estaleiro Ilha (Eisa) shipyard. Both arrests were preemptive, and the brothers were put under house arrest in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Efromovich has insisted on his innocence. A Brazilian tribunal considered that the accusations are proper, and decided to start a trial in September 2020.
The arrest order on both brothers was lifted on November 11, 2020, in response to a "habeas corpus" claim by their defense, although the injunction and preemptive measures are being held in place, which forbids them from leaving the country, changing their residence without informing the authorities, moving any banking account outside the country, or making any management or financial decision in the companies they are stockholders of. They also must surrender their passports, informing the judge of their current addresses and committing to attend all appointments and hearings to which they are summoned as part of the process being advanced on them.
Efromovich is the president of a 2022 Italian start-up airline, AeroItalia.
Family.
Germán Efromovich is married to Hilda and they have three daughters. His life is spent shuttling between São Paulo and Bogotá. He has a brother named José Efromovich, five years younger, who was the chairman of Avianca Brazil.

Brotherhood of Justice

The Brotherhood of Justice is a 1986 Canadian-American television action movie featuring Keanu Reeves, Billy Zane, Kiefer Sutherland, and Lori Loughlin.
Film critic &amp; historian Leonard Maltin disliked the picture, describing it as "..."Head of the Class" meets "The Mod Squad"."
Overview.
The movie is based on actual events that occurred at Paschal High School in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1984. The vigilante group called themselves "The Legion of Doom". The movie was filmed in Santa Cruz County in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Some locations used were Aptos High School in Aptos, California, Downtown Watsonville, California, the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, and various beaches in the area around Santa Cruz.
Plot.
The eponymous "Brotherhood of Justice" begins as an attempt by several students to end vandalism and drug sales in and near their high school, but this "solution" gradually becomes worse than the original problem. As the Brotherhood's targets expand to include all who irritate them for any reason, the group's actions escalate to arson and attempted murder. Its original main organizer, Derek, realizing what the group has become, eventually reports his comrades.

Age-of-consent reform in the United Kingdom

Restrictions on sexual activity involving minors in the United Kingdom and its predecessors have existed since medieval times. During the 1970s, there was some political advocacy in favour of significantly reducing the age of consent. Meanwhile, over a similar time period, the unequal age of consent for straight and gay young people was campaigned against by the LGBT rights movement. More recently arguments have occasionally been made in favour of reducing the age of consent, generally to an earlier point in adolescence.
Legal history.
In 1275, the first age of consent was set in England, at age 12 (Statute of Westminster I). In 1875, the Offences Against the Person Act raised the age to 13 in Great Britain and Ireland, and ten years later the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 raised it to 16. In 1917, a bill raising the age of consent in Great Britain and Ireland from 16 to 17 was defeated by only one vote.
In 1950, the Parliament of Northern Ireland passed the Children and Young Persons Act, which successfully raised the age of consent to 17. However, in 2008 this enactment was reversed by the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008, which made the age of consent in Northern Ireland 16, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. The reason given for this change being made was to bring the age of consent into line with the rest of the United Kingdom. The Criminal Justice Minister, Paul Goggins, said there was no compelling reason for the age to be different in Northern Ireland.
The male homosexual age of consent in the England and Wales was set at 21 in the Sexual Offences Act 1967 for "consenting adults in private" (following the recommendations of the Wolfenden Report). In 1980 The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act (1980) legalised homosexual acts at age 21. The homosexual age of consent was then lowered to 18 in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, and finally lowered to 16 (equalising it with the heterosexual age of consent) in England &amp; Wales and Scotland in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000.
Currently, the age of consent for penetrative sex, oral sex and mutual masturbation in the United Kingdom is 16 years. Relevant legislation is devolved, meaning that it is up to each UK nation to set their age of consent. However, each nation has set the relevant legal age at 16 (under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 in England and Wales, the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 (in Scotland) and the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (in Northern Ireland).
This means that in each UK nation, if an individual is to have sex with someone 15 or less, they may be charged with a criminal offence.
Similarly, the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 prohibits someone in a position of trust from performing sexual acts with someone who cannot consent, which includes minors, and "very vulnerable people".
Advocacy.
Reduction.
1970s.
The decriminalisation of sex between men over the age of 21 convinced some paedophiles that they might soon be able to change the law and social attitudes to allow for their desire to have sex with children. The Paedophile Information Exchange was an organisation with around 300 members which used its links inside government and the civil liberties movement to lobby for the decriminalisation of sex with children as young as four years old. Arguments around relaxing age-of-consent laws relating to adolescents in particular did also have a wider reach. Sociologist Matthew Waites, author of "The age of Consent – Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship", observed that:By the mid-1970s the case for a lower minimum age for all was finding wider support, with questions being posed concerning the merits of lowering the legal age for male/female sexual behaviour – not only within grassroots sexual movements, but also within religious organisations and liberal intellectual circles. [...] Significant sections of liberal opinion in the political mainstream, including prominent campaigners for children’s interests and sexual health, support at least some selective decriminalisation of sexual activity between young people under 18.In August 1971 young members of the Gay Liberation Front organised a public rally in London to protest at the age of consent for gay men.
In April 1972, the Society of Friends Social Responsibility Council (a Quaker conference), passed a resolution in favour of lowering the age of consent in Britain from 16 to 14. In July of that year, Dr. John Robinson, Dean of Trinity College, Cambridge, and chair of the UK's Sexual Law Reform Society, defended an age of consent of 14 in a lecture at a Methodist Conference.
In May 1974, the Campaign for Homosexual Equality suggested a basic age of consent of 16, but that could be as low as 12 "in cases where a defendant could prove the existence of meaningful consent". The "Sexual Law Reform Society" proposed in September of that year lowering the age of consent to 14, with the requirement that below the age of 18 the burden of proof that consent for sexual activities between the parties existed would be the responsibility of the older participant.
In March 1976, the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL), called for an equal age of consent of 14, or 10, in Britain. The submission to the Criminal Law Revision Committee generated extensive newspaper coverage. While the report recognised the merits of abolishing the age of consent, it proposed retaining a prohibition on sex under the age of 14 "as a compromise with public attitudes", stating that "although it is both logical and consistent with modern knowledge about child development, to suggest that the age of consent should be abolished, we fear that, given the present state of public attitudes on this topic, it will not be politically possible to abolish the age of consent". They also argued that "childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in, with an adult result in no identifiable damage" and suggested that more harm was caused when the children retold their experiences in court or to the press. The submission was signed by Harriet Harman, who was a legal officer for the NCCL at the time before becoming an MP in 1982. Harman denies ever supporting the age of consent being lowered to 10, and claimed that right-wing newspapers the Daily Mail and The Telegraph had tried to make her "guilty by association" with fringe groups that had previously been connected to the NCCL.
More recent arguments.
By the end of the 20th century, those in favour of reducing the age of consent faster were pointing to faster physical development and increasing levels of sexual activity among adolescents as reasoning. More generally in academic work, particularly in sociology, writing on human sexual behaviour debated prohibitions on sexual activity involving children.
Although he does not favour total abolition, Francis Bennion, a British liberal humanist also influenced by the historical context of the issue, emphasised the fact that children are "sexual beings", concluding that this in itself makes legal prohibitions unfair.
Miranda Sawyer, British journalist specialised in music and youth culture, suggested that "we have sexual feelings from a very early age", considering that sex is "natural behaviour". She favoured lowering the age of consent to 12 in the UK while labeling the criminalisation of sexual activity under the age of 16 as "laughably unrealistic".
In November 2013, a leading public health expert and Faculty of Public Health president, Professor John Ashton, called for the age of consent to be lowered to 15. He said that the current legal limit prevented sexually active younger teenagers from getting support with issues of disease and contraception. He said that official figures indicated as many as a third of all 14- and 15-year-olds are having sex in Britain and said that a nationwide debate was needed to discuss the benefits of lowering the present age of consent of 16. The call was rejected by then Prime Minister David Cameron and then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg that same year.
Criticism.
Evidence from some of the groups who have advocated for lowering the age of consent have included known and convicted paedophiles within some of the organisations, for example the Paedophile Information Exchange.
Research.
Research by Jean Golding showed that by the early 2000s puberty was occurring earlier than in the 1970s, with an average age of menarche in girls now at 12 years and 10 months, compared to the average age of 14 for puberty in general that was accepted as evidence by the Policy Advisory Committee of the 1970s. Golding's research has found that "one girl in six hits puberty at the age of eight".
According to British research conducted by the Centre for Family and Household Research in the 1990s, "an increasing proportion of young people are sexually active below the age of consent". Additionally, the UK's first National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL), which collected data up to 1990, found that a high proportion of young people engage in other forms of sexual activity prohibited by the law, including mutual masturbation and oral sex, beginning on average at the age of 14.
Waites also observed that "qualitative research reveals a picture of many young people negotiating sexual behaviour in a context of secrecy, constrained by power relationships while lacking confidence, resources and support". He added, "It is argued by some sexual health professionals that the age of consent should be lowered [...] to facilitate more effective support from health and education services".
Public opinion.
In November 2000, an internet poll of 42,000 girls aged 12 to 16 was conducted. "Nine out of 10 respondents did not believe in waiting until marriage to have sex, while 87 per cent said the age of consent should be lowered from 16. Sex education was criticised as out-dated, uninformative and taught too late, with little structured literature about sexually transmitted diseases, same-sex relationships and how to deal with pregnancy". Those surveyed also said that free condoms should be provided in girls' toilets and that the £60 million drive by the government to halve teenage conceptions would have been better spent on clinics for young people wanting confidential advice.

Talal Asad

Talal Asad (born 1932) is a Saudi-born British-Pakistani cultural anthropologist who is currently Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Anthropology and Middle Eastern Studies at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. His prolific body of work mainly focuses on religiosity, Middle Eastern studies, postcolonialism, and notions of power, law, and discipline. He is also known for his writing calling for an anthropology of secularism. 
His work has had a significant influence beyond his home discipline of anthropology. As Donovan Schaefer writes:The gravitational field of Asad’s influence has emanated far from his home discipline and reshaped the landscape of other humanistic disciplines around him.
Biography.
Talal Asad was born in April 1932 in Medina, Saudi Arabia. His parents are Muhammad Asad, an Austrian diplomat and writer who converted from Judaism to Islam in his twenties, and Munira Hussein Al Shammari, a Saudi Arabian Muslim. Asad was born in Saudi Arabia but when he was eight months old his family moved to British India, where his father was part of the Pakistan Movement. His parents divorced shortly before his father's third marriage. Talal was raised in Pakistan, and attended a Christian-run missionary boarding school. He is an alumnus of the St. Anthony High School in Lahore. Asad moved to the United Kingdom when he was 18 to attend university and studied architecture for two years before discovering anthropology, about which he has said “it was fun, but I was not terribly suited.”
Asad received his undergraduate degree in anthropology from the University of Edinburgh in 1959. He continued to train as a cultural anthropologist, receiving both a Bachelor of Letters and PhD from the University of Oxford, which he completed in 1968. Asad’s mentor while at Oxford was notable social anthropologist E.E. Evans-Pritchard, who Asad has since cited in many of his works. While attending the University of Edinburgh, he met Tanya Baker, a fellow anthropologist. The two married in 1960, and later both completed their doctorate research at Oxford.
After his doctoral studies, Asad completed fieldwork in Northern Sudan on the political structures of the Kababish, a nomadic group that formed under British colonial rule. He published "The Kababish Arabs: Power, Authority, and Consent in a Nomadic Tribe" in 1970. Asad became increasingly interested in religiosity, power, and Orientalism throughout his studies. In the late 1960s, he formed a reading group that focused on material written in the Middle East. He recalls being struck by the bias and “theoretical poverty” of Orientalist writing, the assumptions taken for granted, and the questions that were not answered.
Throughout his long and prolific career, Asad has been greatly influenced by a broad spectrum of scholars, including notable figures such as Karl Marx, E.E. Evans-Pritchard, R.G. Collingwood, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Michel Foucault. He has also cited the invaluable influence of contemporaries and colleagues such as John Milbank, Stanley Hauerwas, Edward Said, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Judith Butler, as well as his former students Saba Mahmood and Charles Hirschkind. This diverse intellectual network has shaped Asad's unique approach to studying society, culture, and power dynamics, leaving a lasting impact on the field of social sciences.
Career.
Asad’s first teaching job was at Khartoum University in Sudan, where he spent several years as a lecturer in social anthropology. He returned to the United Kingdom in the early 1970s to lecture at Hull University in Hull, England. He moved to the United States in 1989, and taught at the New School for Social Research in New York City and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, before acquiring his current position of Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Asad has also held visiting professorships at Ain Shams University in Cairo, King Saud University in Riyadh, University of California at Berkeley, and the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris.
Asad’s writing portfolio is extensive, and he has been involved in a variety of projects throughout his career. His books include "Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter", published in 1973, "Genealogies of Religion", published in 1993, "Formations of the Secular", published in 2003, and "On Suicide Bombing", published in 2007 and written in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 1983, he was a co-editor on "The Sociology of Developing Societies: The Middle East" with economic historian Roger Owen. Asad has said that he wasn’t all that interested in this project and that he did it as a favor to a friend. In 2007 Asad was part of a symposium at the Townsend Center at University of California, Berkeley, at which he spoke on his paper "Is Critique Secular? Blasphemy, Injury, and Free Speech".
Since 2023, Ibn Haldun University has granted the annual Talal Asad Award for the best graduate dissertation in sociology.
He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2024.
Contributions.
Asad’s work generally involves taking an anthropological approach to political history and analysis, specifically with regard to colonial history and religion. Asad identifies himself as an anthropologist but also states that he is critical of allowing disciplines to be defined by particular techniques (such as ethnography or statistics, for example).
He is often critical of progress narratives, believing that “the assumption of social development following a linear path should be problematized.” Another main facet of his work is his public criticism of Orientalism. He has expressed frustration with Orientalist assumptions, particularly about religion, which he has said comes from his multicultural Muslim background. His father considered Islam to be primarily an intellectual idea, while his mother considered it an “embodied, unreflective way of living.” Asad’s own interest in religion was based in an attempt to engage with theoretical explorations and to make sense of political and personal experiences. He is particularly interested in conceptions of religion as an embodied practice and the role that discipline plays in this practice.
In an essay published in 1986, "The Idea of an Anthropology of Islam", Talal Asad introduces a concept which has since marked a turning point in the study of Islam – discursive tradition.
Observing the multiplication of anthropological works on ‘Islam’ and ‘Muslims’ in Western anthropology at his time, Asad points at the simultaneous general incapacity to comprehend any of them. Most analyses, Asad notices, conclude on either the theoretical inexistence of Islam ; the irreducible multiplicity of its forms ; or define it as a total socio-historical structure. While each of these propositions holds some relevance, they remain unsatisfying – if not wrong due to an initial conceptual flaw, which he proposes to discuss, for ‘to conceptualize Islam as the object of an anthropological study is not as simple a matter as some writers would have one suppose.’ The very question to answer indeed, the starting point of any attempt at understanding Islam, is that of its correct defining – a seemingly basic point which nonetheless reveals paradigm-shifting when put into practice.
Asad’s intervention on Islam is nothing less than a critique of established anthropology as an ethnocentric, irreflexive and in that still much colonial discipline, in which paradigms and methods are to be challenged and revised in order for it to properly engage with human forms existing outside of its cultural cradle. He there specifically challenges two of the main anthropologists of religion, Clifford Geertz and Ernest Gellner, who, to him, impose on Islam a Western modern idea of religion, itself the product of a history of progressive separation of the latter from ‘the spheres of real power and reason such as politics, law, and science’. Asad argues for the importance of the historicization of both observer’s positions and analytical categories and their insertion within a certain power-knowledge moment and configuration, a theoretical approach he draws from Foucault. When it comes to understanding Islam, this implies the adoption of an internal perspective, ‘as Muslims do’, that is, ‘from the concept of a discursive tradition that includes and relates itself to the founding texts of the Qur'an and the Hadith.’
Asad defines tradition as a set of prescriptive discourses, taught and transmitted, that draw their legitimacy, power and meaning from history. They thereby found social cohesion through shared practices articulating the past, present and future of the group i.e Muslims. Asad’s discursive tradition, while pursuing the decentering project engaged by decolonial thinkers such as Edward Said, attempts at complexifying the dichotomy that had been constituted by scholars of Islam between Great and little traditions. While the first one was considered as followed by the elite, text-based and urban – and thus orthodox, the latter characterized the diversity of local practices of rural communities and, in opposition, was understood as heterodox. Yet, for Asad, there is no such thing as a clear distinction between texts and practices of Islam. On the contrary, texts, which do not have an agency by themselves, are practiced, that is read, discussed, made sense of and embodied by believers – and, this, within a given social structure, that is power-knowledge configuration. The relationship between Muslims and the texts is what makes Islam, Asad argues, making of orthodoxy ‘not just a body of opinion but a relationship of power’. This allows him to introduce a political economy perspective in the analysis of Islam, which, dismissed by Geertz and Gellner’s focus on dramatization, explains the diversity of its forms in different contexts.
Asad’s discursive tradition concept has been fundamental for a number of later Islam scholars, although diversely interpreted and prolonged, as noted by Ovamir Anjum. He, for instance, considers that Lukens-Bull misunderstands Asad when he talks of an orthodox Islam as based on the Qu’ran and Hadiths. He nonetheless considers that such a confusion reveals the limits of Asad’s proposition, which does not explain the articulation between local and global orthodoxies. Anjum thus argues for an enriching of the discursive tradition approach with world-system analyses applied to Islam.
Following the 2013 coup d’état in Egypt, Asad wrote an essay, "Thinking About Tradition, Religion, and Politics in Egypt Today", in which he engages with Hannah Arendt’s notions of revolution and tradition. Asad argues that the founding of a political tradition is marked by the necessity of violence, and both revolutions and coups use the narrative of necessary violence towards saving and securing the posterity of the nation. The difference, Arendt and Asad both agree on, is that a revolution involves a vision of beginning anew by founding a new tradition, a new system, whereas a coup is meant to replace individuals in power, therefore conserving a living tradition. This is just one of many notable essays Asad has written that deal with concepts of power, discipline, and law.
William E. Connolly attempts to summarize Asad's theoretical contributions on secularism as follows:
Notable works.
"Genealogies of Religion".
"Genealogies of Religion" was published in 1993. The intention of this book is to critically examine the cultural hegemony of the West, exploring how Western concepts and religious practices have shaped the way history is written. The book deals with a variety of historical topics ranging from medieval European rites to the sermons of contemporary Arab theologians. What links them all together, according to Asad, is the assumption that Western history has the greatest importance in the modern world and that explorations of Western history should be the main concern of historians and anthropologists.
The book begins by sketching the emergence of religion as a modern historical object in the first two chapters. Following this, Asad discusses two elements of medieval Christianity that are no longer generally accepted by modern religion, those being the productive role of physical pain and the virtue of self-abasement. While he is not arguing for these practices, he is encouraging readers to think critically about how and why modernism and secular morality position these as archaic “uncivilized” conditions. Asad then addresses aspects of “asymmetry” between western and non-western histories, the largest of these being the fact that Western history is considered the “norm” in that non-Westerners feel the need to study Western history, but this does not go both ways. These “asymmetrical desires and indifferences”, Asad argues, have historically constructed opposition between West and non-West. The final two chapters of the books were written at the height of the Rushdie affair in the late 1980s and address angry responses to religious intolerance in the name of liberalism.
"Formations of the Secular".
Asad published "Formations of the Secular" in 2003. The central idea of the book is creating anthropology of the secular and what that would entail. This is done through first defining and deconstructing secularism and some of its various parts. Asad’s definition posits “secular” as an epistemic category, whereas “secularism” refers to a political doctrine. The intention of this definition is to urge the reader to understand secular and secularism as more than the absence of religiosity, but rather a mode of society that has its own forms of cultural mediation. Secularism, as theorized by Asad, is also deeply rooted in narratives of modernity and progress that formed out of the European Enlightenment, meaning that it is not as “tolerant” and “neutral” as it is widely considered to be. On this, Asad writes “A secular state does not guarantee toleration; it puts into play different structures of ambition and fear. The law never seeks to eliminate violence since its object is always to regulate violence.”
After giving a short genealogy of the concept of “the secular”, Asad discusses agency, pain, and cruelty, how they relate to embodiment, and how they are conceptualized in secular society. From here, he goes into an exploration of different ways in which “the human” or the individual is conceptualized and how this informs different understandings of human rights - establishing “human rights” as having a subjective definition rather than being an objective set of rules. Later chapters explore notions and assumptions around “religious minorities” in Europe, and a discussion of whether nationalism is essentially secular or religious in nature. The final few chapters explore transformations in religious authority, law, and ethics in colonial Egypt in order to illuminate aspects of secularization not usually attended to.
The concluding thought of "Formations of the Secular" is the question of what anthropology can contribute to the clarification of questions about secularism. Asad does not determine a clear answer to this question, but encourages exploring secularism “through its shadows” and advises that anthropology of secularism should start asking how “different sensibilities, attitudes, assumptions, and behaviors come together to either support or undermine the doctrine of secularism?”
"On Suicide Bombing".
In response to the September 11 attacks and the rise in anti-Islamic sentiment that followed, Asad published "On Suicide Bombing" in 2007. This book is intended to confront questions about political violence that are central to our modern society and to deconstruct western notions of Islamic terrorism. The central question of the book is not to ask why someone would become a suicide bomber, but instead to think critically about why suicide bombing generates such horror.
Asad offers several suggestions or potential explanations as to why there is a particular sense of horror when confronted with suicide bombing:
Asad’s hope in writing this book is not to defend suicide bombing, but instead to go beyond some of the commonly held positions surrounding it. In particular, he is critical of the denunciation of religious violence as the very opposite of legitimate, "justified" political violence that the U.S. engages in. His goal is to communicate that if there is no such thing as "justified terrorism", there is no such thing as "justified war" and therefore to turn the readers' attention to a critical examination of killing, of dying, and of letting live and letting die in modern global politics.

Chamundeshwari Temple

The Chamundeshwari Temple is a Hindu temple located on the top of Chamundi Hills about 13 km from the palace city of Mysuru in the state of Karnataka in India. The temple was named after Chamundeshwari or, the fierce form of Shakti, a tutelary deity held in reverence for centuries by the Maharaja of Mysuru.
Chamundeshwari is called by the people of Karnataka as Nada Devi (ನಾಡ ದೇವಿ), which means state Goddess. It is situated at the elevation of around 3300 ft from the mean sea level. It is believed that Goddess Durga slayed the demon king Mahishasura on the top of this hill which was ruled by him. The place was later known as Mahishooru (Place of Mahisha). The British changed it to Mysore and later Kannadized into Mysuru.
Religious importance.
The Chamundeshwari Temple is considered as a Shakta pitha and one among the 18 Shakta pithas. It is known as "Krouncha Pitha" as the region was known in Puranic times as Krouncha Puri.
It is said that the hair of Sati fell here.
Architecture.
The original shrine is thought to have been built in the 12th century by the rulers of the Hoysala Dynasty while its tower was probably built by the Rulers of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 17th century. In 1659, a staircase of one thousand steps was built leading up to the 3000-foot summit of the hill. The sanctum houses the image of Chamundeswari sported with 'Ashtabhuja' or eight hands. 
At the temple are several images of Nandi (the bull mount of Shiva). There is a huge granite Nandi on the 700th step on the hill in front of a small Shiva temple a short distance away. The image was installed by Mysore Maharaja Dooda Devaraja Wodeyar during 1664. The Chamundi hills also houses Sri Mahabaleswara temple and also Sri Narayanaswamy temple.
Festivals.
The temple is famous for the celebrations of festivals like Ashada Shukravara (ಆಶಾಡಾ ಶುಕ್ರವಾರ), Navaratri and Ammanavara Vardhanthi (ಅಮ್ಮನವರ ವರ್ಧಂತಿ). In the month of Ashadha, Fridays are considered particularly auspicious. Lakhs of devotees throng the temple during this occasion. Another festival celebrated during this month is Chamundi Jayanti. This day is celebrated on the anniversary of the consecration of the Utsava Moorti of the goddess by the Maharaja of Mysore. On this occasion, the goddess's idol is taken around the temple in a golden palanquin.
The most important festival that is celebrated here is Navaratri. Mysuru Dasara is celebrated as the state festival of Karnataka, called Nada habba (ನಾಡಾ ಹಬ್ಬಾ) in Kannada. During Navaratri, the idol is decorated in 9 different ways to depict the nine different aspects of the goddess known as Navadurgas. On the 7th day of Navaratri that is dedicated to the goddess Kalaratri, valuable jewels donated by Maharajas are brought from the District Treasury of Mysuru and are given to the temple to decorate the idol.
Another temple is situated at the foothill which is in Utthanahalli called as Jwalamalini Sri Tripura Sundari Temple. This goddess is considered the sister of Chamundeshwari who helped her at the battlefield to slay the demon Raktabīja.

Five Score and Seven Years Ago

Five Score and Seven Years Ago is the fifth studio album by Christian rock band Relient K. It was released on March 6, 2007, and is the band's final album on both Capitol Records and Gotee Records. It is the first full-length album by the band to feature bassist John Warne (replacing founding member Brian Pittman) and guitarist Jon Schneck. Furthermore, it would serve as drummer Dave Douglas' last album with the band until "Air for Free" (2016). Future drummer Ethan Luck makes his debut on the track "Deathbed".
Background and recording.
For "Five Score and Seven Years Ago", the album was not only produced by Mark Lee Townsend and Matt Thiessen, but also by Howard Benson. Explaining the decision to work with another producer, Thiessen said, "I wanted somebody to say... I'm like, 'I want to put that part in the song' and he's like, 'That part doesn't make sense, it's not going in the song.' Y'know? I wanted somebody to tell me what to do. That's kind of what he's known for I guess. He's very blunt about his opinion and whatnot, and it worked really well." Guitarist Matt Hoopes stated he was "pretty nervous" about working with another producer, said in the end "was a good experience." It is the first album the band recorded with members John Warne and Jon Schneck.
Most of the album was recorded in Los Angeles with Benson, at Bay 7 Studio and Sparky Dark Studio. The rest of the album would be recorded at S-S Studio in Spring Hill, Tennessee. The album was mixed by Chris Lord-Alge at Resonate Music Studio in Burbank, California, and by J.R. McNeely at Sound Kitchen in Franklin, Tennessee. It was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in New York City.
It was recorded from June to August 2006. The album had a scheduled release date for the fall of 2006, ultimately leading to the group rushing the recording process. However, the label decided to delay it for "some reasons," according to Hoopes. Blending together power pop and pop punk, influences of the Beach Boys, Blink-182 and Fountains of Wayne can be heard.
Composition.
Speaking about writing the album, Thiessen stated, "I really love to not be serious all the time, even when I am being serious. It's the same flavor but we try to stretch it a little bit. It's still melodic, it's still rock 'n' roll, there are still a lot of dynamics. But at the same time, we're trying to write a bit differently, lyrically." Tracks such as "Devastation and Reform", "Bite My Tongue" and "Up and Up", offer a side of redemption, while songs like "Must Have Done Something Right" is described as a feel good song and "The Best Thing" as a "positive" track. "Pleading the Fifth" was the last song Thiessen wrote for the album as "something 'dumb'" he needed to fit the album title. He explained his vision behind the track stating, "I always wanted to do a song where I did the drums with my voice. And then I didn't want to just put them on the track, I wanted to get a kit and trigger all the drum sounds while you're playing it. So it's like you're actually playing my voice as a drum kit. So that was the goal of a song, cause I wanted it to be an a cappella song and my voice as the drums."
The earliest written track for the album is "Faking My Own Suicide", which Thiessen wrote in 2001. He never put the song on a record as he felt it was a bit controversial. He said, "I thought Christian audiences would never be able to accept it [...] I know Matt's (Hoopes) mom was like 'Even saying the word 'suicide' in a song, people have experiences with that, like a loved one or whatever, it's going to conjure up some ill feelings,' but the song isn't meaning to go in that direction. Obviously, it seems dark, but it's not." The last track "Deathbed", features Jon Foreman of Switchfoot and was originally written about Thiessen picturing himself of what it would be like lying on his deathbed. However, he thought the idea was bad and re-wrote it and created a fictitious character going through the stages of life.
Title and cover art.
According to lead singer, Matt Thiessen, the album was created with a "Five" theme, as it is the band's fifth album, and for the first time Relient K has five members on an album. The "Seven Years Ago" links with the fact that the group's first album was created seven years prior to the release of this album, making for five albums in seven years. It also ties in with the famous line, "Four score and seven years ago", delivered by Abraham Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln is addressed in the first track, "Plead the Fifth". 
Release.
"Must Have Done Something Right" was released to iTunes on November 28, 2006, as the lead single from the album, along with a non-album bonus song titled "Fallen Man," also sometimes referred to as "(Hope for Every) Fallen Man." The album's second single, "Forgiven," was released for the Christian radio market on December 1. The music video for "Must Have Done Something Right" was posted online on February 10, 2007. "Five Score and Seven Years Ago" was released on March 6, 2007, through Capitol. From early March to late May, the band went on a tour of the U.S. with support from Mae and Sherwood. During this trek, they appeared at The Bamboozle festival. On April 10, 2007, "The Best Thing" was released as the album's third single. On June 6, the music video for the song was posted online. In July, the band release two singles to Christian radio, "I Need You" and "Give Until There's Nothing Left". The sixth and final single "Devastation and Reform" was serviced to Christian radio in January 2008.
A special edition of "Five Score and Seven Years Ago" was also released, including a bonus DVD with roughly thirty minutes of acoustic performances shot in the Capitol A Studios and including track-to-track interviews with the band. Also included is a making-of feature on the "Must Have Done Something Right" music video as well as the video itself, which was directed by Marc Webb. The album's cover also came with a special slip-cover that outlined the band members in orange drawings. From mid-October to early December, the group went on a co-headlining US tour with Switchfoot, dubbed The Appetite for Construction Tour. Between June and August 2008, the band performed on the 2008 edition of Warped Tour. In October and November, the band went on tour with This Providence, Ludo and House of Heroes. In November and December, the band went on the Winter Wonder-Slam Tour in the US with TobyMac. During the tour, the band performed Christmas songs alongside their regular songs.
Reception.
The album was met with positive reviews from music critics. Tony Pascarella of AbsolutePunk.net stated, "It expands on the happier (yet musically grittier) side of "Mmhmm" without losing any of the band's trademark fun [...] Relient K consistently outdo themselves, and "Five Score and Seven Years Ago" sets the bar higher yet." Jared Johnson of AllMusic said the group "showed that a punk-pop record could truly be innovative and memorable with "Five Score"." Alternative Addiction rewarded the album a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and praised the producing efforts of Howard Benson stating, "the work on "Five Score and Seven Years Ago" is some of the best production, some of the most polished work, maybe ever. The production value of this alone makes this album a must listen." "Chart Attack" wrote a mixed review for the album, ""Five Score and Seven Years Ago" finds the group writing with a broader scope, using complex harmonies and grandiose piano arrangements to flesh out their songs. The problem is, they always fall back on formulaic structures and singer Matt Thiessen's breathy, one-dimensional delivery. Symptomatic of these issues is 'I'm Taking You With Me'. Its 'whoa-oh' choruses and predictable melodies have already been done to death by this band and countless others." 
Russ Breimeier of "Christianity Today" remarked, "Their new album isn't really a departure, remaining true to the power pop and punk rock that they do so well. Most of their hallmarks are here, due largely to Thiessen's gift for irresistible melodies and clever lyrics. But the band sounds even tighter with a new bassist and guitarist since 2004's "Mmhmm", and now all the members contribute to the vocal harmonies." He also said the group benefited from the production work of Benson. Tony Cummings of "Cross Rhythms" gave a similar review writing, "bringing in a second guitarist has enabled the lads from Canton, Ohio to experiment with a broader musical palate with piano in particular adding a new dimension to those crunching guitar rhythms. It is also due in part to the production with both mainstream maestro Howard Benson and Mark Townsend. Both rise to the challenge in taking the band's sound beyond pogoing popdom with an expansion of musical textures." Josh Taylor of Jesus Freak Hideout said, "Still, the fact remains, Thiessen keeps maturing as a wordsmith. You would think eventually the guy would lose some steam, but it is simply not the case. "Five Score and Seven Years Ago" goes down as another landmark record for the Canton, Ohio boys, and is easily one of the best of 2007, thus far." Tom Whitson of "The Music Zine" gave the album a 4 out of 5 star rating, describing the record as "a pretty great album with some laughs along the way if you listen out amongst the more serious and dark aspects." 
A mixed review came from Chad Grischow of IGN, who felt the album was "generic," highlighting "I Need You", "Devastation and Reform" and "Faking My Own Suicide" as examples. He also criticized the "bland songwriting" on the tracks, "I'm Taking You With Me" and "Must Have Done Something Right". However, he praised "Deathbed" as the album's "most engaging song" that "holds your interest from beginning to end." Overall, he said the album "is too generic for Relient K's, or the listeners', own good. Despite their efforts to toughen up much of it music with a harder edge, the album fails to separate itself from the hundreds of other similar albums released over the past few years." Shawn Conner of "The Georgia Straight" also wrote the album a mixed review, stating it "works at least half the time, usually when the band avoids emo clichés like angst-ridden lead and shouty background vocals that erupt into pimply choruses." Michael Cooney of "The Music Box" wrote a negative review for the album, calling it "a colossal disappointment" and said that the band "apparently has elected to abandon both its previous lyrical charm and its musical sensitivity in favor of constructing an album that sadly sounds just like everything else on the radio." 
BuzzFeed included the album at No. 36 on the website's "36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F——ing Die" list. Indie Vision Music listed it as "The Best of 2007: Favorite Hits From 10 Years Ago."
Commercial performance.
"Five Score and Seven Years Ago" debuted at number six on the "Billboard" 200, selling 64,000 copies in its first week. The album also topped the US Christian Albums chart for three weeks. As of July 11, 2007, it has sold 152,560 copies in the US and over 750,000 copies worldwide.

Darby Field

Darby Field (1610–1649) was the first European to climb Mount Washington in New Hampshire.
Biography.
Of English ancestry, Field was born in Boston, Lincolnshire, England. His father was John Field of London. By 1636, he immigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, and settled in Durham, New Hampshire, by 1638, where he ran a ferry from what is now called Durham Point to the town of Newington, across Little Bay. He was known as an Indian translator.
Field's ascent of Mount Washington, in 1642, when he was about 32 years of age, was recorded by Governor John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in his journal:
Darby Field was remarkably accurate in the estimated distances, though the distant bodies of water were likely cloud-banks, and his description of the top of Mount Washington was likewise accurate. Field's feat was repeated only a handful of times over the next 150 years.
The account of a party of hikers in 1816 shows that they followed Darby Field's notes as a guide and simply saw him as overenthusiastic at the summit; "The relation of Darby field, may be considered as in the main correct, after making reasonable deductions for the distance, the length of the Muscovy glass, and the quantity of water in view, which it may be suspected has not been seen by any visitor since his time." At that time, mica (Muscovy glass) was used in the manufacturing of stoves and was quite an expensive commodity.
Darby Field and his wife Agnes had five children before his death in 1649 at Dover, New Hampshire.
Mount Field in the Willey Range of the White Mountains is named in his honor. Field is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 11) along New Hampshire Route 16 in Pinkham's Grant.

Heated bath

A heated bath is used in the laboratory to allow a chemical reaction to occur at an elevated temperature.
In contrast to traditional Bunsen burners, heated baths use liquids to transfer heat to the reaction vessel. This is achieved using a high-boiling point liquid inside a thermally conducting bath (usually made of metal). Water and silicone oil are the most commonly used fluids. A water bath is used for temperatures up to 100 °C. An oil bath is employed for temperatures above 100 °C.
The heated bath is heated on an electric hot plate, or with a Bunsen burner. The reaction vessel (Florence flask, Erlenmeyer flask, or beaker) is immersed in the heated bath. A thermometer is usually kept in the fluid to monitor the temperature.

Francis Browne

Francis Patrick Mary Browne, (3 January 1880 – 7 July 1960) was a distinguished Irish Jesuit and a prolific photographer. His best-known photographs are those of the and its passengers and crew taken before its sinking in 1912. He was decorated as a military chaplain during the First World War.
Early life.
Francis Browne was born to a wealthy family in 1880 at Buxton House, Cork, Ireland, the youngest of the eight children of James and Brigid (née Hegarty) Browne. His mother was the niece of William Hegarty, Lord Mayor of Cork, and a cousin of Sir Daniel Hegarty, the first Lord Mayor of Cork. She died of puerperal fever eight days after Francis's birth. After the death of his father in a swimming accident at Crosshaven on 2 September 1889, Browne was raised and supported by his uncle, Robert Browne, Bishop of Cloyne, who bought him his first camera shortly before the younger man embarked on a tour of Europe in 1897. 
Education.
He spent his formative years at Bower Convent, Athlone (1888–91), Belvedere College (1891–92), Christian Brothers College, Cork (1892–1893), St. Vincent's Castleknock College (1893–97), graduating in 1897. He went on the aforementioned tour of Europe, where he began taking photographs.
Upon his return to Ireland, he joined the Jesuits and spent two years in the novitiate at St Stanislaus College, Tullabeg, County Offaly. He attended the Royal University, Dublin, where he was a classmate of James Joyce, who featured him as "Mr Browne the Jesuit" in "Finnegans Wake". In 1909, he visited Rome with his uncle and brother (a bishop and priest respectively), during which they had a private audience with Pope Pius X: the Pope allowed Browne to take his photograph. He studied theology at the Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy in Dublin from 1911 to 1916.
Aboard the "Titanic".
In April 1912 he received a present from his uncle: a ticket for the maiden voyage of from Southampton, England, to Queenstown, Ireland, via Cherbourg, France. He travelled to Southampton via Liverpool and London, boarding the "Titanic" on the afternoon of 10 April 1912. He was booked in cabin no. A-37 on the Promenade Deck. Browne took dozens of photographs of life aboard "Titanic" on that day and the next morning; he shot pictures of the gymnasium, the Marconi room, the first-class dining saloon, his own cabin, and of passengers enjoying walks on the Promenade and Boat decks. He captured the last known images of many crew and passengers, including captain Edward J. Smith, gymnasium manager T. W. McCawley, engineer William Parr, Major Archibald Butt, writer Jacques Futrelle and numerous third-class passengers whose names are unknown.
During his voyage on the "Titanic", Browne was befriended by an American millionaire couple who were seated at his table in the liner's first-class dining saloon. They offered to pay his way to New York and back in return for Browne spending the voyage to New York in their company. Browne telegraphed his superior, requesting permission, but the reply was an unambiguous "GET OFF THAT SHIP – PROVINCIAL".
Browne disembarked the "Titanic" when she docked in Queenstown on April 11th and returned to Dublin to continue his theological studies. When the news of the ship's sinking reached him, he realised that his photos would be of great interest, and he negotiated their sale to various newspapers and news cartels. They appeared in publications around the world. The Eastman Kodak company subsequently gave him free film for life and Browne often contributed to "The Kodak Magazine". It’s unknown what type of camera Browne used to shoot the famous photos aboard "Titanic", nor is it clear where the negatives are of the photographs Browne took on the ship.
Later life.
First World War.
After his ordination on 31 July 1915, he completed his theological studies. In 1916, the 36-year-old Browne was sent to Europe to join the Irish Guards as a chaplain. He served with the Guards until the spring of 1920, including service at the Battle of the Somme and at Locre, Wytschaete, Messines Ridge, Passchendaele, Ypres, Amiens and Arras in Flanders.
Browne was wounded five times during the war, once severely in a gas attack. He was awarded the Military Cross (MC) on 4 June 1917 "for distinguished service in the field". He was awarded a bar to his MC (a second award) on 18 February 1918: his citation read "For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He was untiring in his efforts to succour the wounded during an attack. His courage and determination under heavy shell-fire were a magnificent example to all." He was also awarded the "Croix de Guerre" by France.
Browne took many photographs during his time in Europe; one, which he called "Watch on the Rhine", is considered a classic image of World War I. He assembled a collection of his war photographs in an album named after his most famous photograph and distributed copies to his colleagues in the Guards.
Post-War.
After the war, he returned to Dublin, where, in 1922, he was appointed superior of Gardiner Street Church in Dublin. Ill health dogged him, however, and in 1924 it was thought that he would recover more quickly in warmer climes. He was sent on an extended visit to Australia. He took his camera along, photographing life aboard ship and in Cape Town, South Africa, where he broke his voyage. His photographs from Australia covered a cross-section of life in the continent; he took pictures of farms, cattle stations, industries, new immigrants, and members of Irish religious orders who lived in that country.
On his way back to Ireland, he visited Ceylon, Aden, Suez, Saloniki, Naples, Toulon, Gibraltar, Algeciras, and Lisbon, taking photographs of local life and events at every stop. It is estimated that Browne took more than 42,000 photographs during his life.
Browne resumed office as the Superior of Saint Francis Xavier Church, Dublin, upon his return. In 1929 he was appointed to the Retreats and Mission staff of the Irish Jesuits. His work entailed preaching at missions and religious retreats all over Ireland; as most of this work was necessarily performed on evenings and Sundays, he had considerable time to indulge in his hobby during the daytime. He took photographs of many parishes and towns in Ireland, and also photographed in London and East Anglia during his ecclesiastical travels to England.
Archivist David Davison summarised Browne's life work in 2014: "His first pictures in Cobh showed schooners sailing in the port, and by the end of his life, he was photographing Transatlantic aeroplanes at Shannon Airport. He was riveted by all of that".
Publication of the photographs.
Francis Browne died in Dublin in 1960 and was buried in the Jesuit plot in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin. His negatives lay forgotten for 25 years after his death; they were found by chance in 1985 when Father Edward E. O'Donnell, SJ, discovered them in a large metal trunk, once belonging to Browne, in the Irish Jesuit archives. "When the trunk was opened in 1985, people compared him to the greats like Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Doisneau, but his work predated theirs by decades", archivist David Davison later recalled.
O'Donnell brought the negatives to the attention of several publishers. The "Titanic" photographs were published in 1997 as "Father Browne’s Titanic Album" with text by E. E. O'Donnell (Fr. Eddie O’Donnell). In all, at least 25 volumes of Browne's photographs have now been published. The features editor of "The Sunday Times" of London called this "the photographic equivalent to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls". Many of these books have become best-sellers, the latest being the Centenary Edition of "Father Browne's Titanic Album" in 2012 by Messenger Publications, Dublin.
The Irish province of the Jesuits (the Society of Jesus), the owner of the negatives pursuant to Browne's will, engaged photographic restoration specialists David and Edwin Davison to preserve and catalogue the fragile and unstable negatives. The Davisons made copies of every negative and are in the process of transferring every usable image to a digital format for future generations. The Davisons later acquired the rights to the photographs and still own the rights as Davison &amp; Associates.
Browne became better known with his appearance (April 2012) on the commonest Irish postage stamp (55 cents) to mark the centenary of the sinking of the "Titanic".
The twenty-fifth book of his photographs, "Father Browne's Laois", was produced in Dublin by Messenger Publications in October 2013. The same publisher issued an updated biography, "The Life and Lens of Father Browne" in 2014. An hour-long documentary film on Browne's next book, detailing his experiences as an army chaplain during the Great War, appeared on RTÉ (Ireland's national broadcaster). "Father Browne's First World War" was then issued by Messenger Publications.
Yale University Press published a volume of Fr Browne's best photographs, entitled "Frank Browne: A Life through the Lens", by Colin Ford, E. E. O'Donnell SJ, David Davison (Editor) and Edwin Davison (Editor), in early 2015. An exhibition of these pictures was opened by the Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) of Ireland, Joan Burton, at the Farmleigh Gallery in Dublin, running to Christmas 2014.
During 2015 Browne's Dublin photographs were re-published as was a new selection of his pictures of County Donegal. By April 2016 there were no fewer than five Father Browne Exhibitions circulating in two continents.
In 2016, Messenger Publications published 100 of Browne's photographs of Irish aviation from the early 20th century in "Flying with Father Browne", by Eddie O'Donnell SJ.

The Great Love (1942 film)

The Great Love (German: Die große Liebe) is a 1942 German drama film directed by Rolf Hansen and starring Zarah Leander, Viktor Staal and Grethe Weiser. It premiered in Berlin in 1942 and went on to become the most commercially successful film in the history of the Third Reich.
It was shot at the Tempelhof Studios with location shooting taking place in Berlin, Rome and Vienna. The film's sets were designed by the art director Walter Haag.
Story.
The attractive Oberleutnant Paul Wendlandt is stationed in North Africa as a Luftwaffe fighter pilot. While in Berlin to deliver a report he is given a day's leave, and on the stage of the cabaret theatre "Skala" sees the popular Danish singer Hanna Holberg. For Paul it is love at first sight. When Hanna visits friends after the end of the performance, he follows her, and speaks to her in the U-Bahn. After the party in her friends' flat he accompanies her home, and chance throws them further together when an air raid warning forces them to take cover in the air raid shelter. Hanna reciprocates Paul's feelings, but after a night spent together Paul has to return immediately to the front.
There now follows a whole series of misunderstandings, and one missed opportunity after another. While Hanna waits in vain for some sign of life from Paul, he is flying on missions in North Africa. When he tries to visit her in her Berlin flat, she is giving a Christmas concert in Paris. Nevertheless, their bond grows in strength and arouses the jealousy of the composer Rudnitzky, who is also in love with the singer. Paul asks Hanna in a letter to marry him. However, when he is finally able to visit her, he is called away again on the night before the wedding. Hanna, disappointed, leaves for Rome, where she has to make a guest appearance. Even when Paul manages to get three weeks' leave and follows Hanna to Rome, the wedding has still to be postponed: Paul feels so strongly that he is needed at the front that he goes back even though he has not been ordered to do so. Hanna does not understand this, and there is an argument, after which Paul thinks he has lost her forever.
Germany invades the Soviet Union and Paul and his friend Etzdorf are sent to the Eastern Front. When Etzdorf is killed, Paul writes a farewell letter to Hanna, to make the dangers of his missions easier to bear. Only when he himself has been shot down and wounded and is sent to a military hospital in the mountains does he see Hanna again, who is still prepared to marry him. The last shots of the film show the happy couple, confident in the future, looking skywards where squadrons of German bombers fly past.
Musical numbers.
All the songs were composed by Michael Jary, with lyrics by Bruno Balz and sung by Zarah Leander. "Davon geht die Welt nicht unter" and "Ich weiß, es wird einmal ein Wunder gescheh'n" were two of the biggest hits of the National Socialist period, and because of their political subtexts were much approved of and promoted by the authorities. After 1942, as the military situation became more and more unfavourable to Germany, they became a staple element of the prevalent informal propaganda geared to "seeing it through".
Nowadays, "Ich weiss, es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehen" and "Davon geht die Welt nicht unter" are idioms in German language.
National Socialist propaganda.
In its blend of entertainment and propaganda elements the film is paradigmatic for National Socialist cinema in much the same way as "Wunschkonzert", after "Die große Liebe" the next most popular film of the National Socialist period. While on the one hand the suspensefully presented love story, with its images of the North African desert, Paris and Rome, as well as the extravagant show numbers, constitutes an invitation to dream, yet on the other hand "Die große Liebe" urges adjustment to the realities of war at all levels. Not love, but war, is the real theme of the film. This is despite omitting any background for, or events in, the war.
The film does not just contain original material from the "Die Deutsche Wochenschau" with pictures of German attacks on the English channel coast: the war determines the whole action of the film. The lesson that Hanna Holberg, and with her the entire public, has to absorb, is the insignificance of individual striving for happiness in times in which higher values - here, the military victory of Germany in World War II - come to the fore. The film does not gain its political impact by simply urging renunciation or "going without" in difficult times, but by setting off individual happiness against duties which go far beyond the requirements of ordinary military duties. Paul is not concerned about behaving with military correctness, but about his desire to make his contribution to Germany's military victory. He renounces Hanna, not because of military orders recalling him to the front but in order to serve the national cause and if necessary to sacrifice his life for Germany. In the process Hanna learns that waiting and renunciation in war have not only to be accepted as fate, but constitute the really "great love". She learns to bravely send him back to his squadron, singing, "The World's Not Going To End Because of This."
The film owes by far the greatest part of its attractiveness to Zarah Leander's performance. When she was selected for the role she had already established a strong profile as an expressive portrayer of self-aware, mature, emotionally stable women, whose plans and lives were thrown into disarray by unexpected blows of fate. The director Rolf Hansen, working with her here for the second time, had the good idea of teaming her up with a weak and relatively insignificant male lead, who was scarcely capable of playing against the weight of her presence. The suffering laid upon Hanna Holberg by her unfulfilled love gained by the fact that she was profoundly misunderstood, an important additional element that deeply impressed the public.
In order to impress also by its modernity, the film took the risk of making - for the time - an unprecedentedly realistic representation of day-to-day wartime life, and shows rationing of food, air raid warnings and hours spent waiting in air raid shelters. Admittedly it never shows these things without taking care always to point out how to maintain at all times care for others and good humour, however difficult the circumstances. All levels of society are depicted as pitching in together, with the heroine coming to know those of much lower social level in the course of the film. Hanna learns thereby to overcome her snobbishness, manifested in her singing for wounded soldiers.
The depiction of Zarah Leander was also unusual, in that in this film she wore ordinary day clothes, lived in a normal Berlin rented flat and even travelled on the U-Bahn.
Production and reception.
The interior scenes for "Die große Liebe" were filmed from 23 September 1941 to early October 1941 in the Tobis-Sascha-Studio in Vienna - better known as the Rosenhügel Film Studios - and in the Carl Froelich sound studio in Berlin-Tempelhof. The exterior scenes had been filmed in Berlin and Rome by the middle of March 1942. The film was submitted to the Film Censor's Office on 10 June 1942 (Prüf-Nr. B. 57295) when it had a length of 2,738 metres or 100 minutes and was classified as suitable for minors and for public holiday viewing. It was distributed by the UFA-owned Deutsche Filmvertriebs GmbH (DFV). On 18 April 1944 it was re-submitted, now with a length of 2,732 metres (B. 60163), and was re-classified as before.
The premiere took place on 12 June 1942 in Berlin, in the Germania-Palast cinema on the Frankfurter Allee and the UFA-Palast am Zoo cinema. "Die große Liebe" became the greatest commercial film success of the Third Reich. It was seen by 27 million spectators and took 8 million Reichsmarks, having cost 3 million to produce (equivalent to and million euros). The Film Censor's Office pronounced it "politically valuable", '"artistically valuable" and "valuable for the people" - a combination of accolades also granted, for example, to Gerhard Lamprecht's nationalist hero biography "Diesel" (also 1942).
After the end of World War II the Allied Control Commission forbade the film to be screened. In 1963 however it was submitted to the FSK, who approved its re-release subject to cuts, which were however disregarded by the distributors: the film was shown with a preliminary warning but with no cuts. Further cuts were made in 1980 for release on home video, approved by the FSK for audiences age 6 and up.
The original version of "Die große Liebe" was submitted to the FSK in 1997 and approved for release to audiences over the age of 18. This completely uncut version, running 100 minutes (approximately 97 mins in the PAL video format) is commercially available as a video and DVD in Germany. Distribution rights are now the property of Transit-Film GmbH.

William Bernard Ziff Jr.

William Bernard "Bill" Ziff Jr. (June 24, 1930 – September 9, 2006) was an American publishing executive. His father, William Bernard Ziff Sr., was the co-founder of Ziff Davis Inc. and when the elder Ziff died in 1953, Ziff took over the management of the company. After buying out partner Bernard G. Davis, he led Ziff Davis to become the most successful publisher of technology magazines in the 1970s and 1980s.
Biography.
He was born on June 24, 1930, to Bill Ziff Sr., a Jewish American publishing executive and author, and his second wife, Amelia Mary Morton. He was mainly raised in Miami, and then moved with his family to Sarasota, in 1947. A polymath with a photographic memory, he graduated from Rutgers University in 1951, then studied philosophy in West Germany. In 1953, after the death of his father, he moved to New York City to lead Ziff Davis Inc. Four years later, he bought out co-founder Bernard Davis, who then launched Davis Publications Inc. Ziff then re-directed the company toward enthusiast magazines and trade publications, with the acquisition of such titles as "Car and Driver", "Popular Electronics", "PC Magazine", "World Aviation Directory" and "Computer Shopper".
By focusing on enthusiast and trade publications, Ziff's salesmen were able to directly target advertisers who wanted to market to a specific audience. His approach was very successful: manufacturers and retailers were eager to advertise in his magazines at a time when general-interest publications were largely suffering from declining advertising sales.
In 1978, Ziff was diagnosed with prostate cancer, with a prognosis of only a few years to live. In 1984, he sold most of the consumer and business magazines for US$712.5 million keeping a few computer titles like "PC Magazine". His computer magazines pioneered the format of conducting sophisticated technical tests of computer products; as a result, their reviews would often make or break the introduction of new personal computers, modems, or CD-ROM drives. During the rapid-growth genesis of personal computing, Ziff Davis quickly became the dominant computer publishing firm in the world. Ziff had wanted to turn the business over to his sons – Daniel, Dirk and Robert – but they did not desire the responsibility. In 1994, he announced the sale of the publishing group to Forstmann Little &amp; Company for US$1.4 billion. The sale of the electronic publishing unit occurred later.
Personal life and death.
In 1963, Ziff married Barbara Ingrid Beitz in a Methodist ceremony. She was the daughter of the German industrialist Berthold Beitz and his wife Elsa, who were recognized by Yad Vashem (the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority) as "Righteous among the Nations", for being the rare example among ethnic Germans by providing refuge and risking their lives to save Jews during World War II. They had three sons: Dirk Edward Ziff (b. 1965); Robert D. Ziff (b. 1967); Daniel M. Ziff (b. 1973). His sons are principals of Ziff Brothers Investments, in Manhattan and Greenwich, Connecticut; they were named on the 2012 Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans, with an aggregate net worth of approximately $12.6 billion.
Ziff later married future Metropolitan Opera chair Tamsen Ann Kojis, daughter of Dr. Ferdinand Kojis and Harriet Henderson (also known as noted opera soprano Harriet Henders who performed with famed conductors Arturo Toscanini and George Szell). Ziff died from prostate cancer in Pawling, New York, where he lived with Kojis.

Curriculum framework

A curriculum framework is an organized plan or set of standards or learning outcomes that defines the content to be learned in terms of clear, definable standards of what the student should know and be able to do.
A curriculum framework is part of an outcome-based education or standards based education reform design. The framework is the second step, defining clear, high standards which will be achieved by all students. The curriculum is then aligned to the standards, and students are assessed against the standards. As compared with traditional education which is concerned only about delivering content, a standards based education reform system promises that all will succeed if all are held to high expectations. When the standards are reached, there will be no achievement gap where some groups are allowed to score lower than others, or the disabled are offered different opportunities than others. All will meet world class standards and be qualified for good colleges and trained for good jobs which pay good wages. In a traditional education system, the curriculum was defined by those who created textbooks rather than government bodies which assembled groups of stakeholders to create standards based on consensus of what students should know and be able to do.
In some states, curriculum frameworks have been adopted based on traditional academic standards rather than outcome-based constructivist standards, but many frameworks were originally or still based on student-centered learning and constructivism such as reform mathematics, whole language and Inquiry-based Science which have been controversial in some states and communities. High school graduation examinations tie awarding of diplomas to demonstration of meeting the standards set out in the frameworks.

Mats Rubarth

Mats Carl Rickard Rubarth (born 25 January 1977) is a Swedish musician and former footballer, who played most of his senior career for AIK. He won one cap for the Sweden national team.
Football career.
Club career.
Rubarth was a technical left-winger who liked to dribble past defenders from the left side of the pitch, even though he was right footed. He regularly provided strikers with good passes and consequently got quite a few assists during his career. During the 2003 season, which arguably was Rubarth's best, he also proved to be an able goal scorer, scoring ten times that season in Allsvenskan. One of his more famous goals was however scored in 2001 against local rivals Hammarby IF when he scored with a spectacular bicycle kick.
Though not a physical player, Rubarth picked up a staggering amount of yellow cards and quite a few red cards too. In 2003, he managed to get sent-off twice in a row. First against Helsingborgs IF in Allsvenskan and then in the next match against Fylkir in the UEFA Cup.
Despite his on-pitch temper problems, Rubarth was very popular at AIK's home ground Råsunda for several reasons, including his entertaining style and commitment to the club. On 31 October 2008 it was announced that he would quit the team after the current season and that the match against Helsingborgs IF two days later would be his last at Råsunda. He came on with 10 minutes left to play and received the love from the fans one last time. Rubarth left the club in January 2009, retiring from football at age 31.
International career.
Rubarth represented the Sweden U17 and U21 teams a total of two times before making his full international debut for the Sweden national team on 22 January 2004 in a friendly game against Norway. He played for 58 minutes before being replaced by Lasse Nilsson in a 0–3 loss.
Music career.
An accomplished recording artist and composer, he previously recorded as a solo artist. He plays bass guitar in the Swedish glam-rock supergroup Casablanca. He is a member of the italo disco group Italove and has worked with noted artists in the genre, like Gazebo and Ken Laszlo.

Jacob Henry "Ol' Jake" Eisenhart (October 3, 1922 – December 20, 1987) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who appeared in one game for the Cincinnati Reds in 1944. The 6'3½", 195 lb. left-hander was a native of Perkasie, Pennsylvania.
Eisenhart is one of many ballplayers who only appeared in the major leagues during World War II. After attending Juniata College, he was signed by the Reds to a 30-day trial contract, but his only big league action came on June 10, in a home game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Crosley Field. He entered the game with two out in the top of the ninth inning, and the Reds behind 18–0. The pitcher he came in to relieve was 15-year-old Joe Nuxhall, who had just made his major league debut. Eisenhart walked the first batter he faced, George Fallon, then got the last out, retiring opposing pitcher Mort Cooper on a foul out. His total major league experience ended up lasting only 1/3 of an inning. He was released by the Reds on June 24. Eisenhart also served in the Army during World War II, and toiled three years in the Philadelphia Athletics organization, but never made it back to the major leagues. He died in 1987 in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.

Dane Byers

Dane Byers (born February 21, 1986) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He last played for and captained Manchester Storm of the UK's EIHL. He was originally drafted by the New York Rangers 48th overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft.
Playing career.
Junior.
Byers began his junior hockey career with the Prince Albert Raiders of the WHL in 2002-03, where he scored eight goals and 14 points in 49 games. Byers returned to the Raiders in 2003-04, as he scored nine goals and 17 points in 51 games, then he added a goal and three points in six playoff games. Byers appeared in 65 games with the Raiders in 2004-05, scoring 11 goals and 20 points, while accumulating 181 penalty minutes. Byers had a strong playoff run, scoring four goals and 10 points in 17 games. Byers broke out offensively in the 2005-06 season, scoring 21 goals and 48 points in 71 games; however, the Raiders failed to qualify for the playoffs.
Professional.
After his junior season ended with the Prince Albert Raiders, the New York Rangers assigned Byers to the Hartford Wolf Pack to finish the 2005-06 season. Byers had two assists in five games with Hartford. He spent the entire 2006-07 season with the Wolf Pack, where Byers had 17 goals and 47 points, along with 213 penalty minutes in 78 games. In seven playoff games, Byers scored two goals. Byers returned to Hartford for the 2007-08 season, where he had 23 goals and 46 points in 73 games. In five playoff games, Byers had a goal and three points. He also made his NHL debut during the 2007-08 NHL season, going pointless in one game with the New York Rangers.
Byers missed most of the 2008–09 season due to a knee injury suffered during a game against the Worcester Sharks on October 31, 2008. In nine games, Byers had four goals and seven points, and he returned for the playoffs for Hartford, where Byers had three goals and four points in six games. Byers rebounded from his injury shortened season in 2009–10, as he had 25 goals and 52 points in 74 games with the Wolf Pack. Byers also appeared in five games with the Rangers, scoring his first NHL goal against Niklas Bäckström of the Minnesota Wild on October 30, 2009. Several days later, Byers was given an automatic one-game suspension by the NHL for instigating a fight with forward Tanner Glass in the final five minutes of a 4–1 loss to the Vancouver Canucks on November 3.
Byers began the 2010–11 season with Hartford, where in 16 games he had three goals and nine points. On November 11, 2010, the Rangers traded Byers to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Chad Kolarik.
The Blue Jackets assigned Byers to the AHL's Springfield Falcons, where he had nine goals and 25 points in 48 games. Byers was once again on the move, as on February 28, 2011, Byers and Rostislav Klesla were traded from the Blue Jackets to the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for Scottie Upshall and Sami Lepistö. As a result of the mid-season trades, Byers was able to set an AHL record for most games played in a season, with 85. But, on July 11, 2011, he was signed to go back to the Jackets. On January 16, 2012, Byers was given a three-game suspension by the NHL for an illegal check to the head of Andrew Desjardins during a game against the San Jose Sharks on January 14, 2012.
On July 5, 2012, the Edmonton Oilers signed Byers to a one-year, two-way contract. He was assigned to the Oilers' AHL affiliate, the Oklahoma City Barons, to begin the 2012–13 season. On April 2, 2013, he was traded to the Washington Capitals in exchange for Garrett Stafford.
On June 26, 2013, despite no contract extension with Washington, Byers signed a one-year contract to remain with the Capitals' AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears.
After two seasons as captain of the Bears, Byers left North America and signed a try-out contract with Finnish Liiga club Ilves on September 22, 2015. In his first stint overseas, Byers recorded two goals in six games with Ilves before signing with rivals Lahti Pelicans for the remainder of the season on October 12, 2015.
On May 23, 2016, Byers signed with Kölner Haie of the German Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL).
On 1 June 2017, Byers moved to the United Kingdom to sign for Elite Ice Hockey League club Manchester Storm.
Byers played for two years in Manchester, the second as captain, before retiring in April 2019.
Family.
Byers' brother Cole Byers was also a professional hockey player who played for the Hull Stingrays in the British Elite Ice Hockey League. The brothers are also cousins of former NHL enforcer-turned-radio host Lyndon Byers.

County of Cerdanya

The County of Cerdanya (, ; ; , ) was one of the Catalan counties formed in the last decades of the 8th century by the Franks in the "Marca Hispanica". The original Cerdanya consisted of the valley of the upper Segre. Today Cerdanya is a Catalan "comarca".
Origins.
The region had been conquered by the Moors in the early 8th century. In 731, the Moorish governor of Cerdanya allied himself with Odo the Great by marrying his daughter, at Odo's insistence, in order to secure his southern frontier from further Muslim expansion. Cerdanya was at this time predominantly Basque, and Odo had a pro-Basque policy in the face of Charles Martel and the Franks. 
Moorish rule was soon purely nominal; the Cerdanya was conquered by Charlemagne shortly after the surrender of Girona in 785. The first Count of Cerdanya that we know of by name was Borrell I (798), who was subject to the Count of Toulouse. At this date, Cerdanya was united in government under one count with County of Besalú and Urgell; it was part of the after 817. Cerdanya and Urgell remained united until 897 and both were under the influence and often control of the Count of Aragon. In 842, the Emirate of Córdoba invaded Cerdanya in an attempt to regain the Pyrenees, but they were repulsed by Count Sunifred.
In the 9th century, Cerdanya was the centre of a region wherein the "aprisio" form of landholding was common. In 835, a charter of Louis the Pious even forbid the church of the region to grant lands "in beneficium", that is, as benefices or in feudal tenure. 
After the death of Louis the Stammerer (879), Aquitaine and West Francia in general experienced a period of instability during which the outlying regions, such as Catalonia, became "de facto" independent of central royal authority. During this period as well, the office of count became "de facto" hereditary.
Division and reunion.
The 10th century saw repeated divisions and reunions of the familial lands of the Bellonids and Cerdanya was repeatedly attached to and detached from its neighbouring regions and counties. The counts of Cerdanya frequently used the title "marchio", meaning margrave, during this period. This was an indication of their status as frontier lords and of the breakdown in royal authority, which permitted regional magnates to assume whatever titles they wished without incurring royal disfavour. As another result of its frontier location and the lack of royal control exercised over it, Cerdanya was dotted with numerous castles during this period, when the Muslim threat was still strong. 
In 897, Wilfred the Hairy died having divided his vast Catalan patrimony (technically just a plurality of public offices) between his four sons. Cerdanya, Conflent, and Berga went to Miro. The Fenouillèdes and Capcir were also annexed to Cerdanya at this time. From 913 to 920, Miro also held Besalú, but on his death in 927, his territories were divided between his four sons. The eldest, Sunifred, received Cerdanya and a certain primacy over his brothers. In the last half of the 10th century, the counties of Miro were reunited (984) under one ruler: Oliba Cabreta. 
His county comprised Besalú, the Fenouillèdes, Capcir, the Baridà, the Valley of Ribes, that of Lillet, the Berguedà, the Ripollés, the Vallespir, the upper plain of Roussillon from Illa de Tet to Sant Esteve del Monasterio, Conflent, the Donasà, and Peyrepertuse. Oliba's counties and the counties of Borrell II, Count of Barcelona, formed the two main divisions of Catalonia during the latter half of the 10th century. Oliba brought Cerdanya to its zenith. He expanded his lordship to the north into the County of Carcassonne and to the west into the Counties of Roussillon and Empúries. He extended his authority over the churches of Sant Joan de les Abadesses and Lagrasse and usurped the "de facto" supremacy in Catalonia from Borrell II of Barcelona. In 988, Oliba Cabreta retired to the monastery of Montecassino and divided his lands between his three sons, the second-born, Wilfred, receiving Cerdanya and Conflent. In 1002, Berga was annexed to Cerdanya. 
It is clear, however, from evidence dating from between 987 and 1031, that the Carolingian court system and Visigothic law were still in effect in Cerdanya. The count presided over judicial tribunals with the assistance of the "judices" (judges) and "boni homines" (good men) of the county.
Feudalisation and decline.
During the 11th century, Cerdanya became increasingly feudalised and drawn into the orb of Toulouse and Foix. The counts of Toulouse desired to control the pass of Pimorent () in Cerdanya, and those of Foix desired some control of the frontier with Moorish Lérida. The counts of Cerdanya, for their part, were interested in furthering their control of the church in the Midi and Catalonia; they had already controlled the important monasteries of Sant Miquel de Cuixà and Ripoll since the early 10th century. In 1016, they purchased the right to the archbishopric of Narbonne for 100,000 "solidi" for their relative Guifred and, not long after, that to the bishopric of Urgell as well. The famous Abbot Oliva was a member of the ruling dynasty of Cerdanya. When Count Raymond Wilfred plundered the Sant Miquel de Cuixà and entered into a feud with the Bishop of Elne, it gave the nobles opportunity to grant their services to whoever offered them the most advantage at the moment. 
In this period of political confusion, the viscount Bernard Sunifred rebelled. His lands were clustered in the north of Cerdanya, in the Segre valley and Conflent with their centre at Merencs. He put his lands under the nominal suzerainty of the count of Toulouse and tried to draw them away from Cerdanya. Bernard was forced to make peace with Raymond in 1047 and his allodial lands were handed over, though he was compensated with more fiefdoms from the count. Bernard rebelled a second time and was forced to make peace again in 1061. The important pass of Pimorent, which, now that Cerdanya was no longer a marcher territory, lay at the centre of its existence, remained in the hands of the Count Raymond and neither of Bernard's allies of Toulouse or Foix. 
The viscounts of Cerdanya and the others regions, like Conflent and Fenouillèdes, were the main antagonists of the comital power in Cerdanya throughout the 11th century. Briefly, William Raymond had to fight a war (successfully) with Giselbert II of Roussillon over the possession of the monastery of Cuixà, which Cerdanya had controlled throughout the 10th century, but in the main, the viscounts were the greatest military detriment to the counts of Cerdanya. Between 1088 and 1092, William founded Vilafranca de Conflent. William's successor, William Jordan, joined the First Crusade, and in his absence, the counts' authority was weakened still further. In 1118, Cerdanya was sold to Barcelona and only occasionally bestowed thereafter as appanage for younger sons. 
The failure of the county of Cerdanya to establish lasting supremacy over Catalonia lies in the penchant of its counts to divide their patrimony between all of their sons — and the rights of inheritance of brothers — and the gathering strength of the nobility following the decline of Cerdanya's military importance. In 1058, when Count Raymond accepted the pay of Raymond Berengar I of Barcelona to be his ally in the fight against the Moors, the fate of Cerdanya to be in the control of Barcelona was sealed. In the next centuries, Cerdanya was part of the Principality of Catalonia.

Hereditary counts.
The title then passed finally and permanently to the Crown of Aragon.
In the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), the northern half of the County was definitively ceded to the Kingdom of France.
