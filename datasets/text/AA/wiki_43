Elizabeth Gould (illustrator)

Elizabeth Gould (; 18 July 1804 – 15 August 1841) was a British artist and illustrator at the forefront of the natural history movement. Elizabeth traveled and worked alongside her husband, naturalist and author John Gould. She produced illustrations and lithographs for ornithological works, including plates in Darwin's "The Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle" and the Goulds' seminal work, "The Birds of Australia". In total, Elizabeth is credited with at least 650 works.
Life and artistic career.
Elizabeth was born on 18 July 1804 in Ramsgate, England to a military family. Little is known of her early life, however it is likely that Elizabeth underwent training in drawing and botany from a young age. In Victorian England, botany and natural history were part of the education of girls in middle-class English families. As Ann Moyal stated, "Cultivated women drew, walked, observed, collected specimens, arranged and painted."
When aged twenty-two, Elizabeth was employed as a governess, and lived in James Street, London. It is known that she met John Gould through her brother, Charles Coxen, who was a fellow taxidermist. She married John in January 1829, when they were both 24 years old. Elizabeth began her professional work-life by producing ornithological drawings intended to supplement John's ornithological writing in letters to colleagues. Her first published work was in 1832 with "A Century of Birds from the Himalaya Mountains". Lacking a publisher, the Goulds decided to publish it themselves.
In the early days of the couple's partnership, Elizabeth provided an income for her family through selling her drawings. John encouraged her to learn lithography and asked his collaborator Edward Lear to teach her. The extent of Lear's direct influence on the artist is uncertain, but they moved in a circle of artists and natural historians working on similar publications. Elizabeth's work entailed making designs, compositions, and detailed observations of depictions of exotic birds, so that the works could be made into lithographic reproductions. In addition to that, Elizabeth made watercolor paintings accompanied with color keys for colorists to copy. All of the group were enthused with the depiction and scientific illustration of the unknown animals found on European expeditions, especially the novelties in English collections of Australian birds and mammals.
Once proficient with the art form, she created illustrations from John's more rudimentary drawings. Elizabeth's knowledge of art and her skills were not handed to her by her husband. Their skills were complementary and the pair worked together to make significant advances in the world of natural history and ornithology. The Goulds skilfully emphasised the aesthetic value of nature, while educating those around them about new species, nurturing a need for the representations of birds and other species. In her eleven-year career (1830–1841), Elizabeth designed, lithographed and painted more than 650 plates, which appeared in:
Elizabeth's early illustrations have been described as stiff, but they improved with experience. They are quite formal compositions, due to their use in ornithological classification.
The Goulds and the oldest of their surviving four children travelled to Australia in 1838. Elizabeth spent much of her time in Hobart as a guest of British explorer Jane Franklin. John travelled extensively collecting specimens and Elizabeth drew and painted them. Her brother Charles Coxen also migrated to Australia, where he and his wife Elizabeth Coxen, who were also interested in natural history, became members of the Queensland Philosophical Society.
While in Australia, Elizabeth made hundreds of drawings from specimens for the publications "Birds of Australia" and "A Monograph of the Macropodidæ", or "Family of Kangaroos", as well as illustrations for the ornithology volume of Charles Darwin's "Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Beagle".
She bore one son while living in Australia, and gave birth to their eighth child when they returned to England in 1840. Elizabeth did not live to see the completion of her research, dying of puerperal fever shortly after the birth of her last child.
Gould completed 84 plates for the monumental, seven-volume book, "The Birds of Australia", before her death. Henry Constantine Richter (H.C. Richter) was employed by John Gould following Elizabeth's death, and worked on completing the illustrations in "The Birds of Australia". The sketches of Elizabeth and Richter are difficult to distinguish from each other. Likely, her sketches informed the work of Richter. Though new artists were found to illustrate John's books, it is evident that he was devastated by the loss of Elizabeth. He never remarried and honored his wife for the extent of her involvement in his work.
Legacy and commemoration.
A complete account of her life, "The Story of Elizabeth Gould," was published by Alec Chisholm in 1944. Little was known about her until 1938, when a collection of her letters written from Australia was discovered, which were the basis for the book. Now housed in the Mitchell Library, the letters reveal Elizabeth as a charming, cultured, talented woman, both a musically and artistically. A more recent book showcases hundreds of Gould's illustrations and documents her impressive yet short career as scientific illustrator. 
The Gouldian finch ("Chloebia gouldiae") and Mrs. Gould's sunbird ("Aethopyga gouldiae") were named in her honor. John Gould named the Gouldian Finch in memory of his wife, stating "It was with feelings of the purest affection that I ventured, in the folio edition, to dedicate this lovely bird to the memory of my late wife, who for many years laboriously assisted me with her pencil, accompanied me to Australia, and cheerfully interested herself in all my pursuits." Mrs. Gould's sunbird was also named for Elizabeth, this time by Nicholas Vigors, a friend of the Gould's and contributor to John Gould's work.
Although the Goulds spent less than two years in Australia, "The Birds of Australia" remains the definitive work on the subject.
A copy of "A Century of Birds from the Himalaya Mountains", illustrated by Gould, and the property of Sir Stephen Glynne by original subscription, held ever since by the Gladstone family of Hawarden Castle, was offered for auction by Chrisities estimate £20,000–30,000 in July 2023.
Attribution and contemporary scholarship.
There is a growing body of critical research exploring the attribution of Elizabeth's work to her husband. His own role in producing the lithographs has been questioned and examples of his style of drawing have been examined, which suggest that the actual drawing and coloring is likely to have been the sole work of Elizabeth.
Her role as sole artist of their first collection "A Century of Birds from the Himalaya Mountains" was acknowledged on every lithograph, with the attribution "Drawn from Nature and on Stone by E. Gould." Subsequent collections used "J &amp; E Gould". "Birds of Australia" includes a number of attributions to "J &amp; E Gould". Scholars feel that Elizabeth's exhaustive work creating an archive of preparatory drawings for the lithographs before her death was not adequately recognized.
Portrayals in popular media.
Elizabeth is the principal character in the 2016 novel, "The Birdman's Wife", written by Melissa Ashley, which won the University of Queensland Fiction Book Award in the 2017 Queensland Literary Awards.

Trinity Lutheran Seminary

Trinity Lutheran Seminary at Capital University (formerly the German Theological Seminary of the Ohio Synod; the Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary, ELTS; and Trinity Lutheran Seminary) is a seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio.
History.
In 1830, the German Theological Seminary of the Ohio Synod, later known as the Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary (ELTS), was founded to meet the need for educating pastors in the Ohio region. It generally used the German language in its education and materials for its first few decades. It began in Canton, Ohio, but soon moved to Columbus, the state capital, and located in the suburban neighborhood of Bexley. It was operated by the Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio and Other States (known in short as the Joint Synod of Ohio), which also used the German language. The Joint Synod existed from 1818 until its merger in 1930 with two smaller German-language regional synods (the Iowa Synod and the Buffalo Synod) into the first denomination known as the American Lutheran Church. During these decades, the seminary was run as the theological department of the nearby Capital University, which had been chartered by the Joint Synod in 1850. The seminary was, as a result, known as "Capital Seminary". In 1960, the American Lutheran Church merged with other Lutheran churches to form The American Lutheran Church (ALC), the second denomination with that name.
With the growing closeness and theological friendships during the mid-20th century between major American Lutheran traditions, the decision was made in 1974 to consolidate ELTS and nearby Hamma Divinity School. Hamma was founded in 1845 as the Theological Department of Wittenberg College, in Springfield, Ohio, and was associated with the regional Ohio Synod jurisdiction of the General Synod. The General Synod merged into the United Lutheran Church in America (ULCA) in 1917–1918, and the ULCA in turn merged in 1962 with several other Lutheran denominations into the Lutheran Church in America (LCA).
The merged institution, renamed Trinity Lutheran Seminary, opened its doors on September 1, 1978. For the decade from 1978 until the merger creating the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in 1988, Trinity was owned and operated jointly by the ALC and the LCA. At the time they were two of the three largest Lutheran bodies in the United States.
On January 1, 2018, Trinity rejoined the university that it founded in 1850, Capital University, to become Trinity Lutheran Seminary at Capital University.
Academics.
Trinity Lutheran Seminary is accredited and its degree programs are approved by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and by the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.
Trinity offers First Professional degrees of Master of Divinity (M.Div.) and Master of Theological Studies (MTS).

Brunonia

Brunonia australis, commonly known as the blue pincushion or native cornflower, is a perennial or annual herb that grows widely across Australia. It is found in woodlands, open forest and sand plains. In Cronquist's classification scheme it was the sole member of the monogeneric plant family Brunoniaceae. The APG II system moved it into Goodeniaceae, with which it shares the stylar pollen-cup, or indusium, a character confined to these taxa. "Brunonia" is unique among Goodeniaceae in its radially symmetric flowers, the superior ovary and the absence of endosperm in the seeds.
The leaves are about 10 cm long and form a basal rosette. Flowering is usually in spring, with dense hemispherical clusters of numerous, small, bright blue flowers developing on several stems (scapes) up to 50 cm in height.
Taxonomy.
Specimens of "Brunonia" were first collected by Robert Brown during the 1801–02 voyage of HMS "Investigator" under the command of Matthew Flinders. The genus had not been published by early 1810, when members of the Linnean Society of London sought to name a plant genus in Brown's honour. This genus was settled upon because it was so difficult to classify: "The genus under consideration is... exceedingly interesting, on account of its apparent relationship to several very different natural orders, and the great difficulty of referring it to any one in particular." The name "Brunonia" was chosen because a genus had already been named "Brownea" in honour of Patrick Browne, and "Brunonia" was seen as a compromise, "preserving as much resemblance to his name as possible, while I avoid all ambiguity with the Brownea previously established."
In February 1810, James Edward Smith read a formal description of "Brunonia" to the Linnean Society. Two species were given: "Brunonia australis" and "Brunonia sericea". Later that year, Brown made use of Smith's names in his "Prodromus florae Novae Hollandiae". However, Smith's speech did not go to print until 1811, so priority of publication of the genus belongs to Brown not Smith. Thus Brown unwittingly violated a virtual botanical taboo, by naming a genus after himself.
"B. sericea" was reduced to a variety of "B. australis" in 1907, and given synonymy with "B. australis" in 1992. A number of other species and variety have been published, but to date none have survived as current taxa except "B. australis".
Cultivation.
This plant is easy to propagate from seed or by dividing existing plants. However, they can be difficult to establish and may die after a few years. They should be grown in well-drained soils either in full sun or partial shade.

14th King's Hussars

The 14th King's Hussars was a cavalry regiment in the British Army, first raised in 1715. It saw service for two centuries, including the First World War, before being amalgamated with the 20th Hussars to form the 14th/20th King's Hussars in 1922.
History.
Early wars.
The regiment was raised in the south of England by Brigadier-General James Dormer as James Dormer's Regiment of Dragoons, and ranked as the 14th Dragoons, in 1715 as part of the response to the Jacobite rebellion. It took part in the Battle of Preston in November 1715 after which it escorted some of the rebels to Lancaster Gaol. The regiment was sent to Ireland in 1717 and remained there until 1742. It fought but was completely outflanked at the Battle of Prestonpans in September 1745 and then took part in the equally disastrous Battle of Falkirk Muir in January 1746 during the Jacobite rising of 1745. The regiment returned to Ireland in 1747 and it was formally renamed as the 14th Regiment of Dragoons in 1751. It became a light dragoon regiment in 1776, as the 14th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons, and two troops were detached and joined 8th Light Dragoons in the Low Countries in 1794 for service in the Flanders Campaign. Then seven troops were detached and deployed to the French colony of Saint-Domingue in 1795 during the Haitian Revolution; they took part in an action at Mirebalais in June 1797 in which they helped defeat 1,200 ex-slaves who were sympathetic to new regime in France.
The regiment was renamed for Princess Frederica in 1798 as the 14th (The Duchess of York's Own) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons and allowed to use the Prussian Eagle as its badge. The regiment was dispatched to Lisbon in December 1808 to join Sir Arthur Wellesley's Army which was engaged in the Peninsular War. The regiment fought at the Second Battle of Porto in May 1809 during which one of the French brigade commanders, General Maximilien Foy, was wounded in an action involving a squadron of the regiment.
The regiment fought at the Battle of Talavera in July 1809 and saw hard action at Barquilla on 11 July 1810 during which the commanding officer of the regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Neil Talbot, and eight of his men were killed. The regiment, now under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Felton Hervey-Bathurst, then took part in a skirmish on the Coa river on 24 July 1810 and, in pressing home a frontal attack on a French artillery battery, a squadron of the regiment was badly mauled at the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro in May 1811. The following year was a very busy one for the regiment: the regiment fought at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812, the Siege of Badajoz in March 1812, the Battle of Villagarcia in April 1812 and the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812.
During the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813 the regiment captured a silver chamberpot belonging to King Joseph Bonaparte, brother of the Emperor Napoleon, which resulted in the regimental nickname of "The Emperor's Chambermaids". The chamberpot, named "The Emperor", is still retained by their successor regiment the King's Royal Hussars. The regiment advanced into France performing a supporting role at the Battle of Orthez in February 1814 and at the Battle of Toulouse in April 1814. The regiment went back to England in July 1814, but deployed two squadrons to North America where, dismounted, they took part in the Battle of New Orleans on 8 January 1815 in the closing stages of the War of 1812. The regiment served in Ireland between January 1816 and June 1819 and between April 1825 and March 1828.
The Victorian era.
The regiment was renamed in July 1830, to mark the coronation of William IV as the 14th (The King's) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons, and it took part in the suppression of the Bristol riots in October 1831. It was dispatched to India in May 1841. The regiment marched from Kirkee in the west of the country to Ambala in the north of the country through the winter of 1845 during the First Anglo-Sikh War.
The commanding officer of the regiment, Colonel William Havelock, led a charge, apparently without orders, at the Battle of Ramnagar in November 1848 during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Havelock and his leading troopers were surrounded and cut down. After a further charge failed, Brigadier Charles Cureton, the commander of the cavalry division to which the troops belonged, galloped up and ordered a retreat. Cureton himself was then killed by musket fire. The regiment were routed at the Battle of Chillianwala in January 1849 but redeemed themselves at the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849. It also took part in an expedition under Lieutenant-General Sir James Outram against Persia in spring 1857 during the Anglo-Persian War.
The regiment returned to India in May 1857 and took part in the Central Indian campaign during 1858 in the latter stages of the Indian Rebellion. Major James Leith was awarded the Victoria Cross during this campaign; the regiment were ordered home in February 1860. The title of the regiment was simplified in August 1861 to the 14th (King's) Hussars.
20th century.
The regiment arrived in South Africa in January 1900 and took part in the relief of Kimberley in February 1900 during the Second Boer War. The regiment, which was serving in Mhow in India as part of the Meerut Cavalry Brigade in the Meerut Divisional Area at the start of the First World War landed in Mesopotamia in November 1915. It was involved in most of the actions during the Mesopotamian campaign before moving to Persia in May 1918. The regiment retitled as the 14th King's Hussars in January 1921 and was amalgamated with the 20th Hussars to form the 14th/20th King's Hussars in October 1922.

Fabian Ware

Major-General Sir Fabian Arthur Goulstone Ware (17 June 186928 April 1949) was a British educator, journalist, and the founder of the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC), now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC). He also served as Director of Education for the Transvaal Colony and editor of "The Morning Post".
Ware was born in Clifton, Bristol, and graduated from the University of Paris in 1894. Several years after graduation, he travelled to the Transvaal Colony where, as a member of Milner's Kindergarten, he became Director of Education in 1903. Two years later, Ware became editor of "The Morning Post" and returned to England. While editor, he expanded the paper and reoriented it to focus on colonial affairs. After several controversies, culminating in a failed effort to purchase an airship for the United Kingdom, Ware was forced to retire in 1911.
When the First World War started in August 1914, Ware attempted to join the British Army but was rejected because he was too old. With the assistance of Alfred Milner, he obtained an appointment as the commander of a mobile ambulance unit provided by the British Red Cross Society. In this role he began marking and recording the graves of those killed. The unit soon began to focus exclusively on graves, and the organisation was transferred to the British Army in 1915. The following year the Army Department of Graves Registration and Enquiries was created with Ware at its head. On 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission was founded. Ware served as vice-chairman. He ended the war as a major-general, having been mentioned in despatches twice.
Post-war, Ware was heavily involved in the IWGC's function. He frequently led negotiations with foreign nations over cemeteries and memorials, dealt with prominent figures in the commission, and worked to ensure the commission's financial security. Ware also attempted to raise support for his ideal of cooperation between the Dominions. In the lead-up to the Second World War, he attempted to use the IWGC's work as a tool for ensuring peace. When war broke out, he continued to serve as vice-chairman of the IWGC and was re-appointed director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries. He retired from the Commission in 1948 and died the following year.
Early life.
Ware was born in Clifton, Bristol, on 17 June 1869 to Charles and Amy Carew Ware, Goulstone. He was privately tutored until his father died when he was 18. Ware then taught in private schools to pay for tuition at the University of London. Dissatisfied with his education, Ware left the university and after saving enough money began attending the University of Paris, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in 1894. He worked as an assistant schoolmaster from 1889 to 1899; the last four years at the Bradford Grammar School. While teaching, he was occasionally employed as an examiner for the Civil Service Commission. He married Anna Margaret (1868–1952) on 1 August 1895; they had a daughter and a son.
Transvaal.
Ware began contributing articles to "The Morning Post" in 1899. He served as the representative of the Education Committee of the Royal British Commission at the Exposition Universelle of 1900 in Paris and afterwards worked as an inspector of schools for the Board of Education. In October 1901 Ware was appointed assistant director of education in the Transvaal by Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner, becoming a member of an informal group of young Britons later known as Milner's Kindergarten. He moved to the Transvaal and stopped writing for "The Morning Post". As assistant director Ware chaired two committees in 1902 and 1903 on the topic of technical education in the colony. The Transvaal Technical Institute was created in early 1904 upon their recommendations. Ware served as chairman of the institute's council.
In early 1903 Ware became acting director of education when Edmund Beale Sargantthe director of education for the Transvaal and Orange River Colonyreturned to England in failing health. On 17 June 1903 Ware was made a member of the Transvaal Legislative Council, and in July he became permanent director of education for the Transvaal. Author wrote that as a member of the council Ware was "probably the only South African Superintendent of Education that has represented education "directly" before the legislature". Under Ware, the number of children in education in the Transvaal doubled in less than four years. As director, he advocated the eventual creation of a de-centralised system of education with responsibility largely in the hands of local authorities.
"The Morning Post".
When the editor-in-chief of "The Morning Post", James Nicol Dunn, resigned during the Russo–Japanese War, Ware had written to Oliver Borthwick and asked whether he could work on the paper's staff. Several years later, in April 1905, Lord Glenesk offered the editorship of "The Morning Post" to Ware, in part through Milner's influence. Ware accepted, and moved back to England, taking the position in March. Historian A. J. A. Morris wrote that Glenesk intended for Ware to "be the much needed new broom" for the paper. When Ware became editor, "The Morning Post" had no offices. Its staff worked instead in temporary wooden sheds. He began expanding the paper by hiring Richard Jebb as a contributor, who in turn hired many other correspondents.
The two began to focus the paper on the British Dominions, a move they presented as a means to increase the paper's circulation; though it allowed for new sources of advertising, the move did not lead to higher circulation. Ware aimed to make the paper "the authority on all colonial questions," and supported social and tariff reform. He invited radicals such as William Beveridge and R. H. Tawney to contribute to the paper. Shortly after beginning work, Ware came into conflict with Glenesk, who thought he should not promote tariff reform, and wrote asking Lord Glenesk's daughter, Lady Bathurst, to intervene and threatening to resign. As a result of his initiatives, Ware was disliked by some members of the paper's staff, particularly Spenser Wilkinson, the paper's leader writer, and E. E. Peacock, the paper's manager. Ware also supported Richard Jebb's campaign against respected conservative Robert Cecil for the Marylebone East Parliament seatwhich cost the paper readership.
After the First Moroccan Crisis in 1905, Ware campaigned heavily against war with Germany. He later said
When Glenesk died in November, Lady Bathurst became owner of the paper. Lady Bathurst and Ware generally got along as they both held a political stance firmly to the right - though Ware's instincts for social reform were very strong. Ware was involved in hiring Robbie Ross as an art editor for the paper in August 1908. After the Bosnian Crisis in 1908, Ware became further convinced that the United Kingdom was falling behind Germany in military strength, a stance Wilkinson did not agree with. In a letter to Wilkinson, Ware wrote that "The Morning Post" "should boldly point to the German danger" and "rub in the immediate necessity of universal military service and the re-organisation of naval matters". He said that if the newspaper did not adopt that stance, "I cannot... continue to accept the responsibility of its editorship." Wilkinson considered the letter "a demand that I should abandon my sincerity as a writer, that is commit suicide". He felt Ware wanted "to hasten a war with Germany while I hope it may be averted by proper attention to navy and army and by sound foreign policy".
In response to the perceived military deficiency of the United Kingdom and Germany's successful test of a Zeppelin, "The Morning Post" announced the creation of a National Airship Fund on 21 June 1909. The aim of the fund was to raise £20,000 through public subscription to purchase the United Kingdom an airship. Lady Bathurst contributed an initial £2,000 to the fund. Ware travelled to Paris in July and signed a contract for Lebaudy Frères to build the "Lebaudy Morning Post". In August, it was revealed that the "Daily Mail" had offered to pay for a hangar while an airship from Clément-Bayard was shipped to England. Ware rushed to ensure "The" "Morning Post"s airship arrived first, and by May 1910 he began helping plan the airship's route to England. However, the Clément-Bayard No.2, sponsored by "The" "Daily Mail", arrived in England on 16 October 1910. The War Office purchased the airship and the National Airship Fund was left out of negotiations. The "Lebaudy Morning Post" was damaged when it arrived in England ten days after the Clément-Bayard No.2 because its hangar was too small, and it crashed on its first test flight. Ware was accused by H. Massac Buist and Lancelot Julian Bathurst, the paper's manager and Lady Bathurst's brother-in-law, of financial mismanagement and poorly managing the paper. After threatening to sue Lancelot Julian Bathurst over libel, Ware was given £3,000 and agreed to retire. His retirement was announced on 14 June 1911.
After leaving "The Morning Post", Ware planned to create a weekly paper independent from political parties, with funding from various British Dominions. The project was unsuccessful. Ware became a special commissioner for Rio Tinto, negotiating with the French government. In 1912 he published "The Worker and His Country", which historians John Lack and Bart Ziino describe as "an alarmist diagnosis of social unrest in France and Britain". In the book, Ware advocated for land redistribution to ease tensions between British social classes.
First World War.
Mobile ambulance unit.
With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the Royal Automobile Club began assisting the war effort with the creation of the Royal Automobile Club Volunteer Force. On 12 September 1914 several members of the club volunteered their services to the British Red Cross, which established the Motor Ambulance Department. Warewho was 45 years oldhad been rejected from serving in the British Army because he was too old, and obtained an appointment to command a mobile Red Cross ambulance unit with the assistance of Lord Milner. He arrived in France and took command of the unit on 19 September 1914.
One of several Red Cross units in France, Ware's unit operated in northern France as a semi-autonomous command. He had a degree of independence afforded by the Joint Finance Committee of St John Ambulance and the Red Cross, who gave Ware his own operating budget for three-month periods. Ware was struck by the lack of an official mechanism for managing the graves of those killed and following British defeats at Mons and Le Cateau in September, Ware's unit began sharing information with Lord Robert Cecil, the head of the Red Cross's Wounded and Missing Department.
According to an Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) report, the original object of the unit was to "search for British wounded and missing in the district which had been overrun by the Germans during the retreat from Mons, and to convey them back to the British lines or to a British base". However, by early October 1914, the unit had begun extensively working with the French and handling their casualties. By mid-October, Ware's unit had added a medical staff and mobile light hospital. That month Ware visited an extension of the Béthune cemetery which had British graves not maintained and some not even recorded. He soon convinced the Red Cross to fund durable grave markers. By December, the unit had dealt with more than four thousand wounded soldiers.
Ware began to focus on searching for dead soldiers on battlefields in northern France. In February 1915 the unit asked Reginald Brade to help ensure the unit's continuing work and Ware unsuccessfully applied for a pass from the provost marshal at St Omer to continue grave work. The unit's usefulness as an ambulance group declined as French capabilities to handle their casualties increased. In early 1915 the commander of the French 10th Army Corps declined an offer of help from the unit. When the unit was disbanded in May 1915, it had dealt with 12,000 casualties and treated 1,000 at its hospital.
Graves Registration Commission.
Ware met with the Adjutant-General to the Forces, Nevil Macready, in mid-February 1915 to discuss the future of his work. With the support of Macready the British Army formally recognised a Grave Registration Commission (GRC) on 2March that was created from Ware's unit. The Commission represented a joint effort between the British Army and the British Red Cross. Ware initially divided the Commission into four regions with six men and four vehicles each, led by a headquarters of forty-four workers. On 22 May he was made a temporary major in the British Army to provide his work added authority. On 9September the promotion was antedated to 22 February 1915.
The GRC's work continued to rapidly expand through 1915: by May 4,300 graves had been registered. That spring Ware began serving as an intermediary between the French and British governments over grave-related matters. The GRC was reorganised in summer 1915 into eight sections and began handling requests at a headquarters in Lillers. The sections worked on grave maintenance. By mid-August, 18,173 graves had been registered. Ware's role in the commission was to serve as "the sole intermediary between the British Army in the Field and the French Military and Civil Authorities in all matters relating to graves". He thus led negotiations between France and Britain beginning in March 1915, particularly with the French Grand Quartier Général, Ministry of War and Ministry of the Interior.
These negotiations attempted to resolve areas of disagreement between the two nations, particularly that of land expropriation for the cemeteries. The negotiations resulted in an "expropriation bill" which was presented to the Chamber of Deputies in July. Ware shepherded the bill through its passage, urging prominent British figures such as the adjutant-general and King George V to support it. By May 1916, the GRC had selected 200 sites for cemeteries. The law was passed by the French government on 29 December 1917 after objections in the senate were resolved. It gave Britain the ability to control their war graves in "perpetuity of sepulture" and provided for the establishment of a British authority to manage the cemeteries.
When Will Gladstone, a Member of Parliament and the grandson of former Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, was killed in action near Laventie on 13 April 1915, his family attempted to have the body exhumed and returned to England. Despite a ban on exhumations established by French General Joseph Joffre, his family received special permission to take the body and bury it in Hawarden, Wales. In response, with Ware's influence a ban on future exhumations was established. To facilitate ease of remembrance, Ware hoped burials would be in relatively centralised cemeteries and worked against isolated burials occurring.
On 10 September 1915 he was appointed a chevalier of the French Legion of Honour. The GRC had registered over 31,000 graves by October 1915 and 50,000 by May 1916. As the war continued, Ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post-war period. Following a suggestion by the British Army, the government created the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers' Graves in January 1916, with Edward, Prince of Wales agreeing to serve as president and Ware as a member. Ware was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel on 11 February 1916 as a result of his increasing responsibility over grave-related matters as the war expanded to more fronts.
Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries.
Ware competed with Sir Alfred Mond, the First Commissioner of Works, for responsibility over the graveyards. The Department of Works had managed war graves during previous British conflicts, and Mond wanted a share in managing graves from the First World War. Ware felt the scale of the war was so unprecedented a new organisation was needed to care for the graves and wanted to keep Mond out of the work. Though the feud continued into the 1930s, Ware's Commission was ensured priority when the GRC was formally integrated into the Army in May 1916 as the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries (DGRE).
Representatives from various relevant government departments were included and in September 1916 representatives from the dominions of the British Empire were included. Ware was made director of Graves Registration and Enquiries at the War Office on 15 May 1916, a post he held until the end of the war. That month he began working in London at Winchester House, St James's Square.
The move to London was in part because it was easier to develop photographs and women could work as clerks. It also became necessary as the DGRE expanded operations to areas outside France and Belgium. Only one-fifth of the typists Ware had requested initially arrived, but his staff eventually grew to around 700. The DGRE had expanded to include an Italian and an Eastern section; the latter included Salonika, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. Ware was soon given the nickname 'Lord Wargraves', reflecting his heavy involvement in grave-matters.
As Ware's work with graves continued, discussion about a "double identity disc" (previously there was only one per soldier) began in 1915 and continued into early 1916. Ware wrote Macready on 21 June 1915; in the letter he included a sketch of a pair of discs made of compressed fibreone could be removed and the other left with the corpse. On 24 June his proposal was accepted and four million were ordered. Discs began arriving in large numbers in mid-November. Such discs were issued to soldiers throughout the rest of the First World War and the Second World War despite the fibre decomposing quickly. The British Army stopped using the design in 1960.
While director, Ware was made a temporary brigadier-general on 12 August 1916. The DGRE regulated graves, making every aspect from spacing of graves to marking the graves uniform. He attempted to resolve differences between soldiers of different religious affiliations, decreeing for instance: "On no account should [Egyptian] Mohammedans be buried in Christian consecrated ground [...] Jewish graves were to be marked with a double triangle on a stake [and] under no circumstances should a cross be erected over an Indian Grave."
Efforts to neaten the cemeteries had begun in early 1916 when Ware invited Arthur William Hill, assistant director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to tour the cemeteries and advise upon further planting efforts. Hill visited 37 cemeteries and wrote a report on how to plant them. Efforts began slowly, but by 1917 the commission had established four nurseries. In the 1917 New Year Honours, Ware was made a companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG). By April 1917 the DGRE had registered over 156,500 graves; at least 150,000 in France and Belgium, 2,500 in Salonika and 4,000 in Egypt.
Imperial War Graves Commission.
By early 1917 several members of the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers' Graves believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves after the war. With the help of the Prince of Wales, Ware submitted a memorandum to the Imperial War Conference in 1917 suggesting that such an organisation be constituted. The suggestion was accepted and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission was established by royal charter, with the Prince of Wales serving as president and Secretary of State for War Lord Derby as chairman.
The IWGC had the responsibility for soldiers of members of the British Empire who died in active service. At its first meeting on 20 November, Ware was appointed vice-chairman. Historian Tim Skelton wrote that he was ""de facto", chief executive" of the commission. The IWGC could purchase land, build memorials, and restrict other memorials in the cemeteries.
In September 1917 Ware was given authority to wear the insignia of a commander of the Belgian Ordre de la Couronne. That month Belgium granted Britain land for cemeteries in perpetuity. Similar agreements were soon negotiated with Egypt, Italy, Serbia, and Greece. Once land for cemeteries and memorials had been guaranteed, the task of recording the details of the dead could fully begin. Around 587,000 graves had been identified and 559,000 soldiers listed as having no known grave by 1918. On 7October 1918 Ware was given the temporary rank of major-general as director-general of the DGRE.
Planning.
In May 1917 architect Edwin Lutyens wrote to Ware, urging "great stone[s] of fine proportion twelve feet long set fair or finely wrought". The proposal, supported by Ware, was criticised by figures such as Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for its lack of religious motifs. Ware told Lutyens he was "shocked" by the response and was considering giving the Office of Works responsibility for graves. He still felt "the 'stone' will win yet." Lutyens considered Ware "a most excellent fellow and very keen to do the right thing without fear or favour of the present sentiment. With a preference for the most permanent and perfect."
In June 1917 Ware proposed a £10 budget per grave (equivalent to £ in terms), which became the standard sum for the IWGC. On 9July a committee organised by Ware, consisting of the Director of the Tate, Charles Aitken, the author J. M. Barrie, and the architects Lutyens and Herbert Baker, toured the cemeteries in order to form a plan for the post-war activities of the commission. The committee met on 14 July and decided all cemeteries should have a general theme, though one had not yet been decided. They agreed there would be four variations on the theme: monumental, garden or woodland, village, and town cemeteries; and grave markers would be uniform, with no individual crosses or monuments. In August Lutyens suggested there be "one kind of monument throughout [the cemeteries], whether in Europe, Asia, or Africa". He suggested that his Great War Stones be used as the monument.
On 21 September Ware, Hill, Lutyens, and Baker met in London to discuss preliminary plans. No agreement was reached. Lutyens continued to promote his concept of war stones as respectful to all religions, but Aitken and Baker favoured crosses. Both sides attempted to gain Ware's endorsement for their view. Upon Ware's invitation, author Rudyard Kipling was appointed the commission's literary adviser in October 1917. In late 1917 Ware began searching for a replacement to Aitken, who did not fully support Ware's vision for the commission. He also looked into establishing a 'Religious Advisory Committee' to help settle religious questions.
As Aitken's replacement, Frederic G. Kenyon was made artistic director of the Commission on 20 November 1917, largely to serve as a mediator in frequent conflicts between the architects. As part of his job he began to write a report deciding which proposals would be instituted in the IWGC's cemeteries. On 22 November Ware formally announced that there would be no difference "between officers and men lying in the same cemeteries in the form or nature of the memorials". In 1918 Lutyens, Baker, and Reginald Blomfield were appointed the commission's principal architects.
In 1918 Kenyon finished his report, titled "War Graves: How the Cemeteries Abroad Will Be Designed," and presented it to the commission. The report outlined many factors of how the cemeteries would be designed, particularly emphasising equal treatment of all soldiers. It also supported the programme of planting under Arthur Hill. Kenyon proposed having young architects design the cemeteries under the supervision of more experienced and senior architects such as Baker and Lutyens. Kenyon accepted Lutyens' proposal and critics were appeased by support for a Cross of Sacrifice designed by Blomfield, and a recommendation that a cross be placed in every cemetery. The war stones became known as the Stones of Remembrance, and more than a thousand were erected. Kipling proposed the inscription "their name liveth for evermore" for the monuments.
For his work during the war, Ware was mentioned in despatches twice, including by Douglas Haig on 10 April 1919. The same year he was made a companion of the Order of the Bath, and in 1920 a knight commander of the Order of the British Empire. He received the Croix de Guerre and was made a commander of the Order of the Crown of Belgium. On 1 March 1921 Ware relinquished his commission, leaving the army, and was granted the rank of honorary major-general. In May 1922 he was made knight commander of the Royal Victorian Order. In 1929 the University of Aberdeen granted him an honorary doctorate.
Postwar.
Upon the end of the First World War, the IWGC could fully begin work. When the war ended, cemeteries were in disarray and many soldiers were still unburied. Though it technically was not responsible for burials and Ware's proposals for a 'burial corps' were rejected, in practice the commission was held responsible for making sure all bodies were buried. Ware continued to work for the commission, undertaking negotiations with foreign nations and hiring further professionals.
Building remembrance.
As people would soon begin visiting, the IWGC rushed to make the cemeteries presentable. The commission began building experimental cemeteries at Le Tréport, Forceville and Louvencourt in 1918. These were complete in early 1920 and were generally positively received, particularly the one at Forceville. Various changes were made based on the experimental cemeteries; notably cutting the cost of building cemeteries. The commission's work continued rapidly; by April 1920, there had been 128,577 re-interments in France and Belgium and the IWGC was managing 788 cemeteries. In March 1920 Ware predicted there would be more than half a million graves in 1,200 cemeteries in France and Belgium. Charles Holden was made a fourth principal architect that year.
Herbert Ellison managed most of the IWGC's business as Ware handled political issues. Ware was considered one of the faces of the commission, and gave annual Remembrance Day addresses to the United Kingdom to urge against future wars. He also had a film made, gave lectures, and organised photographic exhibits about the IWGC's work. At the Imperial War Conference in June 1918 it was agreed to make funding for the commission proportional to the number of soldiers each nation had lost based on figures submitted by Ware. The United Kingdom funded the vast majority of the commission's workaround 80%. His £10 figure had become standard reckoning, and in November 1918 the IWCG created a finance committee. In May and June 1919, Ware argued that the IWGC should be made independent of HM Treasury, which was observing the commission's finances, and this largely occurred after a meeting on 20 June.
Though many nations had given Britain control of their war graves and cemeteries in perpetuity, the Commission continued to seek similar concessions from other nations, including those who had fought against the United Kingdom during the war. One of the most difficult such areas was Gallipoli, which had been the site of the Gallipoli campaign. New Zealand and Australia, whose ANZAC forces had been heavily involved in the fighting, felt strongly that the IWGC should secure land for a cemetery. Charles Bean, the influential journalist and author of Australia's official war history proposed that "the complete Anzac site, including the Turkish trenches on the reverse slope adjoining it, be vested in the Graves Commission".
Ware had unsuccessfully attempted to begin negotiations with Turkey in 1917, separately asking the Red Cross, the Catholic Church, and the United States to serve as intermediaries. At the Paris Peace Conference from 1919 to 1920, the IWGC pushed for the right to land on Gallipoli called the 'ANZAC estate'as soon as possible. Ware was personally involved in these negotiations. The Commission gained such a concession in the Treaty of Sèvres, signed in August 1920. Renegotiation occurred after the Turkish War of Independence, and in the Treaty of Lausanne the IWGC gained the right to land the Allies considered "necessary for the establishment of cemeteries for the regrouping of graves, for ossuaries or memorials". By 1926, the IWGC had built 31 cemeteries and five memorials on the peninsula.
Ware travelled extensively after the war, visiting Canada (1925), Egypt (1929), India and Iraq (1930), and Australia and New Zealand (1934). The Commission faced criticism over not allowing individual memorials for soldiers, and repatriation of bodies of the dead, including in a petition spearheaded by Lady Florence Cecil (wife of William Cecil, the Bishop of Exeter) that was presented to the Prince of Wales in spring 1920 with over eight thousand signatures. Ware worked with William Burdett-Coutts, an MP, to write statements urging Parliament to allow the IWGC to continue its work. The disagreements led to a debate in Parliament over funding of the commission on 4May 1920. Sir James Remnant started the debate, followed by numerous speakers; notably speeches by Burdett-Coutts in favour of the commission's principles and Lord Robert Cecil (Lady Florence Cecil's brother-in-law) supporting those who wanted repatriation and opposed uniformity of grave markers.
Winston Churchill, the then Secretary of State for War, closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote. Remnant withdrew his motion, allowing the commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles. In 1921 the commission moved to offices at 82 Baker Street. Most cemeteries were completed by the mid-1920s, at a total cost of £8,150,000 (about £ million in terms), in what was, according to architectural historian Gavin Stamp, "one of the largest schemes of public works ever undertaken".
Monuments.
Following the end of the war, there was an influx of Commonwealth organisations that wanted to construct memorials in France and Belgium. Private divisional monuments and memorials for individual countries were quickly proposed and the National Battlefield Memorial Committee was set up in 1919 to oversee the construction of monuments for the United Kingdom. Ware and the IWGC had the ability to license all such memorials and he began working with the various groups.
Although Ware felt the primary focus of the IWGC should be cemeteries, by August 1921 it had gained responsibility for battlefield monuments as the National Battlefield Memorial Committee was dissolved. The Commission planned to build twelve monuments to missing soldiers in France and Belgium, and several others to sailors lost at sea and across Europe.
Discussions on how to commemorate the Ypres Salient, the first monument the IWGC worked on, dated back to 1919, when Winston Churchill said, "I should like us to acquire the whole of the ruins of Ypres as a memorial [...] A more sacred place for the British race does not exist in the world". The Belgian government agreed to give Britain the ruins of the Menin Gate to build a memorial for Commonwealth soldiers whose graves were unknown. Reginald Blomfield was appointed to design the monument. He proposed a triumphal arch and central hall. The IWGC struggled to navigate various commissions when building monuments in the United Kingdom.
During planning for the Mercantile Marine Memorial in London, the Royal Fine Arts Commission (RFAC) rejected Lutyens's initial proposal at Temple Gardens on the bank of the River Thames, suggesting Tower Hill instead. Upset, Lutyens and Ware unsuccessfully urged the RFAC to reconsider. To commemorate sailors lost at sea, the IWGC planned three naval memorials of the same design in Chatham, Portsmouth, and Plymouth. They were designed by Sir Robert Lorimer with Henry Poole as a sculptor. Though Ware worked closely with the Admiralty on the monuments, he disliked it, saying the idea of their involvement "fills me with dismay".
When the Menin Gate was completed in 1927, 57,000 names were inscribed on the monument. Ware worked to convince the Dominions to allow their soldiers' names to appear on the Menin Gate, as it was intended to be an imperial monument. They had plans for their own memorials, but eventually all (except New Zealand) allowed some names to be listed. Such vast monuments created some resentment among the French people, whose country could scarcely afford to build large memorials for their soldiers. In 1926, it was concluded that "the French authorities were disquieted by the number and scale of the Memorials which the Commission proposed to erect in France and that some modification of the proposals was necessary". Ware began working to prevent formal opposition to the monuments from manifesting. As a result, the IWGC's proposals were dropped to six monuments, four in France and two in Belgium.
In July 1926, Ware proposed an Anglo-French cemetery at Thiepval. In an effort to gain further French support for the Thiepval Memorial, he proposed placing the inscription (to the French and British armies, from the grateful British Empire) on the monument. In November, Ware and Lutyens met with the French architect Emmanuel Pontremoli and the French general Noël Édouard to discuss Thiepval. After two years of further discussions, approval for the project was granted by the on 12 April 1928, and construction soon began.
Ware attended numerous monument dedications: in 1924 all three naval monuments; in 1927 the Menin Gate, Tyne Cot, and Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial; in 1928 the Mercantile Marine Memorial, Nieuport Memorial, Soissons Memorial, and La Ferté-sous-Jouarre memorial; and in 1930 the Le Touret Memorial. In 1931 he spoke at the unveiling of the All India War Memorial in New Delhi. He was present at the unveiling of Theipval on 1 August 1932.
As more monuments approached completion, the commission began searching for ways to ensure it would have the financial capability to independently manage repairs. In June 1926 an endowment fund was created for the commission. The Treasury disliked the fund, but Ware considered it the commission's "only hope of permanency". After the fund was established, the Treasury continued to resist the commission's proposals and suggested suspending the United Kingdom's contributions to the fund for three years in 1931. Ware convinced the influential advisor to the Treasury George May to accept a reduced payment scheme. After the Treasury attempted to propose deferring payments again in August, Ware wrote angrily to Warren Fisher of the Treasury and helped Neville Chamberlain and Stanley Baldwin prepare opposition. Around a month later the Treasury tried again and Ware convinced the prime minister of Canada to tell their high commissioner to the United Kingdom to resist any proposed changes by the Treasury without consulting other Commonwealth nations. The endowment fund was secured by 1932.
As vice-chairman, Ware unsuccessfully attempted to ensure uniformity of monuments in keeping with his ideal of cooperation between Britain and the Dominions. One of the IWGC's last monuments was the Villers–Bretonneux Australian National Memorial, not dedicated until 1938. Though William Lucas had won a contest to design the memorial in 1925, Ware and General Talbot Hobbs disliked the design, and the project was halted by the Australian government of James Scullin in 1930. Hobbs then approached Lutyens about designing the memorial. Work did not resume on the project until Ware travelled to Australia in 1935 to push for action from the government. In the mid-1930s, the commission struggled financially as it increased salaries for its employees in the face of the Great Depression. Ware, fearing unwanted reform from a Treasury investigation, arranged for the appointment of an investigative committee. It published a report in July 1938 and the commission began cutting costs.
In 1936 Italy made Ugo Cei director of graves, going against their agreement with the British government which had led to grave affairs being managed by an Anglo-Italian Committee. Although Britain was sanctioning the Italian government, Ware travelled to Rome and was able to get the committee reconstituted. Similar committees also existed in Germany, France, Belgium, and other nations. Ware saw them as tools to further the IWGC's work to, as the historian Philip Longworth writes, "bring home to ordinary people of all nations a realisation of the cost of war."
A similar practice was adopted in Germany, where an Anglo-French-German committee was established based on a 20 November 1935 agreement. The committee was the first in a former enemy power and Ware saw its work as uniting the nations in "an organised movement of common remembrance of the dead of the Great War." He was convinced that by uniting nations through memorials, another war could be prevented. Longworth writes that Ware intended to use "the Commission as a sort of minor League of Nations to forward the work of international understanding."
Ware published an account of the work of the IWGC in 1937 titled "The Immortal Heritage". He was given the authority to wear the insignia of a commander of the Legion of Honour on 27 December 1933 and the insignia of a grand officer on 16 December 1938.
Other work.
In the 1930s Ware moved to Amberley, Gloucestershire. He served as a member of the Imperial Committee on Economic Consultation and Co-operation in 1932. In July 1932 he urged the Canadian prime minister R. B. Bennett to support an 'Imperial Economic Committee' outside the British Treasury's control. Ware was the first to seriously propose something of the kind, submitting a draft charter for the establishment of the 'Imperial Economic Commission', which would function as an economic general staff for the empire. The proposal gained little support.
Ware was an honorary associate at the Royal Institute of British Architects,"" and a director of the journal "Nineteenth Century and After". As a director of the journal, he made the decision to appoint Arnold Wilson as editor and later insisted on his removal for poor coverage of the Spanish Civil War. He was an adviser at the 1937 Imperial Conference. Ware also served the county of Gloucestershire in various capacities,"" including as president of the Gloucestershire Rural Community Council from 1940 to 1948, chairman of the executive committee of the Parents' National Educational Union in 1939, and chairman of the Gloucestershire Branch of the Council for the Preservation of Rural England.
Second World War and death.
Ware travelled to Cologne in October 1936 and attended a conference of the German War Graves Commission (). In his speech he said war cemeteries would promote "a blessed healing of wounds", but at the same time warned "armed conflict [...] between these great nations would result in deeper wounds, wounds so deep that they would defy healing." The speech was well received and republished by the German press.
Ware continued his efforts against war even as the "Anschluss" and the Munich Agreement occurred. He spoke at the "Volksbund"'s celebration in 1938, again advocating against war. In 1939 he spoke to Ivan Maisky, the Ambassador of the Soviet Union to the United Kingdom, and worked on negotiations between the USSR and IWGC. That year Ware began preparations for a possible war.
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Ware was recalled to serve as director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries at the War Office on 30 August 1939. On 3September he was granted an emergency commission with the honorary rank of major-general. He also continued in his role as vice-chairman of the commission and facilitated cooperation between the organisations.
In Autumn 1940 Ware began working on a programme to memorialise civilian dead as a result of the war. He wrote a letter to Winston Churchill, by then Prime Minister, saying the IWGC could not "omit to commemorate these [civilian casualties] if the higher purposes inspiring their work" were to continue to be respected, and the IWGC began recording civilian deaths "caused by enemy action" in January 1941. Despite support from the King and Registrar General, the Commission struggled to record all informationparticularly the addresses of next of kin.
After Ware toured some of the areas with the most deaths, local authorities were enlisted to help. By releasing various announcements and a radio broadcast by Ware in November, the IWGC had collected information on more than 18,000 people. In January 1942 he proposed listing dead civilians in the Warrior's Chapel in Westminster Abbey on a roll of honour. Though the Dean of Westminster supported the proposal, Herbert Morrison, the minister of home security, argued such a list should be put up after the war. Following discussions, it was agreed the rolls would not be announced until after the war ended.
Ware resigned as director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries in 1944, leaving the army, to continue his work with the commission. Progress was hampered as the DGRE and IWGC struggled to cooperate. In April 1944 Ware spoke at a conference on war memorials organised by the Royal Society of Arts. He toured cemeteries in France and Belgium in August 1945. He resigned as vice-chairman of the Commission in 1948 due to old age and failing health, particularly his chronic phlebitis.
Ware died on 28 April 1949 in Barnwood House Hospital, Gloucester, and was buried in Holy Trinity Churchyard, Amberley on 2May. His grave has an IWGC-style headstone. There are memorial tablets to him in St George's Chapel at Westminster Abbey and in Gloucester Cathedral. The road Boulevard Fabian Ware in Bayeux, the location of Bayeux War Cemetery, is named in his honour.

Subsea 7

Subsea 7 S.A. (stylised as Subsea7) is a Luxembourgish multinational services company involved in subsea engineering and construction serving the offshore energy industry. The company is registered in Luxembourg with its headquarters in London. Subsea 7 delivers offshore projects and provides services for the energy industry.
Subsea7 makes offshore energy transition feasible through working on lower-carbon oil and gas and by providing services for the growth of renewables and other emerging energy industries.
History.
The company was formed by the January 2011 merger of two predecessor companies, Acergy S.A. and Subsea 7, Inc.
Acergy was founded in 1970 as Stolt Nielsen Seaway, a division of the Norwegian Stolt-Nielsen Group offering divers for the exploration of the North Sea. After a series of acquisitions, including Comex Services of France in 1992 and Houston, Texas–based Ceanic Corporation in 1998, the company changed its name to Stolt Offshore in 2000. Five years later Stolt-Nielsen spun out the company as an independent business listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The firm renamed as Acergy in March 2006.
Subsea 7, Inc. was the result of a series of mergers between DSND Offshore AS, Halliburton Subsea, Subsea Offshore and Rockwater over an extended period, with Rockwater and SubSea merging in 1999 to form Halliburton Subsea, and the resulting company operating as a 50/50 joint venture with DSND in 2002 with the name Subsea 7. Halliburton exited the joint venture in November 2004. The company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in August 2005 following its restructuring the same year.
On 21 June 2010 the combination of Acergy S.A. and Subsea 7 Inc. was announced and was completed on 7 January 2011. The new entity took the Subsea 7 name while retaining Acergy's Luxembourg domicile and operational headquarters in London. The chairman and chief executive roles were filled by Kristian Siem and Jean Cahuzac, who had previously held the same roles at Subsea 7 and Acergy respectively.
On 24 July 2025 the signing of Subsea7 and Saipem merger agreement was announced. The new entity will take the name Saipem7. Saipem7 will remain incorporated in Italy and headquartered in Milan, and will have its shares listed on both the Milan and Oslo stock exchanges.

Radioactive scrap metal

Radioactive scrap metal is created when radioactive material enters the metal recycling process and contaminates scrap metal.
Overview.
A "lost source accident" occurs when a radioactive object is lost or stolen. Such objects may appear in the scrap metal industry if radioactive sources are lost or improperly stored or disposed of, leading to people mistaking them for harmless bits of metal. The International Atomic Energy Agency has provided guides for scrap metal collectors on what a sealed source might look like. The best known example of this type of event is the Goiânia accident, in Brazil.
While some lost-source accidents have not involved the scrap metal industry, they are good examples of the likely scale and scope of a lost-source accident. For example, the Red Army left sources behind in Didi Lilo, Georgia.
Another case occurred at Yanango where an 192Ir radiography source was lost and at Gilan, Iran a radiography source harmed a welder.
Radioactive sources have a wide range of uses in medicine and industry, and it is common for the design (and nature) of a source to be tailored to the specific application. Hence, it is impossible to state with confidence what the "typical" source looks like or contains. For instance, antistatic devices include beta and alpha emitters: polonium containing devices have been used to eliminate static electricity in such devices as paint spraying equipment. An overview of the gamma sources used for radiography can be seen at Radiographic equipment, and it is reasonable to consider this to be a good overview of small to moderate gamma sources.
Physical and chemical compositions.
The cleanup operation for the Goiânia accident was difficult both because the source containment had been opened, and the radioactive material was water-soluble.
In 1983, a different incident in Mexico wherein cobalt-60 was spilled in an otherwise similar exposure led to a very different pattern of contamination, since the cobalt in such a source is normally in the form of cobalt metal alloyed with some nickel to improve the mechanical properties of the radioactive metal. If such a source is abused, then the cobalt metal fragments do not tend to dissolve in water or become very mobile. If a cobalt or iridium source is lost at a ferrous metal scrapyard then it is often the case that the source will enter a furnace, the radioactive metal will melt and contaminate the steel from this furnace. In Mexico, some buildings have been demolished because of the level of cobalt-60 in the steel used to make them. Also, some of the steel which was rendered radioactive in the Mexican event was used to make legs for 1400 tables.
Source melting.
In the case of some high-value scrap metals it is possible to decontaminate the material, but this is best done long before the metal goes to a scrap yard.
Ferrous scrap.
In the case of a caesium source being melted in an electric arc furnace used for steel scrap, it is more likely that the caesium will contaminate the fly ash or dust from the furnace, while radium is likely to stay in the ash or slag. The United States Environmental Protection Agency provides data about the fate of different contaminating elements in a scrap furnace. Four different fates for the element exist: the element can stay in the metal (as with cobalt and ruthenium); the element can enter the slag (as in lanthanides, actinides and radium); the element can enter the furnace dust or fly ash (as with caesium), which accounts for around 5%; or the element can leave the furnace and pass through the baghouse to enter the air (as with iodine).
Aluminium scrap.
It is normal to place silicon, aluminium scrap and flux in a furnace. This is heated to form molten aluminium. From the furnace three main streams are obtained, metal product, dross (metal oxides and halides which are skimmed off the molten metal product) and off gases which go to the baghouse. The cooled waste gasses are then allowed out into the environment.
Copper scrap.
It is normal that good-quality scrap copper, such as that from a nuclear plant, is refined in one furnace before being refined further in an electrochemical process. The furnace generates impure metal, slag, dust and gases. The dust accumulates in a baghouse, while the gases are vented to the atmosphere. The impure metal from the furnace may be further refined in an electrochemical process.
If the copper refinery includes an electrochemical process after the furnace, then unwanted elements are removed from the impure metal and deposited as anode slime.

Ilvala and Vatapi

Ilvala () and Vatapi () are asura brothers in Hindu mythology. They are featured in the Mahabharata, in which their murderous scheme is ended by the sage Agastya.
Legend.
In the Mahabharata, the sage Lomasha narrates the legend of the daityas called Ilvala and Vatapi to the prince Yudhishthira. The elder of the brothers, Ilvala, is stated to have once begged a Brahmin hermit to grant him a son equal to that of the deity Indra. When the Brahmin refused this request, Ilvala grew angry with him. He turned Vatapi into a lamb or a goat, cooked his meat, and served him to the Brahmin. After the Brahmin had completed his meal, Ilvala called out to his brother by name, who promptly emerged from within the Brahmin's side, murdering him. Ilvala performed this deed on multiple occasions with the Brahmins he encountered. The brothers engaged in the same scheme when they came across the sage Agastya. When Ilvala summoned Vatapi after being swallowed by the sage, the latter informed him that his brother had been digested by him. When the terrified asura asked Agastya how he could serve him, Agastya asked for ten thousand cows and pieces of gold, and a golden chariot yoked by two steeds. 
In the Ramayana, Ilvala is stated to have attacked Agastya after his brother's death, after which he was also slain by the sage's glance.
The Bhagavata Purana mentions that Ilvala had a son named Balavala, who used to disturb the sages present at Naimisha forest as they listened to the narration of various Puranas from Ugrashravas. He is slain by the deity Balarama during his pilgrimage.

Like Minds

Like Minds is a 2006 Australian unreliable narrative psychological thriller film written and directed by Gregory J. Read. The film was produced by the South Australian Film Corporation. It debuted in Australia on 9 November 2006. The psychological thriller is the first Australian/UK co-production to be set in the UK in over a decade. "Like Minds" was retitled "Murderous Intent" for its 2007 U.S. DVD release, and stars Toni Collette, Tom Sturridge, Richard Roxburgh, Kate Maberly, and Eddie Redmayne, in his film debut.
Plot.
The film opens with seventeen-year-old Alex Forbes, a privileged and intelligent student, engaging in thrill-seeking behavior with his friends. After the sudden death of his roommate, Nigel Colbie, Alex is arrested and charged with murder. Forensic psychologist Sally Rowe is assigned to evaluate him. Through flashbacks, Alex recounts his time with Nigel at boarding school, revealing a deeply unsettling relationship shaped by manipulation, obsession, and dark philosophical beliefs.
Nigel, introduced as a reclusive student with a fascination for death and taxidermy, gradually infiltrates Alex’s life. Their dynamic becomes increasingly toxic after the suspicious death of their mutual friend Josh, which Alex believes Nigel orchestrated. Nigel’s influence deepens when he assists Alex with an essay and later introduces him to a secret society known as the Brotherhood — a modern offshoot of the Knights Templar. Nigel claims both he and Alex are destined for a sacred role within it. Their connection is symbolized by a playing card, the Jack of Spades, which on the back is inscribed ""MY BELOVED MARACLEA"." Nigel presents this to Alex as a marker of his identity and fate.
Following a failed romantic connection between Alex and a local girl named Susan, she is found murdered in a ritualistic manner. Her body is discovered surgically dissected and displayed in a grotesque position. Evidence surrounding her death, and Nigel’s increasing fanaticism, begins to unravel the sinister underpinnings of the Brotherhood. Nigel shares a Templar legend involving necrophilia and a woman named Maraclea, whose grave was desecrated as part of a power ritual. Nigel later attempts to coerce Alex into completing a similar ritual with Susan’s corpse, insisting that as her only love, Alex must perform the act to fulfill their shared destiny.
Alex appears to refuse — disturbed, grieving, and overwhelmed. However, later implications suggest he went through with it. Nigel taunts him about the event, claiming he "could smell [him] on her," and Alex’s increasing denial becomes less convincing. Although he protests in horror, Nigel declares it “doesn’t matter now” because Alex can still have his Maraclea.
As tensions escalate, Alex receives a letter from Nigel inviting him to the Colbie estate. There, Alex discovers a scene of horror involving Nigel's parents: Nigel’s mother is accidentally shot by his father during a confrontation, and the father is later killed by a gunshot meant for Nigel. Nigel, eerily calm, continues with the ritual, burning the organs and declaring their “union” inevitable. When Alex is disgusted by Nigel for committing incest and necrophilia with his mother, Nigel reiterates that Alex participated, accusing him again of violating Susan’s body. Though Alex denies it, the mounting evidence — his behavior, the imagery, and his silence — suggests otherwise.
Alex flees into the night, with Nigel pursuing him to a nearby railway. As an oncoming train approaches, Alex steps onto the tracks, daring Nigel to shoot him. Instead, Nigel pleads with him to move, insisting their fate has already been written. At the last moment, Nigel tackles Alex out of the way. Disarmed, Nigel falls to the floor and Alex takes the gun. Declaring that they are “one now,” Nigel reaches up and pulls the trigger, killing himself.
In the aftermath, Alex is seen pasting clippings into the Brotherhood’s red journal and carefully packs it into a bag, along with Nigel’s doctor’s case and a small, square box — heavily implied to contain Susan’s skull. 
Meanwhile, Rowe delivers a lecture at the Ninth Annual Conference of Forensic Psychology, discussing the convergence of belief, delusion, and identity — “a merging of like minds.” Later, she finds a sealed envelope on her car bearing the Brotherhood’s insignia. Inside is a Jack of Spades inscribed with “"MY BELOVED SUSAN".” Shortly after, she is called to the cemetery: Susan’s grave has been desecrated, her skeleton rearranged with crossed thigh bones, and the skull missing.
The film concludes with a flashback to Alex in interrogation, stating, “Nigel got what he wanted.” When Rowe asks what that was, he replies, “Eternity.” On a train, Alex sits behind a boy reading a history book. Still carrying the box, he leans forward and asks, “You like history?”
Production.
The film was shot on location in Yorkshire, England, and South Australia, reflecting its status as an Australian–British co-production. Scenes in the hall were filmed in Bradford Grammar School, Bradford, while the school chapel scenes were filmed both outside and inside the historic chapel of Giggleswick School, near Settle, in North Yorkshire, lending an authentic Gothic atmosphere to the film’s religious and psychological themes. Some external shots, including those of the surrounding estate, were taken on the Carlton Towers Estate, a Victorian stately home used to reinforce the film’s tone of inherited legacy and aristocratic decay. The train scenes, which feature prominently in flashbacks and transitions, were filmed on a stationary New South Wales U Set Single Deck Interurban Car TF6011, now owned by Richmond Vale Railway Museum in New South Wales.
Box office.
"Like Minds" grossed $34,840 at the box office in Australia. The film had limited theatrical release but developed a cult following after its DVD release under the title "Murderous Intent".

The London Game

The London Game is a British board game based on the London Underground in London, England.
The game was first released in 1972 by the game company Condor. The game was re-released in 1997 to celebrate 25 years of the game's existence with a new all-colour board, with new cards.
The game.
The aim of the game is to start at one of five major stations (Paddington, Liverpool Street, King's Cross St Pancras, Victoria and Waterloo) before working your way around six other random stations in the central area, then returning to the terminal that you started from. However, the player has to navigate around certain things such as station blockages and hazard cards, as well as the mind of the other player.
Each player at the start gets dealt their six "souvenir cards". These cards consist of all of the main stations on the central tube, reaching as far out as Wembley, Arsenal and Oval.
Once the player has their cards, they can add two station blocks (closed station counters) on any station - except the main red ones. The players use small purple or blue counters to indicate this.
Once the player has done that, and chosen their main station to commence the game, it begins. There is a certain amount of strategy involved, as well as luck.
Players must move around the map to get along to their stations, so for example, if a player were at Lancaster Gate Underground station, and they rolled a two on the die, they could go to Notting Hill Gate in the west or Bond Street in the East.
Each time a player has to change lines (an inevitable outcome, considering the diversity geographically of the stations involved) they must pick up a "hazard card". There are roughly twenty types of hazard card, which say things like "You feel lonely. Join another player on the board" or "Forgot to buy gifts. Proceed to Oxford Circus at once to visit Hamleys". There are also other cards where you can send opponents wherever one may wish. Once you have carried out the card's instruction, you may proceed along the new line.
One of the main aims is to outfox the opponent. There are a large number of "Open/Close station" hazard cards, which allow the player to open one station and close another. By doing this, it is possible to block some players from moving, for example if they are located south of the river on the District line, by blocking off Ear'ls Court. Stations can be unblocked by rolling a six when within reach of a blocked station.
Booklet.
The accompanying booklet contains details on how to play the game, a list of every station in the central area, including which train lines that they are on, and factual information on the history of the underground.

Rinchen Barsbold

Rinchen Barsbold (, Rinchyengiin Barsbold, born December 21, 1935, in Ulaanbaatar) is a Mongolian paleontologist and geologist. He works with the Institute of Geology, at Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. He is an expert in vertebrate paleontology and Mesozoic stratigraphy.
Barsbold has been instrumental in the discovery and recovery of one of the largest dinosaur collections in the world. His work has helped to form a more modern understanding of the later stages of dinosaur evolution in Eurasia.
Barsbold has had considerable influence on dinosaur paleontology in the Communist world. His scientific work has made him a leading authority on theropods of the Gobi Desert, starting with his doctoral dissertation on these dinosaurs. As early as 1983, he noted that in different lineages of theropods, many features previously only known from birds had evolved in various combinations (Barsbold 1983). He postulated that as a result of this "ornithization", one or several lineages of theropods that happened to acquire the proper combination of such traits went on to evolve into actual birds.
Since the identification of a number of feathered dinosaurs beginning in the late 1990s, Barsbold's ideas have been more fully appreciated. When he initially published his conclusions—a list of generally rather obscure anatomical features—in 1983, there was little exchange between the Mongolian scientific community and that of Western countries. Moreover, his early papers were usually published in Russian, in which few Western scientists are fluent. In addition, Evgeny Kurochkin—a leading specialist on bird paleontology in the Soviet sphere—was critical of the theropod–bird link, working with and teaching mostly Cenozoic bird paleontology. Therefore, Barsbold's theories initially had more impact among paleontologists in Mongolia, the USSR, and allied countries.
He is the son of scientist and writer Byambyn Rinchen.
Dinosaur identification.
"Barsboldia" (Maryańska and Osmólska, 1981) is named after him.
The dinosaur genera and families named by Barsbold are, in alphabetical order:

A1 Grand Prix car

The Lola A1GP was a vehicle designed to compete in the A1 Grand Prix. The car was standardised for every team to provide a level playing field for competing nations. It was designed to reduce the volume of "dirty air", allowing drivers to close in on the car in front, encouraging overtaking. The bodywork was mainly pre-impregnated carbon fibre composites. From 2008–09 Ferrari was consulted on the design and manufacture for all A1 Grand Prix cars. From the 2008-2009 season the Lola A1GP car was replaced by the A1GP Powered by Ferrari car.
Design.
The Lola A1GP was the spec car used by the series from the 2005–06 season to the 2007–08 season. It was powered by Zytek engines, and ran on Cooper tyres. The former chassis was then used in the Euroseries 3000 (or Auto GP) started in 2009.
Chassis.
The chassis, designated Lola A1GP is made and designed by Lola Cars. The A1 Car's carbon fibre skin cloaks a core of aluminium honeycomb. Based on bionic engineering principles found in nature, the hexagonal honeycomb provides remarkable strength for its weight, and has progressive deformation properties in response to an impact, which contributes to driver safety. In addition, drivers are protected by FIA-approved side intrusion panels that protect them from lateral impacts.
Engine.
The engine for the cars was developed by Zytek Engineering. The 3.4-litre V8 unit is capable of delivering 520 bhp (550 bhp in PowerBoost mode). Each engine must be very durable, as it must last a whole season. The engine only weighs 120 kilograms, making it one of the lightest 3.4-litre engines ever made.
Technical specifications.
The car has an overall length of 4833 mm, with a long wheelbase of 3000 mm and a wide track of 1476 mm (front) and 1468 mm (rear). Its total weight amounts to 615 kilograms, without the driver and the fuel.
Suspension.
The front and rear suspension is of a double wishbone and pushrod operated twin coil over damper construction. Adjustable ride height, cambers and toe, as well as anti-dive and anti-squat made to optimise drive control.
Clutch.
A two-piece carbon clutch was tailored especially for the car to handle and the two racing starts per weekend. The unit combines lightweight construction with durability and reliability. The A1 car's gearchange is by an electronically controlled paddle-shifting via a six-speed paddle-shift semi-automatic sequential transmission
PowerBoost.
The PowerBoost button on the A1 car allows the engine to reach its maximum of . When used at the right time, this feature can encourage overtaking. For the PowerBoost to activate, the throttle position must be above 80% and the speed more than 60 km/h. The button must also be depressed to continue on PowerBoost mode. However, the PowerBoost automatically deactivates itself if the throttle falls below 40%. Each driver only has a limited number of uses of the PowerBoost function. The driver can only use it four times in a sprint race and eight times in a feature race. Once these maximum allocated uses of the PowerBoost have been used, the system is disabled until the end of the race, after which Zytek engineers reset the system for the next race.
Tyres.
A1 Grand Prix uses slick tyres on normal dry races. Pneumatics were supplied exclusively by Cooper Tires.
Fuel.
A1 Grand Prix uses 100 RON unleaded in 2005-2008 later E30 Biofuel and 70% unleaded gasoline in 2008-2009 for all cars.

Adrian Guelke

Adrian Guelke (born 15 June 1947) is Professor of Comparative Politics in the School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy at Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. He was previously Jan Smuts Professor of International Relations at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg from 1993 to 1995. After attending Diocesan College, Rondebosch, Cape Town, he studied for his BA and MA at the University of Cape Town where he also participated in the sit-in during the Mafeje affair in 1968. He earned his PhD at the London School of Economics. His thesis, dated 1994, was titled ""The age of terrorism" and the international political system, 1967-1992". He specialises in the comparative study of ethnic conflict, particularly the cases of Northern Ireland, his native South Africa and Kashmir. He is chair of the International Political Science Association's research committee on politics and ethnicity. And, as of 2013, Editor of the Academic Journal Nationalism and Ethnic Politics.
In 1991 he survived an assassination attempt at his Belfast home. Leon Flores, a member of the South African Defence Forces' intelligence branch, doctored a police report that described an academic at Queen's who was known to be involved in the IRA, substituting Guelke's name into the report. Flores then contacted the Ulster Defence Association, who attempted to shoot Guelke. He was saved because the gun used by the would-be assassin jammed. Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack report that "The UDA now acknowledges that it was being used by the South African authorities to take out a political enemy, and that Dr Guelke was innocent of the charge of aiding the IRA". The case features in Paul Larkin's book "A Very British Jihad: Collusion, Conspiracy and Cover-Up in Northern Ireland". Guelke is critical of the book, arguing in a review of it that his shooting "hardly demonstrates the intimate level of collusion that [Larkin] wishes to suggest existed among the loyalists, elements of the security forces and the apartheid regime". For his part, Larkin has argued with both Guelke and other critics of his book, all of whom were generally supportive of the security forces in the North of Ireland, that the highly infiltrated UDA was more than happy to collaborate over a number of decades with the covert wing of the apartheid regime and that this indisputable fact obviously lends support to Larkin's theory of collusion, precisely because the UDA was so infiltrated. The chief conspirator against Guelke - the above named Leon Flores - was a guest in the North of Ireland of both the UDA and the UVF - a visit initially facilitated by the covert security forces as his BBC Northern Ireland 'Spotlight' film demonstrated. The fact that the UDA might state that it was manipulated is therefore simply that - a statement of the fact. This terror organisation was quite happy to provide assistance to the apartheid regime, regardless of any subsequent platitudes they might utter. Larkin places no credence to Special Branch briefings on this issue for what he feels are obvious reasons.

William Colton

William Colton (born March 6, 1946) is an American politician who represents District 47 in the New York State Assembly, which comprises Bath Beach, Bensonhurst, Gravesend, Dyker Heights, and Midwood.
First elected to the Assembly in 1996, Colton currently serves as Majority Whip. He sits on the Correction, Environmental Conservation, Governmental Employees, Labor, Rules, and Ways and Means committees and is a member of the Asian Pacific American Task Force. He has previously served as chair and Vice Chair of the Majority Conference and as Chair of the Legislative Commission on Solid Waste Management.
According to his self-published biography, Colton is a lifelong resident of the district. Prior to entering the Assembly, Colton worked as a teacher within the New York City public school system, serving as a UFT Chapter Chairperson for six of his eleven years in that occupation, and as a licensed attorney since 1979. Colton is the co-founder and organizer of the Bensonhurst Tenants Council, founder of the Bensonhurst Straphangers Committee, and served as an attorney in the lawsuit that successfully prevented the re-opening of the Southwest Brooklyn Incinerator.
He holds a B.A. in degree in Urban Education from St. John's University, an M.S. in Urban Education from Brooklyn College and a J.D. from St. John's School of Law.
Legislation.
In the 2019-2020 and the 2021-2022 legislative terms, Colton was the primary sponsor of legislation to make the National Day of the People's Republic of China a public holiday in New York State. In the 2021–2022 term, one bill that Colton was the lead sponsor of was enacted, A03964, which increased fines for leaving the scene of an accident without reporting it.
Controversy.
Colton received criticism for a Facebook post he posted on August 9, 2020, calling Black Lives Matter a hate group, comparing it to the Ku Klux Klan. Colton later clarified that he did not think Black Lives Matter was a hate group, but that there were some bad actors within the movement who seek to spread hate, which he said was similar to how the Ku Klux Klan was started by "well intentioned" people until they later turned towards hate. The Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic, and Asian Legislative Caucus of New York released a statement saying they were "shocked and offended" by Colton's post.
Elections.
Colton has won 14 terms since 1996 and has never been primaried. His closest election occurred in 2022, when he beat Republican Dmitriy Kugel with 54.73% to Kugel's 45.15%.

I Loved Tiberius

Jeg elsket Tiberius is a 1959 romance novel by Elisabeth Dored. It was first translated into English by Naomi Walford in Great Britain by Methuen and United States by Pantheon Books in 1963 under the name I Loved Tiberius. The novel was written as a careful reappraisal of the contemporary sources, placing Julia and Tiberius in a more positive light. The novel is set in 1st century BC Rome, centred on Julia the Elder, the daughter of Augustus and her life right up until her death. The novel begins with Julia's birth and her mother being forbidden to see her. The plot is mainly focused on Julia's love life, notably her relationship with her stepbrother, Tiberius.
Plot.
The story begins in Rome. Julia, the daughter of Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, suffers with an awkward relationship between her and her sixteen-year-old stepbrother Tiberius. He is frequently unfair to her leading to them often fighting and them being punished. Through the harshness of living in Livia's strict household Tiberius becomes attracted to Julia's more affectionate nature despite her being merely thirteen. Very quickly Julia becomes smitten with him and he obsessed with her.
Tiberius decides that he wishes to marry Julia and plans to ask Augustus. However, before he has a chance, Augustus announces that Julia will be married to Marcellus as soon as she turns fourteen. Marcellus, who is in love with a consul's daughter, confides the truth to Julia. She gives him her blessing to go on seeing this girl but the affair ends after she becomes pregnant and her father marries her to a friend. Meanwhile, Julia discovers Tiberius is conducting affairs with other women. Julia and Marcellus comfort each other and finally consummate their marriage. Nonetheless, Julia finds Marcellus repugnant.
Marcellus becomes jealous of Agrippa when Augustus nearly dies from an illness and names Agrippa his heir by giving him his signant ring. Shortly after Augustus recovers Agrippa and Marcella (His wife and Julia's cousin) nearly die in a fire at their house that was purposely lit. Agrippa confides to Julia that he suspects Livia might be involved. He subsequently decides to leave Rome and travel to Lesbos.
Marcellus dies from the illness that nearly killed Augustus and Julia. Worried about her future Julia writes a letter to Agrippa (via Maecenas) begging him to return home. Meanwhile, Tiberius approaches Julia in the hope that he might finally have her for himself. However Augustus decides to marry her to Agrippa. Julia marries to Agrippa; and Tiberius to Agrippa's daughter Vipsania. The depression over not being able to marry Julia for a second time drives Tiberius to drink until he his confronted with it by Julia and Agrippa. He stops for the sake of his marriage to Vipsania.
Agrippa is deeply in love with Julia and has been since her marriage to Marcellus and to try and win favour with her he spoils her. However he is aware that she was in love with Tiberius and he with her. After a party where Tiberius attempts to seduce Julia, he begins to worry that the two will use Vipsania and himself as an excuse to see each other. Nonetheless, Julia chooses to go with Agrippa, rather than stay in Rome with Tiberius and Vipsania, when he leaves for a campaign in Gaul. Julia later discovers that Vipsania is in love with someone else, Gellus. She attempts to break them apart only to be blocked by Agrippa who says that she is only doing it to spite Vipsania.
After this, Julia decides to distance herself from Tiberius as much as possible by travelling with Agrippa around the empire. Along the way, the pair discover that Livia has many spies, and Julia advises Agrippa to reduce the influence of these spies to ensure that, in the event of Augustus falling ill and dying, they won't be run out by Livia's followers. The most notable is Salome, Herod the Great's sister. Agrippa and Julia advice Herod to reinstate his first wife Doris to reduce Salome's influence.
Livia realises this and attempts to get rid of Julia and her two sons by drowning them in a set-accident. However they are saved by Agrippa. Not long after this, Agrippa dies, and Julia's close ally and friend Maecenas, suggests that Livia had him poisoned. Julia becomes very depressed following Agrippa's death but tries to stay strong to ensure that her unborn child will be healthy. She gives birth to a little boy who is born feet first, like Agrippa was, and names him Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa Postumus in honour of his father.
Eventurally Julia and Tiberius marry and are happy until the death of their son, Nero. After the death Tiberius becomes paranoid that Julia will betray him. Following the death of his brother Drusus he begins to take out his sorrow and anger on her as well as taking to drink again. He begins treating her badly, on one occasion twisting her arm so hard he dislocates it. When Augustus asks about it Julia tries to lie but he quickly realises Tiberius is abusing her. Augustus is disgusted with this and Tiberius leaves. He leaves telling Julia that it is probably best for keeping both Augustus and Livia off his back.
The absence of Tiberius allows Julia to focus on her children and friends. She raises Agrippina and Postumus, as her elder children live with her father. She also raises Tiberius' only son Drusus. She also becomes fond of her cousin Antonia's son Claudius, who Postumus forges a friendship with due to their rejection by most other people.
Julia begins a close friendship with her cousin Julus, Mark Antony's son. He proves to be a good protector to her sons as well as someone to talk to. However he quickly confesses he wants them to be lover; she rejects him at first but eventually gives in although Julia disbelieves that Julus has love in his nature. However her father's servant (and Livia's spy) Crispus, who was at one time considered as a "safe" husband choice for Julia, suspects something. Julia is eventually arrested for trumped up charges of treason and is exiled. Her mother Scribonia chooses to go with her. She manages to sneak a letter from her children, written by Gaius, promising that once Augustus was dead they would bring both her and Scribonia back to Rome and charge Livia with the murder of their father, Agrippa.
However all her children meet tragic fates: her son Lucius is poisoned and Gaius murdered on a campaign; her daughter Julilla is also exiled on trumped up charges of adultery; and her youngest son Postumus exiled. Julia learns from Agrippina that Postumus had become depressed and violent as a result of losing his mother and he was exiled for hitting Livia after she confesses to having his mother exiled and his brothers murdered. While in exile Postumus comes to see the error of his ways and is allowed to write a letter to his mother, telling her that he is studying well and working to make her proud.
Meanwhile, in Rome Augustus forgives Postumus when he realises, with the help of Agrippina, what Livia has been doing and tries to call him back. After seeing the change in Postumus' character he decides that he will change his will to make him his heir, rather than Tiberius. However Augustus becomes ill and dies before he is able to call Postumus back. Realising that he might die before Postumus is saved Augustus plans to have Postumus secretly removed from exile and replaced by his slave Clitus. To ensure that the plots to make Postumus emperor and restore Julia to favour come to nothing, Livia has Postumus secretly murdered.
After hearing of the death of her last son Julia decides to kill herself. She confides to her mother that she intends to write down her story before she dies so that it can be passed on to her one surviving child, Agrippina. Before she dies, she realises that Tiberius has become corrupted by power like her father had and that it was Agrippa, not Tiberius, whom she truly loved; and that Agrippa and Scribonia are the only people that truly loved her.
Context.
A majority of the story is based on a series of love-triangles between Julia, Tiberius and Agrippa. There are various other triangles including Julia, Tiberius and Iullus.

Four Eyed Monsters

Four Eyed Monsters, an American 2005 film by Susan Buice and Arin Crumley. It roughly follows Buice and Crumley's real life relationship; the couple initially communicated only through artistic means inspired to continue their online digital non-verbal courtship in the analog world. The film is a very low-budget digital video production but has gained attention for its use of various web-related strategies in distribution and in its ability to build an audience through the use of online resources, a growing trend among contemporary American indie filmmakers. In 2007 it became the first ever feature film to be released on YouTube. In 2010 the film was released on VODO where it was placed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike license allowing audience members to redistribute or even alter it as they wish. Since then a number of screenings have been utilized taking advantage of this open license.
The film was shot on MiniDV using the Panasonic AG-DVX100 mostly in Brooklyn and Manhattan, New York, with supplementary shooting in Framingham, Massachusetts and Johnson, Vermont. It was edited on Apple's Final Cut Pro editing software. It debuted on the festival circuit in January 2005 at the Slamdance Film Festival where it was well received.
At first the filmmakers hoped to obtain a conventional deal for theatrical distribution on the basis of its success at Slamdance, but nothing was forthcoming. This is when they decided to release what eventually grew into a two-season 13 episode online series about the journey of creating the film. This attention eventually grabbed the attention of IFC TV who went on to air the film, release in iTunes and sell DVDs through Borders bookstore. IFC then stopped selling the film and for a period of time it was only available in Canada through Films We Like and UK via DOG WOOF. IN 2009 the film was relaunched on YouTube and in 2010 released on VODO.
Plot.
A shy videographer (Arin) and an uninspired artist working as a waitress (Susan) meet on the Internet and spark a relationship. Fed up with the usual dating game, the two decide to not communicate verbally, only through artistic means to see if they can make it work.
Video podcast.
Out of their creation of the film, the Four Eyed Monsters podcast was born. It played on various places on the web, and episodes 9-13 debuted on IFC as a featured web series. Episode 3.5 featured a cameo by Chicago filmmaker Mike Krumlauf.

Brocard points

In geometry, Brocard points are special points within a triangle. They are named after Henri Brocard (1845–1922), a French mathematician.
Definition.
In a triangle with sides , where the vertices are labeled in counterclockwise order, there is exactly one point such that the line segments form the same angle, , with the respective sides , namely that
formula_1
Point is called the first Brocard point of the triangle , and the angle is called the Brocard angle of the triangle. This angle has the property that
formula_2
There is also a second Brocard point, , in triangle such that line segments form equal angles with sides respectively. In other words, the equations
formula_3
apply. Remarkably, this second Brocard point has the same Brocard angle as the first Brocard point. In other words, angle
formula_4
is the same as
formula_5
The two Brocard points are closely related to one another; in fact, the difference between the first and the second depends on the order in which the angles of triangle are taken. So for example, the first Brocard point of is the same as the second Brocard point of .
The two Brocard points of a triangle are isogonal conjugates of each other.
Construction.
The most elegant construction of the Brocard points goes as follows. In the following example the first Brocard point is presented, but the construction for the second Brocard point is very similar.
As in the diagram above, form a circle through points and , tangent to edge of the triangle (the center of this circle is at the point where the perpendicular bisector of meets the line through point that is perpendicular to ). Symmetrically, form a circle through points and , tangent to edge , and a circle through points and , tangent to edge . These three circles have a common point, the first Brocard point of . See also Tangent lines to circles.
The three circles just constructed are also designated as epicycles of . The second Brocard point is constructed in similar fashion.
Trilinears and barycentrics of the first two Brocard points.
Homogeneous trilinear coordinates for the first and second Brocard points are:
formula_6
Thus their barycentric coordinates are:
formula_7
The segment between the first two Brocard points.
The Brocard points are an example of a bicentric pair of points, but they are not triangle centers because neither Brocard point is invariant under similarity transformations: reflecting a scalene triangle, a special case of a similarity, turns one Brocard point into the other. However, the unordered pair formed by both points is invariant under similarities. The midpoint of the two Brocard points, called the Brocard midpoint, has trilinear coordinates
formula_8
and is a triangle center; it is center X(39) in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers. The third Brocard point, given in trilinear coordinates as
formula_9
is the Brocard midpoint of the anticomplementary triangle and is also the isotomic conjugate of the symmedian point. It is center X(76) in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers.
The distance between the first two Brocard points and is always less than or equal to half the radius of the triangle's circumcircle:
formula_10
The segment between the first two Brocard points is perpendicularly bisected at the Brocard midpoint by the line connecting the triangle's circumcenter and its Lemoine point. Moreover, the circumcenter, the Lemoine point, and the first two Brocard points are concyclic—they all fall on the Brocard circle, of which the segment connecting the circumcenter and the Lemoine point is a diameter. The tangents to the Brocard circle at the first two Brocard points concur at the isogonal conjugate of the third Brocard point.
Distance from circumcenter.
The Brocard points and are equidistant from the triangle's circumcenter :
formula_11
Similarities and congruences.
The pedal triangles of the first and second Brocard points are congruent to each other and similar to the original triangle.
If the lines , each through one of a triangle's vertices and its first Brocard point, intersect the triangle's circumcircle at points , then the triangle is congruent with the original triangle . The same is true if the first Brocard point is replaced by the second Brocard point .

Marriage Guidance Counsellor

The Marriage Guidance Counsellor sketch is from the second "Monty Python's Flying Circus" episode, "Sex and Violence", first broadcast late on Sunday, 12 October 1969. Written by Eric Idle, it was also featured in the 1971 spinoff film "And Now for Something Completely Different".
The sketch features Michael Palin and Carol Cleveland as a married couple (Arthur and Deirdre Pewtey) and Eric Idle as their marriage counsellor. The marriage guidance counsellor flirts with a receptive Mrs Pewtey rather than giving the couple advice, and Mr Pewtey fails to react to this behaviour and stand up for himself, even to the point where he meekly leaves the room when asked by the counsellor, who is clearly about to make love to Mrs. Pewtey. In the TV version, an American cowboy (John Cleese) convinces him he must "be a man" while in the film, the voice of God (also Cleese) convinces him.
When Mr. Pewtey again compliantly retreats in response to the counsellor's demand to leave the amorous couple alone, the TV version of the sketch features him, in a familiar Python prank, getting hit in the head with a chicken by a knight in a suit of armour (Terry Gilliam). In "And Now for Something Completely Different", it instead features another routine Python prank, a giant 16-ton weight being dropped onto Pewtey's body. The words "So much for Pathos!" pop up, ending both versions of the sketch.

Takeuchi Seihō

 (December 20, 1864 – August 23, 1942) was a Japanese painter of the "Nihonga" genre, active from the Meiji through the early Shōwa period. One of the founders of "nihonga", his works spanned half a century and he was regarded as master of the prewar Kyoto circle of painters. His real name was .
Biography.
Seihō was born in Kyoto. As a child, he loved to draw and wanted to become an artist. He was a disciple of Kōno Bairei of the Maruyama-Shijō school of traditional painting. In 1882, two of his works received awards at the "Naikoku Kaiga Kyoshinkai" (Domestic Painting Competition), one of the first modern painting competitions in Japan, which launched him on his career.
During the Exposition Universelle in Paris (1900), he toured Europe, where he studied Western art. After returning to Japan he established a unique style, combining the realist techniques of the traditional Japanese Maruyama–Shijo school with Western forms of realism borrowed from the techniques of Turner and Corot. This subsequently became one of the principal styles of modern "Nihonga". His favorite subjects were animals -often in amusing poses, such as a monkey riding on a horse. He was also noted for his landscapes.
From the start of the "Bunten" exhibitions in 1907, Seihō served on the judging committee. In 1909 he became a professor at the Kyoto Municipal College of Painting (the forerunner to the Kyoto City University of Arts). Seihō also established his own private school, the "Chikujokai". Many of his students later went on to establish themselves as noted artists, including Tokuoka Shinsen and Uemura Shōen.
In 1913, Seihō was appointed as an Imperial Household Artist, and in 1919 was nominated to the . He was one of the first persons to be awarded the Order of Culture when it was established in 1937.
He initially used the characters 棲鳳 for the first name of his pseudonym, and this name was possibly pronounced as "Saihō".
Important works.
 
Due to his travels in Europe, he was exposed to a number of western styles and ideas. Visiting Dresden Zoo, he was able to see a lion for the first time and painted it for one of his screens. Another work were two panels of elephants. 
Later in his life he returned to more traditional Japanese motifs and painted smaller animals such as cats and fish.

LGBTQ rights in Argentina

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) rights in Argentina rank among the highest in the world. Upon legalising same-sex marriage on 15 July 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America, the second in the Americas, and the tenth in the world to do so. Following Argentina's transition to a democracy in 1983, its laws have become more inclusive and accepting of LGBT people, as has public opinion.
Argentina also "has one of the world's most comprehensive transgender rights laws": its Gender Identity Law, passed in 2012, allows people to change their legal gender without facing barriers such as hormone therapy, surgery or psychiatric diagnosis that labels them as having an abnormality. Because of the law, as well as the creation of alternative schools and the first transgender community centre, BBC Mundo reported in 2014 that "Argentina leads the trans revolution in the world." In 2015, the World Health Organization cited Argentina as an exemplary country for providing transgender rights.
Societal acceptance is also very high. In a 2020 Pew Research Center poll, Argentina was ranked the South American country with the most positive societal attitudes towards homosexuality, with about three-quarters (76%) of those surveyed saying it should be accepted. The country's capital and largest city, Buenos Aires, has become an important recipient of LGBT tourism and has been described as "South America's gay capital". Nevertheless, reports of bullying against LGBT people, especially youth, are still common.
History.
Pre-colonial times.
Prior to Spanish colonisation, multiple groups inhabited modern-day Argentina. These include the Mapuche and the Guaraní people, both of whom accepted homosexual relations or viewed them with indifference. Traditionally, the Mapuche recognised a third gender called . The Mapuche did not possess the typical Western notions of sex or sexuality. Indeed, individuals were regarded as neither male or female, but as some sort of mix between the two. would typically play certain important societal roles, including being a machi, a Mapuche shaman. The Guaraní people are also on record as having accepted homosexuality.
The arrival of the Spanish Empire in the 16th century resulted in the spread of Christianity in Argentina, which in turn introduced negative attitudes towards homosexuality. The Spanish reportedly referenced the indigenous peoples as "savages" for engaging in homosexual activity, and called the Mapuche the "sodomites of Patagonia". Sodomy was apparently one of the reasons the Spanish conquistadors declared war against the local peoples. Following the creation of Spanish governorates in South America, sodomy became punishable with burning at the stake.
Independence and early 20th century.
Same-sex sexual activity has been legal since 1887, when "Law No. 1,920" () enacted Argentina's first federal Penal Code. The Penal Code made no reference to consensual sexual acts between adults. However, until recently, several local regulations issued by provincial, municipal and local authorities targeted "homosexualism". LGBT people were heavily persecuted under these regulations.
During the 19th century, writings on homosexuality treated it as a medical pathology, an accusation to be levied against political opponents or something brought into the nation by foreigners. The only public image of homosexuality was urban prostitution and public locations used for cruising. In 1914, a homosexual-themed play named "Los Invertidos" was forced to shut down, although medical journals were permitted to discuss homosexuality.
Police harassment of homosexuals is reported to have increased during the first military coup of 1930 which initiated the Infamous Decade. The cadet scandal of 1942 led to the most violent persecution against gay men in Argentine history, with a series of police raids and defamations that managed to imprison many homosexuals, led others into exile and resulted in two suicides. It led to the enabling of brothels in the vicinity of military barracks in 1944. Reports on the policies during the Peronist terms (1946 to 1955) are vague and contradictory. In 1946, Eva Perón extended her personal protection to Miguel de Molina, and some reports claim that Juan Perón ordered the police and the military not to engage in gay bashings.
Dirty War.
The first LGBT rights organization to be established was "Nuestro Mundo" in 1967 by Héctor Anabitarte. It represented the "homosexual liberation front" that sought an alliance with the political left in order to advance civil rights. Driving the creation of "Nuestro Mundo" was the dictatorship of Juan Carlos Onganía whose regime heavily suppressed and subjugated members of the LGBT community. Although a landmark moment in the LGBT rights movement in Argentina as a whole, the creation of "Nuestro Mundo" did not usher in an age of reforms nor increased rights for those in the community. Instead, the group generally avoided being politically active and was primarily concerned with bringing awareness to the oppression the LGBT community faced. It especially focused on ending police brutality against homosexuals and called for the end of anti-LGBT laws. Although "Nuestro Mundo" itself did not have many successes, it inspired the creation of other LGBT groups, such as "Safo", a lesbian organization. "Nuestro Mundo" eventually combined with other activist groups—"Safo", "El Grupo Profesionales", "Emanuel", "Alborada", "Bandera Negrea", and "Eros"—to establish the "Frente de Liberación Homosexual" (FLH) in 1971, which lasted until 1976. The new organization was created only two years after the Stonewall Riots in New York City, an event that galvanized activists in Argentina.
In the five years it existed, FLH aligned itself with feminists, Marxists, and other left-winged groups and was more openly politically active than its predecessors. Although its political goals were similar to those of Western organizations—of which were models for LGBT activism—its methods differed from those in the West. For instance, FLH was less concerned with establishing a consolidated democracy; instead it was focused on generating freedom and equality via anti-imperialism and "working-class politics", hence the alliances with leftist organizations that were not necessarily involved primarily in LGBT activism.
The 1976 coup and the beginning of a new dictatorship eradicated this movement. Twice, LGBT activists and community members were directly attacked by the regime. In preparation for the 1978 World Cup, which was being held in Argentina, the military—and possibly local police as well—underwent a "cleansing" process in which they arrested, beat, and violently suppressed members of the LGBT community. A second cleansing initiated by the paramilitary organization Comando Cóndor took place from January 1982 to January 1983. During this period, 18 gay men—including an FLH activist—were murdered. In 2023, numerous trans women survivors of imprisonment at a regime blacksite, testified in court about the experience of being hunted by the state, and, once imprisoned, forced to perform sexual acts in exchange for food.
Contemporary times.
The return to democracy in 1983 allowed for the creation of an LGBT rights movement. During this initial era of democratization, the first gay bar opened and the LGBT community began to become more open, with pride festivals, publications and political activism. Out of this came the founding of the "Comunidad Homosexual Argentina" (CHA) in April 1984, by among others Carlos Jáuregui. The organization maintained its strength and uniformity through the 1980s, before beginning to splinter in the 1990s. Groups of all kinds began to form out of CHA, such as the "Convocatoria Lesbiana", "Sociedad de Integración Gay-Lésbica Argentina", and "Transexuales por el Derecho a la Vida y la Identidad". As these groups and many others became increasingly political and wanted institutional, legal change, they eventually came to a consensus in 2006: they needed to band together to create one uniform organization that would allow them to effectively create change. Thus came about the "Federación Argentina de Lesbianas, Gays, Bisexuales y Transexuales" (FALGBT).
Although influenced by CHA, FALGBT was different: it was particularly focused on legalizing same-sex marriage; it is considered an "umbrella organization", and therefore is less centralized; and is more concerned with issues outside of rights for gay men, such as rights for gay women and feminism. Furthermore, it was less concerned with conforming to heteronormative ideas of gender and sexuality than CHA—openly endorsing and supporting transgender people and others who challenge the gender binary. FALGBT went so far as to rival CHA's attempts at legalizing civil unions for same-sex couples to instead demand full, legal marriages. FALGBT was heavily influenced by Spain, especially after Spain—a Catholic country like Argentina—legalized same-sex marriage. Spain's "Federación Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales" (FELGTB) is considered to be the model for the organisation. These reasons are why CHA is still a separate entity from FALGBT. Since the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2010, FALGBT has continued to advocate for rights and representation of LGBT people in Argentina. Its other successes include: passing the "Gender Identity Law" in 2012, which allows people to legally change gender without permission from medical or healthcare providers and also ensures non-binary, transgender, or gender non-conforming individuals get equal access to healthcare; the repealing of the Fault Codes, a collection of laws that "criminalized sex diversity"; getting pro-LGBT sex education to be taught in schools; passing laws that protect LGBT students from bullying and other forms of harassment; and lastly passing a law allowing for LGBT families to use reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilization without discrimination.
After both the creation of FALGBT and the legalization of same-sex marriage, there has been more visibility for LGBT people in Argentina. For instance, in 2007, the International Gay World Cup was held in Buenos Aires, with the Argentinian team winning. In recent years, there has also been an effort to encourage LGBT tourists to visit Buenos Aires, with the hope that the increased tourism will help the economy.
Despite these advances, there are still instances of what could be considered anti-LGBT sentiments in the Argentine government and judicial system. In 2015, a judge reduced the sentence of a man convicted of raping a six-year-old boy, on the basis that the young child had a "homosexual orientation". "Agence France-Presse" reported that Aníbal Fernández called for the impeachment of the judges that made that decision, describing it as "one of the biggest disgraces we've ever seen in this country".
Recognition of same-sex relationships.
Background.
In 2005, following the institution of civil unions in the province Río Negro and the city of Buenos Aires, a judge ordered prison authorities in the Córdoba Province to allow conjugal visits between gay prisoners and their partners. The laws approving civil unions for same-sex couples in both the city of Buenos Aires and the Río Negro Province were endorsed in 2002 and 2003, respectively, and in the town of Villa Carlos Paz in 2007. In 2009, the city of Río Cuarto also began allowing civil unions. These unions provided many of the same rights and privileges as that of married couples, however, adoption of children were not included among them. "Coexistence unions" () were eventually made legal nationwide on 1 August 2015 after the "Código Civil y Commercial", which replaced the former Civil Code, came into effect.
An early 2007 poll showed that 75% of those surveyed in the city of Buenos Aires believed that gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry, whereas 66% of Argentines supported same-sex marriage in 2009, if consideration was given to the whole country.
2009 court ruling.
In November 2009, a judge ruled that the prohibition of same-sex marriage was unconstitutional and permitted a male couple, Alex Freyre and Jose Maria Di Bello, to be married. The decision was hailed as a "legal first" by Reuters who said it was "setting a precedent that could pave the way for the Catholic country to become the first in Latin America to allow same-sex marriage". Freyre and Di Bello confirmed they were "the first same-sex couple in Latin America to get the right to marry". The Chief of Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, confirmed he would not be appealing the decision. Macri said that the decision was "an important step, because we must learn how to live in freedom without hurting the rights of others", later adding that "we must cohabit, and accept this reality. The world is heading toward that direction". The wedding was finally suspended after another judge revoked the original decision in late . Finally, on 28 December 2009, the couple got married in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego Province, becoming the first same-sex married couple in Latin America. They were supported by the Governor of Tierra del Fuego, Fabiana Ríos, who signed a decree approving the wedding based in the judicial rule of . Because that decision applied only in the case presented by Freyre and Di Bello, other same-sex couples had to appeal to the Judicial Power, wait for the resolution of unconstitutionality and then go to Tierra del Fuego to marry.
Same-sex marriage legalization.
The first pro-marriage bill championed by the FALGBT was introduced in 2007, and although it failed, it brought the issue of same-sex marriage to the public's attention and allowed for two other bills to be introduced in 2009.
Same-sex marriage was legalized in Argentina on 15 July 2010, after a positive vote in both the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) and the Senate (upper house). Same-sex couples are thus eligible for the same benefits and protections as opposite-sex couples (including adoption). Some cities also have civil union laws that continue to be in place as an alternative to marriage, but offer more limited rights. After the law was passed, Argentina became the country in the Americas to legalise same-sex marriage, as well as the in Latin America, and the worldwide, following Belgium, Canada, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.
Leading up to the legalization of same-sex marriage, the Catholic Church in Argentina worked endlessly against same-sex marriage. However, unlike in other Latin American countries—where the Church may have been more successful—Argentina is a relatively secular society. Church attendance rates are among the lowest in Latin America (only 22% of the population regularly attended church in 2014) making it less likely that Argentinians are directly influenced by the Church on certain issues such as same-sex marriage.
Adoption and parenting.
Same-sex couples have been able to legally adopt since July 2010, when the same-sex marriage legislation went into effect.
Since 2013, lesbian couples have had equal access to IVF. A law allowing such procedures was approved by the House of Deputies 204 votes to 1 with 10 abstentions in June 2013.
Article 562 on "Procreative will" of the Civil and Commercial Code establishes the following: "Those born through assisted human reproduction techniques are children of the person who gave birth and of the man or woman who has also given their prior, informed and free consent in the terms of articles 560 and 561, duly registered in the Civil Registry and Capacity of Persons, regardless of who provided the gametes."
In 2024, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled for the first time on a case involving surrogacy. It rejected the claim of a gay couple who had a child through a surrogate and demanded that a new birth certificate be made in which the woman was not listed. The judges held that it was not possible based on the Civil and Commercial Code.
Discrimination protections.
Since February 2024, the anti-discrimination agency was abolished and shutdown by the government of Argentina, along with many other agencies in order to reduce public spending.
, no national law exists to expressly deal with discrimination or harassment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, although the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and the city of Rosario (the third most populous of the country) do include sexual orientation in their civil rights and anti-discrimination laws. On 13 August 2010, the Chamber of Deputies approved an amendment to the anti-discrimination law banning discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, but it was not voted by the Senate. A new proposal was introduced in May 2013.
On 27 March 2015, a comprehensive federal anti-discrimination law was introduced to the National Congress by a leading LGBT rights group and several members of Congress. The bill's first debate in a commission was on 29 April, but it was later stalled. A new bill was introduced in the Senate in June 2016.
Discrimination against employees of the National Public Administration () on the basis of their sexual orientation has been illegal since 2006.
Hate crime law.
In 2012, the Penal Code was amended to provide a penalty of up to life imprisonment for hate crimes based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression.
Article 80(4) of the Penal Code ("Delitos contra las personas", "Crime against individuals") states that life imprisonment shall be imposed to anyone who kills for pleasure, greed and hatred based on racial, religious reasons, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression.
Gender identity and expression.
Discrimination and harassment on the account of gender identity remain a problem, although the transgender community has become more visible and politically organized.
In 1997, the "Asociación de Lucha por la Identidad Travesti-Transsexual" was created to defend the rights of transgender people. One of its first victories came in 2006 when the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that had stated that transgender people did not have a legal right to organize and campaign for their rights.
In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that a 17-year-old had the legal right to go through the sex change process and have her legal documents changed to reflect the operation.
In 2009, Marcela Romero won the legal right to have her identity changed, and was given an honorary title by the government. She was awarded by the Honorable Congresswoman of the year. Romero remains one of the leading advocates for the human rights of transgender people in Argentina.
In 2012, the Senate unanimously approved the Gender Identity Law (). This law grants adults sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy as a part of their public or private health care plans. The law also allows for changes to gender, image or birth name on civil registries without the approval of a doctor or a judge. In 2013, a six-year-old girl named Luana, who was designated male at birth, became the first transgender child in Argentina to have her new name officially changed on her identity documents. She is believed to be the youngest to benefit from the country's "Gender Identity Law".
Mendoza Province and Santa Fe Province were the first jurisdictions in the country to allow individuals to leave their sex entry blank instead of choosing "male" or "female". On 20 July 2021, President Alberto Fernández signed a Necessity and Urgency Decree (Decreto 476/2021) mandating the National Registry of Persons (RENAPER) to allow a third gender option on all national identity cards and passports, marked as an "X". The measure applies to non-citizen permanent residents who possess Argentine identity cards as well. In compliance with the Gender Identity Law, this made Argentina one of the few countries in the world to legally recognize non-binary gender on all official documentation.
In February 2025, President Javier Milei's government implemented a ban on gender affirming care under the age of 18, as part of Milei's war on "woke ideology". In April 2025, a Federal Court ruled that the ban was unconstitutional, restoring access to care for minors nationwide.
Military service.
On 27 February 2009, Argentina's Parliament passed a broad military reform act. One of the provisions of the law allows gay, lesbians and bisexuals to serve in the military and bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation within the armed forces. The law became effective six months after passage.
Blood donation.
In September 2015, Argentina abolished its ban on gay and bisexual men donating blood.
Conversion therapy.
Since 2010, no diagnosis can be made in the field of mental health on the exclusive basis of "sexual choice or identity".
HIV/AIDS and sex education.
Comprehensive sexual education has traditionally been and still somewhat remains a taboo topic in Argentine politics. As such, it has been difficult to implement a preventative campaign that will target youth due to religious objections from clergy, parents and local officials. Likewise, while health care is the right of each citizen, it is often elusive for people living in rural communities. Much of the funding for public education and treatment has come from private charities, NGOs and international organizations.
Argentina enacted a sex education law in 2006, though it has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent bullying of LGBT youth. In 2017, the Government launched a digital platform that informs young people of a variety of topics "in a fun, friendly and visual way". The platform touches on topics, such as gender-based violence, LGBT rights, contraception, eating disorders and drugs.
Argentina enacted an HIV/AIDS law in 1990, the 23.798 HIV/AIDS National Law, which has also been criticised. Critics pointed to its failure to cater to people living with other STDs apart from HIV/AIDS and for this reason, two different projects were presented in 2016 and 2018 with the aim of modifying the existing 1990 law.
In Article 1, the 23.798 HIV/AIDS National Law declares a national interest in the fight against Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which involves the detection and investigation of its causal agents, the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, its prevention, assistance and rehabilitation, as well as measures taken to prevent its propagation. Moreover, it establishes the National Ministry of Health and Social Action as the national body which will be in charge of enforcing the law. Also, it states that the respective sanitary authorities of each jurisdiction will be in charge of the implementation of the law. Further, the law states that it is compulsory to detect HIV and its antibodies present in the human blood destined for blood transfusions and plasma. It also makes it compulsory to test donors whose organs will be transplanted and discard the blood samples and organs for transplantation that show positivity for HIV.
Towards the end of the year 2015, the National Ministry of Health, together with representatives of 35 organizations of civil society, including scientific institutions, organizations working in the field and people living with HIV, finished their long-term project through introduce modifications to the 1990 law, and created the HIV/AIDS law project (E6139-D-16), which they presented to Congress in 2016.
According to this project, the law should be modified to declare a national interest not only in the fight against, prevention, diagnoses, investigation, control and integral treatment for AIDS, but also for hepatitis and other sexually transmitted diseases. The project also aims to end the discrimination against and stigmatization of people living with these diseases. In addition, it declares of national interest the medicines, vaccines and products for the treatment of HIV, hepatitis and other sexually transmitted diseases, as well as the investigation and the development of local technologies for the national public production of such supplies which guarantee the sustainability of public policies and the defense of the national sanitary sovereignty.
The project also involved the creation of the National Commission of HIV, Hepatitis and STD, composed of representatives of state agencies, Argentine citizens from organizations of people living with HIV and STDs, and scientific institutions, among others. Further, the project promotes both the setting up of a special fund aimed at strengthening organizations of people living with HIV and hepatitis, whose purpose would be to guarantee the observance of the new law, and the creation of a national body concerned with stigma and discrimination associated with HIV, hepatitis and STDs with the purpose of making the issues visible and combating the violation of human rights that people living with HIV and AIDS suffer.
Other important innovations included in the 2016 project are making it compulsory both the offering of HIV tests diagnoses in every medical visit and the detection not only of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), but also of hepatitis and other STD, and their antibodies present in the human blood that will be eventually used for blood or plasma transfusions. Regarding what the 1990s law stated about the investigation of donors whose organs will be transplanted, this new project holds the same view while also including the previously mentioned diseases.
When it comes to HIV and AIDS in the fields of work and education, the 2016 project aims to advance the protection of the rights of workers and students who may face discrimination and hostility regarding their HIV/AIDS status by, for example, forbidding companies and schools to require workers and students to disclose their HIV status as a prerequisite for admission.
The 2016 law project was presented twice in 2016 and 2017. In 2016 it was successfully approved in the Health Commission but it eventually failed to become a law. The following year, it was presented again but Congress gave priority to the discussion of the Argentine Labour Reform, and so the treatment of the project was delayed.
In 2018, two years after the 2016 law project was presented to Congress, a new project (3550-D-2018) was taken to Congress with aims similar to those of the previous one. This represented a second attempt at updating the 1990 HIV/AIDS National Law, and it did not succeed either. Furthermore, the 2018 Law project was rejected again in the year 2019.
Living conditions.
Since the end of the dictatorship in 1983 and the subsequent transition to a free democracy, Argentina has seen a significant shift in public attitudes towards LGBT people. During the dictatorship, LGBT people were actively persecuted; many were murdered, beaten, raped or disappeared. Homosexuality, transgender people and same-sex relationships were viewed as "disordered", "decadent" and "sub-human" by society, the military regime and the Catholic Church. In the decades following the dictatorship, Argentina has made "big strides" in recognising the legal rights of LGBT people. Multiple LGBT organisations were formed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, campaigning for the rights of LGBT people and raising public awareness of their cause. In 2010, the country became the tenth worldwide to legalise same-sex marriage, despite opposition from the influential Catholic Church. Other legal reforms include enacting a hate crime law to cover sexual orientation and gender identity, the legalisation of civil unions, allowing same-sex couples to adopt, allowing gay and bisexual men to donate blood, banning conversion therapy, and the passage of a transgender recognition law, which led the BBC Mundo to state that "Argentina leads the trans revolution in the world." Societal attitudes have also evolved significantly, going from public hostility and antipathy to acceptance and tolerance. A 2013 poll showed that 74% of Argentinians believed homosexuality should be accepted by society. This number was 81% among younger respondents. According to a 2009 survey, two-thirds of Argentinians were in favour of same-sex marriage. This increase in societal acceptance has led and encouraged members of the LGBT community to enter the public eye and come out.
Argentina is frequently referred to as one of the most LGBT-friendly South American countries. There is a visible LGBT scene in Buenos Aires, the capital, with many gay bars, nightclubs, cafés, restaurants and other venues and events. Nickname "South America's gay capital", Buenos Aires has become an important recipient of LGBT tourism. Due to same-sex marriage bans there, many couples from neighbouring come to Buenos Aires to marry, as Argentina does not have any residency requirements for marriage. Outside Buenos Aires, there are visible LGBT scenes in Córdoba, Rosario, Mendoza, Puerto Madryn, Ushuaia, and Mar del Plata.
In May 2015, PlanetRomeo, an LGBT social network, ranked Argentina as the second happiest South American country for gay men, after Uruguay.
Pride parades.
Buenos Aires Pride ("Marcha del Orgullo LGBT de Buenos Aires") is an annual pride parade held in the city. First held in 1992, it was attended by about 300 participants, and since then has been growing each year. In 2018, an estimated 100,000 people took part in the festivities. Other cities including Córdoba and Mendoza have held pride parades since 2008 and 2011, respectively; both with good attendance.
Public opinion.
A 2020 Pew Center Research opinion poll ranked Argentina the most positive South American country in regards to societal attitudes towards homosexuality, with about three-quarters (76%) of those surveyed saying it should be accepted. The acceptance is further higher among young people (82%). A majority of Argentinians support the legality of same-sex marriage.

Magic Steps

Magic Steps is the opening book of "The Circle Opens" quartet of young adult fantasy novels by Tamora Pierce. It is preceded by the "Circle of Magic" quartet, taking place four years after the conclusion of "Briar's Book". It portrays the adventures of Sandrilene fa Toren, the noble thread mage and her first experience as a teacher of magic.
Plot.
Sandry, now fourteen years old, has temporarily moved out of Discipline Cottage into the ducal palace in Summersea to look after her great-uncle Duke Vedris after he suffers a heart attack. While out riding in the city one morning, she sees a twelve-year-old boy named Pasco Acalon performing a dance for luck over fishing nets. Sandry senses magic in the dance, though Pasco denies that he has any magical ability. Moreover, Pasco’s family are all employed in the city watch, known as the harriers, and do not approve of his ambition to be a dancer. 
Vedris and Sandry learn that Jamar Rokat, the patriarch of a wealthy merchant family from overseas, has been gruesomely murdered in his home. Although Rokat’s home was heavily protected with magic, none of the defensive spells were triggered.
Meanwhile, when Pasco is bullied by two of his cousins, he accidentally creates a spell with his movements to protect himself. Finally convinced of his innate talent, the boy goes to Sandry and asks for her help.
Jamar Rokat’s brother Qasam goes to the duke to beg for protection, explaining that the Dihanurs, a rival merchant house in the Rokats’ home city of Bihan, are seeking to eliminate the entire Rokat family everywhere. The duke lends Qasam an armed escort. However, the Dihanur assassins - a married couple named Alzena and Nurhar and an unnamed mage - have a mysterious ability to make themselves invisible and unaffected by magic. They attack the party in the street, killing Qasam. 
During the fight, a guard is injured, and Sandry and a harrier mage named Wulfric Snaptrap see a magical “shadow” on his wound. Sandry removes the shadow and puts it aside for later study. Wulfric learns that the source of the shadow is the Dihanur's mage, who is unusual - he does not create magic, but annuls it, making spells useless. Those who work with “unmagic” often go mad, as it negates vitality and energy. 
Pasco continues his lessons with Sandry. He struggles with the focus and discipline needed, and Sandry in turn becomes irritated by his distractability and disobedience, though she grows fond of him. She also finds him a dancing teacher, a retired performer named Yazmin Hebet. 
The assassins, despite becoming careless and apathetic from their exposure to unmagic, nevertheless succeed in killing a clerk named Fariji Rokat, his wife, and their two children. When Sandry goes to the scene of the crime, she sees more smears of unmagic all along the street. Sandry and Wulfric cleanse the street, gathering up and storing the unmagic. All remaining members of the Rokat family in the city are taken to the palace for protection.
When Wulfric and Sandry return to Fariji’s home the day after the murder to cleanse it as well, they are attacked by the Dihanurs. Wulfric is slain and the killers escape, though not before Sandry notices that their bodies are tainted with unmagic. 
Sandry discovers that the unmagic tends to stick to itself and that her unique abilities allow her to spin and weave it like thread, which gives her an idea for how to set a trap for the assassins. Although Vedris initially refuses to consider her plan, he is shaken when Alzena penetrates the keep on a reconnaissance mission, and he allows his niece to go ahead.
One of the Rokats, a man named Durshan, volunteers to publicly announce that he is leaving the palace and returning to his home, to act as bait. Believing the killers can be caught and cleansed so they can face justice, Sandry weaves the unmagic into a net which she sets up in Durshan’s house. Pasco then dances the same charm of attraction over it that was used on the fishing nets. When the assassins arrive at the house, they capture Pasco but stumble into the net; holding the boy hostage, they demand to be released. Sandry instead spins a thread from all the unmagic in the room. The power has become so much a part of the trio that, when it is suddenly removed, Alzena and Nurhar’s bodies fall apart, and the mage dissolves into thin air.
In an epilogue, Pasco moves into Yazmin’s school to continue his dance training and his magic lessons with Sandry. Sandry visits her former teacher Lark at Discipline Cottage and is surprised to realize that, though she would be welcome to return if she wished, she has outgrown her old home, and it is time for her to take her place in the wider world. 
Publication and reception.
The book was first published in 2000, one year after "Briar's Book" concluded the original "Circle of Magic" quartet in 1999. A review by Janice M. Del Negro for the "Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books" says the book "serves more as set-up than as a well-developed story of its own" and "The characterizations are less richly layered, relying on the previous series to fill in the blanks".
"Kirkus Reviews" praised the book's "vibrant language" and "great energy." A review by Ann St. John for "Horn Book Magazine" notes the "grisly descriptions of the crime scenes and the ongoing murders are shocking" and states "Rather than being weighed down by the dark story line, however, the fantasy emphasizes Sandry's strength of character in the face of danger and focuses on her attempts to find a solution." In a review for "School Library Journal", Eva Mitnick observes, "the admirable heroine remains calm, capable, and always ready to giggle" and states, "Violent acts are horrifying but are not graphically described."
It was adapted into an audiobook in 2011 by Full Cast Audio. A review of the audio version by Sarah Flood for "School Library Journal" states, "Sandry and Pasco are likeable and strong-willed characters, and the full-cast narration captures their spunk and humorous interactions with Pierce taking the role of narrator."

Albert Ssempeke

Albert Ssempeke was a musician known for Baganda Music. He was also a royal musician to the Kabaka of Buganda, presumably Mutesa II of Buganda. Albert's album "Ssempeke!" is music from the pre-independence era of Buganda.
At age 11, Albert began playing the endere flute. He was tutored by the royal flautists and rose as a court musician. He also added the lyre, drums, and the eight-stringed kiganda harp to his repertoire. After the kingdom of Buganda was dissolved by Milton Obote, royal music declined because many refused to play it. The reign of Idi Amin led to its further decline when many people fled. By the 1980s, most people had either forgotten royal music or died, which left Albert as one of the last royal musicians, making him of interest to ethnomusicologists. In 1987, he was invited by Peter Cooke to be a "Musician in Residence" at the University of Edinburgh.

John Doherty (musician)

John Doherty (1900 – 26 January 1980) was an Irish folk fiddler.
Biography.
John Doherty was born in 1900 in Ardara, County Donegal. He came from a family of Irish Travellers who worked as tinsmiths and horse traders. His birth certificate was uncovered in recent years, firstly by Professor Alun Evans, and subsequently by researcher Caomhín Mac Aoidh, allowing confirmation that his date of birth was 1900, rather than 1895, which has been recorded in error in several publications. His father Mickey 'Mor' Doherty was a fiddler as were a number of his brothers and sisters. Mickey Doherty married Mary McConnell, a singer (whose brothers Alec and Mickey were well-known musicians in south Donegal). Together they had nine children and John was the youngest. In an interview in the 1970s, he said that he had to practice in the barn as a teenager, and was not allowed to play fiddle in the company of his parents until he had mastered "Bonny Kate". He heard recordings of James Scott Skinner and imitated his style. His brother, also called Mickey, tended to play more in the style of Michael Coleman. Mickey was also recorded, notably on the album "The Gravel Walks".
From the late 40s to the 1970s collectors sought him out. "The Floating Bow" contains recordings made between 1968 and 1974 by Professor Evans in the town-land of Glenconwell. This collection arguably comprises the most extensive collection of his music, and was made when some argue Doherty was at his peak as a musician. He played with much ornamentation, including bowed and slurred triplets, rolls, 'cuts', mordents (particularly on long 'first-finger' notes), double-stopping (based on standard western music principles, normally highlighting the tonic and third of a particular chord). Heavily influenced by the Scottish bagpiping tradition, he often replicated the sound of the pipes' drones, by either re-tuning the fiddle to an open tuning ('scordatura'), or by maintaining the fourth finger on the string below the pitch of the melody. According to Alex Monaghan in the magazine, "The Living Tradition", he was a significant influence on the fiddle playing of The Chieftains and Altan. Doherty was also a story-teller, and some of his tales appear on the liner notes to "The Floating Bow".
Doherty sometimes did not carry a fiddle with him on his travels because he knew that, if needed, he was always likely to be provided with one when he visited "house dances" (folk music parties hosted by a family in their own house). "The Floating Bow" was played on a borrowed fiddle (owned by Professor Evans). He once travelled to Dublin to play in the Oireachtas Championships. He was first recorded in 1945 by The Irish Folklore Commission during one of his trips to Teelin in Southwest Donegal and later by the BBC (Peter Kennedy) in Belfast in 1953. 10 of these 1953 recordings were issued on "Traditional Dance Music of Ireland" (various artists). Kennedy's recordings were later issued in three volumes on the Folktrax label, the first of which was "Pedlar's Pack" (1964). These recordings are available from Topic Records who now own the copyright. Paddy Glackin first met him in 1965, and was heavily influenced by John. He could probably be described as the last of the travelling fiddlers. He died in Ballyshannon Rock Hospital, County Donegal.

The Harp Consort

The Harp Consort is an international early music ensemble directed by Andrew Lawrence-King, specialising in Baroque opera, early dance-music, and historical World Music.
The Harp Consort improvises within the distinct baroque, renaissance, and medieval music styles. The group takes its inspiration from the 17th-century harp consort formed in England at the court of Charles I: in contrast to the homogeneous string orchestra (also formed at this time), the Consorte brought together diverse types of solo instruments – harp, lutes, keyboards, strings – and voices, to create colourful new combinations in the fashion of the day. Like the 17th-century Consorte, the Harp Consort is formed around the accompanying instruments of the basso continuo. It brings together an international team of musicians who create a rich variety of timbres.
CDs and awards.
The Harp Consort's debut CD, "Luz y Norte" (17th-century dance-music from Spain and South America, mainly from a collection by Ruiz de Ribayaz) gained a Diapason d’Or in France, Record of the Year from "Amadeus magazine" in Italy, and topped the classical charts for five weeks in Australia.
The ensemble's recordings on DHM include 'Carolan's Harp’; ‘Italian Concerto’ [Best Early Music CD, German Phonographic Academy]; the medieval ‘Ludus Danielis’; and "La púrpura de la rosa" [Noah Greenberg Award], the first New World opera, given in Lima, Peru in 1701. The ensemble has also recorded Lawes for Berlin Classics and Purcell for Astrée Auvidis, and formed the continuo band for Andrew Lawrence-King's recording of Handel's ‘Almira’ [American Handel Society CD of the year], for Vivaldi's ‘Four Seasons’ with the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra and for ‘Fire-Water’: Spanish renaissance ensaladas with The King's Singers.
The Harp Consort now records exclusively for Harmonia Mundi USA. Their first release was Missa Mexicana: festive polyphony and popular dances from 17th-century Mexico ("The Times" (London) CD of the Year). Their second CD, "Miracles of Notre Dame" (songs arranged by Gautier de Coincy, 13th-century Prior of Vic) won the Dutch "Edison" award: it was also Gramophone Magazine's Editor's Choice &amp; London Telegraph CD of the Year.

Spencer Tracy (band)

Spencer Tracy were an Australian rock band formed in 1999 in Collie, Western Australia. Founding mainstay members are Lee Jones on lead vocals and guitar, his brother Kim Jones on bass guitar and Shaun Sibbes on drums. They were joined by Jessica Bennett (ex-Lash) on co-lead vocals and guitar in 2002. After she left in the following year, John Rabjones joined on guitar to record the group's self-titled, debut album. They issued three extended plays, "Corner of My Eye" (March 2001), "Daisy Daze" (October) and "Hold On" (July 2003).
History.
Spencer Tracy were formed by three teenagers from Collie, Western Australia, Lee Jones on lead vocals and guitar, his brother Kim Jones on bass guitar and Shaun Sibbes on drums. They played in local pubs and reached the finals of the Next Big Thing band competition. They were signed to independent record label, Embryo Records, in 2000, when the members were aged 15, 16 and 18, having performed about 100 pub gigs. The group issued a split extended play (EP), "Split", in October 2000, with Perth band, Cartman providing two tracks each. Ryan Lee reviewed their CD launch performance, "'Battle of the Egos' is a great rock song with its powerful guitar and stunning lyrics... 'Fight' is without a doubt their most powerful and finely tuned rock song." "Battle of the Ego's" was picked up by national youth radio, Triple J. They were awarded $8,000 as part of the Contemporary Music Touring Program in order to tour New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.
The band's debut five track EP, " Corner of My Eye", which was released in March 2001 on Embryo Records, reached number 14 on the AIR Top 20 Singles Charts. The title track was described by R. Lee, as being "a fantastic tune, with terrific lyrics and a tight sound." It received airplay on Triple J and RTRFM, which led to tours of the Australian east coast and support slots with Echo and the Bunnymen, the Fauves, iOTA, Lo-Tel and Midnight Oil. The band received further airplay for "Stupid", one of five tracks from their second EP "Daisy Daze" (October 2001). Sibbes and Kim Jones finished secondary school and main songwriter Lee Jones began re-worked their sound.
In mid-2002 pianist Roger Woodward invited Lee to study classical piano at San Francisco State University but he decided to remain with the group. Lee wrote the tracks "Disco King" and "Ocean" while considering his options. Conversations with the group's talent and label manager, Rosco Stewart, and record producer Ben Glatzer assisted Lee's decision making. In September 2002 the band recruited John Rabjones, a friend from Collie, as their second guitarist.
"Disco King" was issued as a single in January 2003 and was broadcast on Triple J. The band toured with Regurgitator in that month, then performed at the Big Day Out, Perth (February), east coast gigs with Waikiki and Machine Gun Fellatio followed and a Western Australian tour with You Am I in March. More airplay followed in February with the Triple M network adding "Disco King" to official rotation in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Nova 96.9, Sydney and Nova 100, Melbourne ran the track in the high rotation Buzz bin for two consecutive weeks and NOVA 93.7 in Perth gave it airplay over a six-week period. The video clip to "Disco King" was broadcast on Channel V, MTV and "Rage". According to Jasper Lee of Oz Music Project, it was, "a promising single that reminds me of the days when singles were something that you could still listen for hours and hours over again."
Their second single "Ocean" was launched in June 2003 and was added to rotation on Triple J, 96FM (Perth), Nova 93.7 (Perth), K Rock (Geelong) and received airplay on Triple M the Nova networks and HotFM. In the following month Spencer Tracy toured Australia opening for international band, Veruca Salt. "Ocean" reached number 14 on the Australian Independent Record Labels Association (AIR) top 20 singles charts in September.
Spencer Tracy launched their debut self-titled album on 11 August 2003 with a series of gigs across Australia. It was recorded at Revolver Studio's in Western Australia with Ben Glatzer (Ammonia, The Sleepy Jackson, Cartman, Crawlspace) producing and engineering the album, which was released on Embryo Records (Veruca Salt, Cartman) on 11 August 2003. The album was selected as Triple J's feature album, (8–15 August) after spending a week in the number one position on their Net 50. It debuted at number 9 on the Australian Independent Record Labels Association (AIR) top 20 album charts in September. Oz Music Project's Soph Gyles observed, "it's a loose-fit collection of jingles for wasting away the summer, its bubblegum hooks accidentally dribbling out of your half-open mouth."
Also in that August 2003 they performed at Manchester's the City Unsigned and followed with shows in London, Sweden, New York and Los Angeles. Line up problems plagued the group at the end of 2003 and they toured Australia as a three-piece: Sibbes with Lee and Kim Jones. They later added Jessie Bennett (formerly of Perth band Lash) to the line-up. In November of that year they supported Welsh band, Super Furry Animals at that group's Perth show.
In 2004 Spencer Tracy were selected to perform at SXSW in Austin, Texas, and attracted international attention. Lee Jones unexpectedly left the band shortly afterwards to concentrate on his classical piano. Sibbes took up lead vocals, and after three rehearsals they performed at the Lotto Skyworks and Big Day Out, Perth to combined crowds of about 4,000 people. They then toured the new line-up in rural Western Australia. The band released their final release, the EP "Hold On".
The new line-up for Spencer Tracy toured the south-west of Western Australia with Jebediah and preparation was being made for a Japanese tour later in that year, with representatives of Japanese record label, Avex Trax, travelling to Perth to negotiate a deal for the band in Japan. The band also expanded their line up with Shaun Sibbes moving to front the band on guitar and vocals, and Nicolas Jonsson from The Avenues and Malcom Clarke from The Sleepy Jackson both filling the position on drums on different occasions. The group disbanded in November 2004.
Since their breakup Lee Jones has fronted Perth electronic act Astronaut, which won a WAMi Award in 2006 for 'Best Live Electronic Act' and subsequently joined The Sleepy Jackson in 2006 on keyboards and lead guitar. In April 2007, with The Sleepy Jackson not working, Lee joined Eskimo Joe's touring band playing keyboards, electric guitar and lap steel guitar. Jessica Bennett plays in The Preytells, National Campus Band Comp winners for 2005.
In 2009, Shaun Sibbes played drums as a session musician for Australian act Sneaky Sound System. He is also playing with Lee Jones again in The Sun Orchestra. Spencer Tracy performed in a tribute show in Collie in March 2019 in memory of Alison Pimm-Spry, who had died 20 years earlier.

Diarmuid Murphy

Diarmuid Murphy (born 22 August 1975 in Dingle, County Kerry) is an Irish Gaelic footballer who plays for his local club Dingle and was the goalkeeper at senior level on the Kerry county football team from 2004 until 2009.
Playing career.
Under 21.
Murphy was part of the Kerry Under 21 team in 1994 but lost out to Cork in the Munster championship.
He was still underage in 1995. He played no part in the Munster championship winning campaign, but returned to the team for the All-Ireland semi-final with Donegal that Kerry won. Murphy was the team's captain for the All-Ireland final with Mayo. The game ended in a 2-12 to 3-09 draw, Kerry won the re-play 3-10 to 1-12 to give Murphy an All-Ireland title as captain.
In his final year at the Under 21 grade Murphy picked up a Munster title after a win over Clare in the final. Kerry later qualified for another All-Ireland final with Cavan and another win gave Murphy a second All-Ireland medal.
Junior.
After success at Under 21 level Murphy joined the Kerry Junior side in 1997. He won a Munster title after overcoming Clare in the final. Kerry faced Mayo in the All-Ireland final. However Murphy and co came up short on a 2-08 to 1-10 scoreline.
He again lined out with the county junior side in 2000. He won a second Munster title after overcoming Clare once again. The All-Ireland final seen Kerry face another Connachat team in the shape of Roscommon. There was to be no joy once more as Kerry lost out 0-14 to 0-11.
He again lined out in 2001 but Kerry lost out to Tipperary in the first round of the Munster championship.
Senior.
Murphy first joined the Kerry senior panel in 2001 as back up for Declan O'Keeffe. Murphy played during the National Football League in 2002 and 2003, but remained as the sub for the championship.
2004 saw Jack O'Connor take over as manager of the Kerry team. He was not the only change in personnel, as Murphy replaced Declan O'Keeffe as the first-choice goalkeeper on the team after the first round of the league when Kerry had a surprise loss to Longford. The year began well with Kerry reaching the final of the National League. An exciting 3-11 to 1-6 victory saw Kerry claim the title and Murphy picked up a first National Football League winners’ medal. 'The Kingdom' subsequently booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and, for the second year in succession, Limerick were the opponents. Surprisingly, that game ended in a 1-10 apiece draw. The replay was also a close-run affair; however, Kerry never really looked in danger of losing. A 3-10 to 2-09 victory gave Murphy a Munster winners’ medal. The All-Ireland series proved no difficulty for Kerry, and ‘the Kingdom’ booked their place in the All-Ireland final against Mayo. An early goal from Alan Dillon gave the Connacht men some hope, however, the game was effectively over after twenty-five minutes when Colm Cooper scored Kerry's only goal of the day. The points kept coming from Murphy's team and an injury-time Michael Conroy goal was nothing but a consolation for Mayo. A 1-20 to 2-09 victory gave Murphy his first All-Ireland winners’ medal. Murphy was later presented with his first All-Star award.
In 2005 Kerry were hot favourites to retain their All-Ireland title. All was going to plan as Murphy's side reached yet another provincial final. In a return to tradition, Cork were the opponents. A close game developed, however, in the end Kerry were the narrow winners by 1-11 to 0-11. It was Murphy's second Munster winners’ medal. Following this win Kerry cruised through the All-Ireland series to reach another championship decider with Tyrone providing the opposition. In one of the great finals of the decade, the result remained in doubt until the final whistle. Dara Ó Cinnéide powered his team ahead with a goal after just six minutes. Tyrone responded in kind with a Peter Canavan goal just before half-time. Tomás Ó Sé launched the Kerry comeback in the 57th minute with Kerry's second goal; however, it was too late. Tyrone hung on to win by 1-16 to 2-10. It was Murphy's first defeat in an All-Ireland final. In spite of losing the All-Ireland Murphy was later presented with a second All-Star award.
In 2006 Kerry reached the final of the National League and played Galway. Murphy's side could only manage three points in the opening half, however, the introduction of Eoin Brosnan transformed the team. At the end of the seventy minutes a 2-12 to 0-10 score line gave Kerry their 18th National League title. The league win was a false dawn as Kerry went out tamely to Cork in a replay of the Munster final. The team, however, bounced back against Longford to set up a meeting with Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter-final. At half-time it looked as though the Ulser hoodoo would strike again but Kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half with Darragh Ó Sé dominating midfield while Kieran Donaghy shone at full-forward. They won by a score of 3-15 to 1-13, in the process putting an end to the notion that Kerry had no answer to the northern style of defensive play. Kerry again beat Cork in the subsequent semi-final before lining out against Mayo in the All-Ireland final. An unbelievable opening first-half saw Kerry go 2-4 to no score ahead after just ten minutes, courtesy of goals by Declan O'Sullivan and Kieran Donaghy goals. Colm Cooper slotted a third Kerry goal, however, Mayo settled and reduced the deficit to 3-8 to 3-2 at half-time. The second thirty-five minutes saw Kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points. A final score of 4-15 to 3-5 gave Kerry another All-Ireland title and gave Murphy a second All-Ireland winners' medal.
In 2007 Kerry faced Cork in the provincial decider once again. A close game developed, however, at the full-time whistle Kerry were the champions by 1-15 to 1-13. It was Murphy's third Munster winners' medal. Kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their All-Ireland quarter-final against Monaghan, setting up a glamour All-Ireland semi-final tie with Dublin. Murphy's side saw off a Dublin comeback and went on to win by two points. The subsequent All-Ireland final was an historic occasion as Kerry faced Cork in the very first all-Munster championship decider. While the first-half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second-half and a rout ensued. Cork goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3-13 to 1-9. It was a third All-Ireland medal for Murphy.
In 2008 Kerry launched an all-out attack in their pursuit of a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. All did not go to plan as Murphy's side lost team captain Paul Galvin to suspension after an incident with referee Paddy Russell in the Munster semi-final against Clare. The subsequent Munster final saw Kerry take an eight-point lead over Cork at half-time. 'The Rebels' fought back and, in a massive downpour, Kerry could only muster three points in the second period of play as Cork secured a remarkable 1-16 to 1-11 victory. Murphy's side worked their way through to the All-Ireland semi-final where they faced Cork once again. 'The Kingdom' were much better in this encounter, however, the game ended in an astonishing draw. Kerry won the replay after another great comeback by Cork. An All-Ireland final appearance against Tyrone was the reward for this victory, with Murphy lining out in goals again. An exciting game developed, one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years. The sides were level seven times before Colm Cooper nudged Kerry 0-8 to 0-7 ahead before the interval. Tyrone simply wore Kerry into the ground in the second-half as a priceless goal from Tommy McGuigan and a string of late points inspired Tyrone to their third All-Ireland title of the decade.
In 2009 speculation was mounting that Murphy was approaching the end of his career. In spite of this he had one of his best seasons in the green and gold. He picked up a third National League winners' medal after a final victory over Derry. Kerry's next game was a Munster semi-final meeting with Cork. That game ended in a draw, however, Kerry were well beaten in the replay. 'The Kingdom' were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over Longford, Sligo and Antrim. On several occasions it was Murphy's goalkeeping that kept Kerry in the championship. 'The Kingdom' later lined out in the All-Ireland quarter-final and thrashed Dublin before overcoming Meath in a disappointing semi-final. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Kerry face Cork for the third time in that year's championship. Murphy's side entered the game as slight underdogs, however, they had the trump card of having never lost a game to Cork at Croke Park. Kerry stuttered in the opening period and trailed by 0-1 to 1-3 early in the first-half. The Kerry team stuck to their gameplan while Cork recorded fourteen wides. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the champions again by 0-16 to 1-9. It was Murphy's fourth All-Ireland winners' medal. His contribution to the championship was later recognised when he picked up a third and final All-Star award.
In January 2010 Murphy became the first high-profile Kerry star to announce his retirement from inter-county football due to a back problem. He was followed into retirement a month later by midfielder Darragh Ó Sé. Murphy was replaced on the Kerry team by Brendan Kealy.
Selector.
In August 2010, it was announced that Murphy would join the Kerry management as a selector under coach Jack O'Connor.
In 2011, then Kerry manager Jack O'Connor brought him in as a selector to replace former team mate Éamonn Fitzmaurice. He continued as a selector under the management of Fitzmaurice when Fitzmaurice took over the Kerry senior football team.
Murphy was involved as a selector when O'Connor returned as Kerry manager in 2021. He spent three years working with O'Connor but left at the end of the 2024 season.

Majid Musisi

Majid Musisi (sometimes spelt Magid Musisi; 15 September 1967 – 13 December 2005) was a Ugandan footballer who played as a striker. He was the first Ugandan footballer to be signed for a European club.
Early life.
Musisi was born to Siraje Katende and Deborah Namutebi. He attended New Mulago Primary School and Bashir High School but then dropped out of school to pursue a football career.
Career.
Musisi, like several other football stars from the eighties, nurtured his football career at the renowned Mulago playground, popularly known as 'Maracana' in reference to the famous Brazilian stadium. Alongside the likes of Adam Semugabi and Rajab Sekalye, he was one of the top prospects at New Mulago Primary School.
Musisi was stocky-built, powerful and endowed with speed. In 1983, at just 16 years of age, the second-tier side Pepsi FC snapped him up. In the process, Majid Musisi abandoned his studies at Bashir High School in Wandegeya.
After playing an impressive season, SC Villa's tactician, David Otti, included the youngster in the Villa squad that was preparing for the Cecafa Club Championship in January 1985.
However, Majid Musisi missed the trip when his passport was delayed but made the Villa squad that travelled to Sudan three weeks later to face El-Hilal in the Africa Club Championship.
At the time, SC Villa was an emerging force with two league titles already under their belt. Rogers Nsubuga was the club's leading marksman, with Ronald Vubya and Shaban Mwinda following behind.
Under the new coach, Timothy Ayiekoh, Musisi would make his long-awaited debut against Maroons, scoring twice, then following up with one goal against Heroes. 
In August 1985, Majid's career entered one of his most famous games yet, Villa versus Express. Majid Musisi, given a rare start, scored two goals in the first four minutes to give SC Villa a 2–0 win over Express.
Additionally, in the 1986 season, Polly Ouma took over the team as Villa coach. On his part, he improved his 1985 tally of six goals to eight. SC Villa won its first league and Cup double that year.
Then the goals started flowing in 1987. He scored three goals as SC Villa won the Cecafa Club Championship, and when Nsubuga got sidelined by injury, Ouma played Majid Musisi in his favoured central role, scoring eight goals in the first six league games. After this performance, Cranes coach Barnabas Mwesiga handed the 20-year-old his debut in July 1987. and Majid would play in a 1988 Olympic qualifier game against Mozambique.
With Majid Musisi partnering, Phillip Omondi on the frontline, the combo beat the Mozambique side, with each picking up a brace in the 4–1 win. In the return leg, the duo scored a goal each in the 2–0 win to make sure of Uganda's progress to the next stage. At the end of the season, Musisi was crowned the top scorer with 28 goals.
Later that year, the pair defied a Fufa directive and appeared for their Lugave clan in the Bika By'Abaganda football championship, just days before the Olympic qualifier against Zambia. So, when the federation suspended them, there was a public outcry. FUFA eventually recalled the two players and ironically, it was Musisi and Vubya who made the difference as Uganda won the home leg 2–1.
However, Zambia would go on to eliminate Uganda, but when the two teams met in the CECAFA Cup later that year, Majid Musisi beat Zambia, scoring a hat-trick, and at the end of the event, he emerged as the top scorer. Additionally, he was voted the 1987 Footballer of the Year. Patrick Kawooya, the filthy rich SC Villa boss, was one of Musisi's biggest admirers. He rented him a plush house at Najjanankumbi, a Kampala suburb, fully furnished with a refrigerator, cooker, video system, standby generator and other luxuries.
"I remember one time Musisi came to me with a bag full of money, and we went to Kyebando where we purchased a plot of land, it was a lot of money", Majid Musisi's mother, Namutebi recollects. She says the entire family depended on Majid Musisi. "When he hit headlines, he took over the responsibility of the entire family and started paying school fees for about 12 of his siblings", she adds.
Majid Musisi and Kawooya were so close that in many ways, he [Musisi] was the go-between for other players.
"At the time, many of the upcoming Villa players like me used to channel our problems through Majid Musisi and the following day, you would get it", says Charles Sebugwawo former SC Villa player.
Goals, goals, goals
Because of his well-built frame and fearless approach no defender could go with him toe to toe. Fans nicknamed him 'Tyson,' which was a direct comparison to the then young boxing heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who also left destruction in his wake. 'Magic' is another popular tag they called him because of his style of play. In the 1988 season, however, Majid Musisi endured a dip in form and his self-belief took a hit.
Drama unfolded in the decisive league game against KCC, when Majid Musisi missed a couple of sitters and even failed to convert from the spot when the Jogoos were trailing 1–2. But when Vubya equalised with a few minutes left, Kawooya went on the touchline and usurped the powers of Geoff Hudson, Villa coach. He asked John Kaweesi to warm up in place of the misfiring Majid Musisi.
But just as they waited for a dead ball situation, Majid Musisi scored the winner in stoppage time and, ironically, Kawooya raced the full length of the pitch to carry Musisi shoulder high. At the end of the season, Majid Musisi scored a respectable 13 league goals. But that, by Majid Musisi's standards, was a step down despite missing a number of games due to an ankle injury.
Majid Musisi would later score a brace to eject KCC from the Uganda Cup before netting a spectacular goal against Express in the Uganda Cup final as Villa won the league and Cup double. A week later, he extended his act in the Bika By'Abaganda (Buganda Clans Football League, leading the Lugave clan to a 5–0 demolition of Ngabi in the final. The story was different in 1989; Musisi not only helped Villa to a third 'double' but also recaptured the top scorer's crown with 15 goals.
To cap a successful season, Majid Musisi topscored the CECAFA Cup with four goals – also converted in the final shootout as Uganda beat Malawi to win the event after 12 years. In 1990, SC Villa and Musisi remained dominant on the local scene, with the Jogoos retaining the league as Majid Musisi's 28 goals equalled Isa Sekatawa's three top-scoring awards. Earlier in September, he was a thorn in the DR Congo defence when he scored a late winner in the 2–1 triumph in a Nations Cup qualifier.
He was not done yet; in December, he put the icing on the cake as Uganda beat Sudan 2–0 to retain the CECAFA title. Unsurprisingly, he picked up a second 'Footballer of the Year' award. In 1991, he scored 17 league goals to become the first player to reach 100 league goals but Villa ended the season empty-handed.
However, they had every reason to celebrate after finishing runners-up in the Africa Club Championship. Majid Musisi scored a couple of goals in that fairytale campaign but what stood out was his diving header against Nigeria's Iwuanyanwu Nationale in the semi-final.
In 1992, Majid Musisi was on track to make light work of Jimmy Kirunda's record of 32 goals a season when he netted a mindboggling 29 goals in the league's first round. In his final league appearance, he tormented KCC goalie Sadiq Wassa to the extent that when he scored his fourth in the 5–0 win, he simply walked off the field as if to suggest that domestic opposition no longer matched his ambitions. Nevertheless, he extended his league tally to 144 goals.
It was a blessing in disguise when French side Stade Rennes signed the player for a whopping $180,000. Villa used part of that money to buy the Makindye-Luwafu club house.
Simply unstoppable
Majid Musisi can best be described as an orthodox forward, one who makes scoring look easy. He was a natural finisher who got the best out of his physical presence. He was also a deadball specialist. On the other hand, he was a tireless workhorse with exceptional firepower; added to pace, good dribbling skills and a great aerial presence, he was the most difficult striker to mark.
While many of today's strikers avoid tackles, Majid Musisi was a nightmare for man-markers. Yet despite his fearsome frame, Musisi was always composed and never lost his temper or retaliated yet many teams purposely set out to eliminate him.
Professional football
At Rennes, Majid Musisi was a regular presence and scored a number of crucial goals, which prompted Turkish side Bursaspor to sign him in 1997 for a reported $1m. He later moved to Dardanelspor, another Turkish club before he brought the curtain down on his professional career in 2001. "Dardanelspor still owes him money", says Nantongo, without disclosing the amount.
[Musisi (front row second right) at Dardanelspor]
Musisi (front row second right) at Dardanelspor
Majid Musisi returned to Uganda in 2001 and rejoined SC Villa. However, it was clear he was over the hill and failed to show the predatory skills of the past. He remained a key player for Uganda, captaining the side on several occasions and the highlight was a hat-trick in 1998 in the 5–0 win over Rwanda. However, he unceremoniously ended his Cranes career when Harrison Okagbue, the then coach threw him out of camp for breaching the team's code of conduct in 2000.
In 2002, he joined Vietnamese side Da Nang but returned in 2004 and joined Ggaba United. There, he failed to get off the mark and called it a day. For all the great goals he scored, Uganda's failure to qualify for the Nations Cup somehow dented his overall greatness. In 1991, Musisi and his Villa teammates turned down a national call-up before a crucial Nations Cup qualifier against DR Congo.
After spending two seasons with the Rennes in France where he played a total of 64 matches scoring 18 goals (League 2 and Coupe de France), he was sold to the Turkish top-flight club Bursaspor and later to Çanakkale Dardanelspor for 1.8 billion Ugandan shillings transfer fee ($1 million), making a record in the transfer market for the most expensive Uganda import. In the 1996 season, he was voted Best Foreign Player of the Year in the Turkish league. After playing in Turkey he had a spell playing for Đà Nẵng in Vietnam. He founded the now famous Bursaspor "crocodile walk" goal celebration during the UEFA Intertoto Cup match against German side Karlsruher SC on 2 August 1995.
Personal life.
Magid Musisi was married to Suzan Nantongo with whom he had separated shortly before his death. Musisi fathered seven children
Death.
He died after a long illness on 13 December 2005 at his mother's home in Bwaise, a city suburb of Kampala, where he had been staying after his condition worsened. His body was transferred to his Muyenga home, from where it was taken to neighbouring Bukasa for burial at 4pm on 14 December 2005.

The is a railway line operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) which connects to .
Both the Tobu and JR East railway stations in Nikkō are located within walking distance of each other.
History.
The Nippon Railway Co. opened the line in 1890 and was nationalised in 1906. The line was electrified in 1959, and CTC signalling was commissioned in 1970. Freight services ceased in 1984.
Former connecting lines.
The Tochigi Prefectural Government opened a 3 km gauge line to Nishihara-cho in 1897, extending it 10 km to Yoshihara in 1899 and opening a 4 km branch to Tokujiro the following year. Handcar passenger services commenced on both lines from opening, operating until 1928. A 7.5 km branch from Nishihara-cho to Tateiwa was opened in 1898 to haul gravel.
In 1931, the lines were purchased by the Tobu Railway Co. which closed all but the Tateiwa branch, which it converted to gauge and built a connection to Nishi-Kawada station on the Tobu Utsunomiya Line. The Tateiwa branch ceased operation in 1961 following a landslide and was formally closed in 1964.
The Nikko Electric Railway Co. opened an 8 km line electrified at 600 V DC to Iwanohana between 1907 and 1913, and extended it 2 km to Umakae (approximately 300 m higher than Nikko) in 1931 to connect to a 1.2 km funicular railway that climbed 428 m which opened in 1932. In 1944, electric locomotives began hauling copper ore on the line. Freight tonnage decreased 25% between 1964 and 1966, and passenger numbers decreased by 17% over the same period, resulting in the line closing in 1968. The funicular railway closed in 1970.

Janet and John

Janet and John is a series of early reading books for children, originally published in the UK by James Nisbet and Co in four volumes in 1949–50, and one of the first to make use of the "look and say" approach. Further volumes appeared later, and the series became a sales success in the 1950s and 60s, both in the UK and in New Zealand. By the 1970s, the books were considered outdated, and several updated versions were issued. Facsimiles of two of the original volumes were reprinted in 2007 to cater for the nostalgia market.
Origins.
The "Janet and John" books were originally based on the "Alice and Jerry" series published by Row Peterson and Company in the United States, a series that had been written by Mabel O'Donnell and illustrated by Florence and Margaret Hoopes.
In 1949, the publisher James Nisbet and Co licensed and republished them in the UK as a series of four books called "Janet and John". These had a new Anglicised text by Rona Munro, wife of John Mackenzie Wood who ran Nesbit and Co; she was originally a teacher from New Zealand. Illustrations were by Florence and Margaret Hoopes, with contributions from Christopher Sanders.
Publications.
The first volumes of the 1949–50 "Janet and John" series were simply called Books One to Four and presented, using limited vocabulary, incidents from the daily life of a brother and sister. Additional volumes soon followed: "Through the Garden Gate" (1950), "Off to Play" (1950), "I Know a Story" (1950), "Here We Go" (1951), and "Once Upon a Time" (1952). The books were described by the publishers as "true to the best in life of modern children".
Beginning in 1949, Nisbet released a version specially published for New Zealand, with the same authors and illustrators. There were seven books in all: "Out and About" (1949), I Know a Story (1949), "I Went Walking" (1949), "Here We Go" (1949), "Off to Play" (1949), "Through the Garden Gate" (1951), and "Once upon a Time" (1951). The only distinctive New Zealand feature was a Māori legend included in the final title, "Once Upon a Time". Eighty thousand copies of each book were distributed free to New Zealand schools from 1950. A further 20–30,000 of each were printed in 1956, and another 12–20,000 in 1959.
Heyday - 1950s and 1960s.
The books became a familiar aid for teaching schoolchildren throughout the 1950s and 1960s, being used in 81% of British primary schools in 1968. They were one of the first popular "look-and-say" or "whole word" reading schemes, the approach being to repeat words sufficiently frequently that children memorised them – in contrast with the phonics method in which children were encouraged to decode groups of letters.
1970s.
During the 1970s, new theories were developed on how children learn to read, and "real books" with "real stories" became increasingly popular. "Janet and John"s presentation of a middle-class nuclear family fell out of favour, and the series was discontinued in 1976.
"Kathy and Mark".
Working with Philippa Murray, Rona Munro created an updated series for Nisbet and Co called "Kathy and Mark". In the UK there were three "Kathy and Mark Little Book" collections, each of four volumes: Green 1-4 (1973), Orange 1-4 (1973), and Turquoise 1-4 (1974). They incorporated small in-line illustrations in place of certain words, such as 'umbrella'. Nisbet published a variety of "Kathy and Mark" books with other colours and titles.
2000s.
Star Kids version.
Having purchased the rights to "Janet and John" from Nisbet and Co, Star Kids Ltd published an updated series of 33 volumes in 2001 covering reading, writing and mathematics for children aged four to seven. While the names Janet and John were retained, the text and illustrations were updated to include characters from different ethnic backgrounds and from non-nuclear families. The series attracted some criticism from those who disapproved of its disregard of phonics in favour of "look and say".
Summersdale reprints.
In 2007, as part of a trend in publishing nostalgic facsimiles of old favourites, Summersdale Publishers reissued two of the original "Janet and John" books, "Here We Go" and "Off to Play".
Later critical responses.
After the books fell out of fashion they became a target for ridicule on the basis of their stilted diction and overwhelmingly middle-class content. The radio broadcaster Terry Wogan regularly satirised the books on his BBC Radio 2 show "Wake Up To Wogan" by reading out stories featuring an adult Janet and John in the style of the original, deriving humour through euphemism and innuendo.

TP Mazembe

Tout Puissant Mazembe, commonly referred to as TP Mazembe, is a Congolese professional football club based in Lubumbashi. They were vice-world champion laureates, losing 3-0 against Internazionale in the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup edition.
History.
Tout Puissant Mazembe, the first sports club from the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a value of at least $10 million, was originally founded by the Benedictine monks who directed the Institut Saint-Boniface school in Élisabethville (modern-day Lubumbashi) in Katanga Province. The missionaries originally decided in 1939 to established a football team for the students' Boy Scout troop, named Saint Georges FC, after the patron saint of the Scouting movement. This team affiliated itself directly in the first division of the Royal Federation of the Native Athletic Associations ("Fédération Royale des Associations Sportives Indigènes", FRASI) founded by the Belgian King. At the end of the season, Holy Georges placed 3rd.
In 1944 the young scouts went on the road and FC St. Georges was rechristened Saint Paul F.C. Some years later, the incorporation of certain foreign elements in the Institute would make the missionaries abandon the team management. The team took the name of F.C. Englebert after its sponsor, a tire brand. The qualifier "Tout Puissant" (Almighty) was added to the club's name after it went undefeated in winning its first league title in 1966.
After the independence of Congo, (30 June 1960) Englebert restructured itself. In 1966, they realized the treble (national Championship, Coupe du Congo and Katanga Cup).
In 1967 and 1968, they won the African Cup of Champions. The team would be finalist four consecutive times from 1967 to 1970. Mazembe was the first team to successfully defend the African Champions Cup. This feat was finally repeated in 2003 and 2004 by Enyimba.
After 18 years of absence, it returned to the African scene thanks to 38-year-old governor Moïse Katumbi Chapwe and owner of the club.
In November 2009 the team won the CAF Champions League, the African championship for football clubs. Mazembe won against Heartland 2–2 on aggregate, winning on the away goals rule.
By winning the CAF Champions League, Mazembe qualified for the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup. In their first world championship match in the quarter-finals they lost 2–1 to the Pohang Steelers from South Korea, despite taking the lead in the first half. Following a 3–2 defeat to Auckland City in the fifth placed match they finished the tournament in 6th place.
In 2010 they retained the 2010 CAF Champions League, and in December they became the first African side (and first from outside Europe and South America, in general) to contest the final of the FIFA Club World Cup after defeating both Pachuca of Mexico 1–0 in the quarter-finals and Internacional of Brazil 2–0 in the semi-finals.
In the final on 18 December, they were defeated 3–0 by Internazionale.
In 2015, TP Mazembe secured their fifth title in the competition after defeating USM Alger of Algeria 4–1 aggregate in the 2015 CAF Champions League final.
Women's football.
In 2020, a women's section of TP Mazembe was formed.
Honours.
With 28 titles at national level and 11 at international level since 1966, TP Mazembe is currently the most successful club of the DRC with 39 titles.
Performance in CAF competitions.
The club have 7 appearances in African Cup of Champions Clubs from 1967 to 1988 and 18 appearances in CAF Champions League from 2001 till now, having appeared in every edition since 2007.

Phormium colensoi

Phormium colensoi (syn. "Phormium cookianum" – see below), also called mountain flax, or in Māori, is a perennial plant that is endemic to New Zealand. The greenish, yellow or orange flowers are followed by twisted seed pods. It is less common than the other "Phormium" species, "P. tenax" or . Mountain flax is also known as , , , (Williams 1971), (Bell 1890 sic.), coastal flax, hill flax and lesser New Zealand flax.
Description.
The leaves are under 2 metres in length while those of "P. tenax" range from 1 to 3 metres in length. The scape is much shorter than that of "P. tenax", rising up to 2 metres in height while that of "P. tenax" is around 5 metres in height. The colour of the inner tepals is green while the outer tepals are yellow to red. In contrast the tepals of "P. tenax" are a dull red, with the tips of the inner tepals being less strongly recurved. The capsules of "P. colensoi", unlike those of "P. tenax" are twisted and pendulous, and may be twice as long (up to 20 cm in length). The numerous seeds in each pod are glossy black, flat and elongated with a frilled margin 
"Phormium colensoi" has two distinct geographic forms, one occurring in lowland parts of the North Island, and the other in the southern and mountainous areas of the South Island as well as ranges in the North Island. The lowland form has green or yellow tepals and the mountain form has red tepals. In the Cook Strait area, both forms and intermediates can be found.
Taxonomy.
The species was originally mentioned without description by William Colenso, the name being given as "Phormium forsterianum". It was later known as "P. colensoi", a name that was listed without description in 1846 by Joseph Dalton Hooker. The name became better known from J. D. Hooker's 1864 publication in "Handbook of the New Zealand Flora". However, previously, in 1848, Auguste François Le Jolis had described the species under the name "P. cookianum", and for many years this name was thought to have priority over Hooker's name "P. colensoi". The latter is now regarded as the accepted name by some, based on a brief description of the species in a quotation from J.D. Hooker in an article by Auguste Le Jolis in the "Revue Horticole" of 1 January 1848. Another specimen, believed to be identical to a plant found by Ronald Gunn at the Whanganui River in 1864, was described from a plant growing in a garden in Torquay, England in 1888 and given the name "P. hookeri" (later reduced to a subspecies under the name "P. cookianum" subsp. "hookeri"). This name is also now regarded as a synonym of "P. colensoi" by some. "Phormium cookianum", however, is still the preferred name in Aotearoa New Zealand according to Ngā Tipu Aotearoa and The Flora of New Zealand, as studies of the complex morphological and genetic variation as well as hybridization, and hence taxonomy, of the genus are still underway.
Uses.
Wharariki is a taonga (sacred, treasure) species to Māori and numerous traditional cultivars have been used for various purposes. Refer to Ngā Tipu Whakaoranga [Māōri Plant Use Database] and the citations within and Te Kohinga Harakeke o Aotearoa – National New Zealand Flax Collection.
Cultivars.
Numerous cultivars of this species have been selected for cultivation (those marked have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit): 
There is also a dwarf cultivar, and hybrid cultivars have been selected from crosses with "Phormium tenax". "P. colensoi" cultivars are regarded as less hardy than other "Phormium" cultivars.

Brampton Bryan

Brampton Bryan is a small village and civil parish situated in north Herefordshire, England close to the Shropshire and Welsh borders.
Brampton Bryan lies midway between Leintwardine and Knighton on the A4113 road. The nearest station is Bucknell railway station on the Heart of Wales Line. The village has had a complex history and its buildings reflect this. Much of Brampton Bryan is owned by the estate of the Harley family who have controlled the area since the early fourteenth century. They succeeded the powerful Mortimer family.
As well as the main village, the parish contains the hamlets of Boresford and Pedwardine.
Buildings.
The ruins of Brampton Bryan Castle are on a floodplain south of the River Teme, north of the church. From this site the castle guarded an important route from Ludlow along the Teme Valley to Knighton and on into Central Wales. The area has been important since Roman times and the village is a few miles west of Leintwardine - an important Roman site.
The current buildings include the ruined earthwork and buried remains of the quadrangular castle. The medieval layout consisted of four ranges built around a courtyard, with a gatehouse contained within the southern curtain wall, to which a large outer gatehouse was added. The whole was constructed on a motte and surrounded by a moat, with the approach to the castle being from the south across a bridge to the gatehouse.
The north range contained the hall and service bay, both at first floor level, with the kitchen to the east. Private accommodation was found in the other ranges, with further chambers above the gate passage of the inner gatehouse and on the first floor of the outer gatehouse. The current house was built following the English Civil War and is largely eighteenth century.
St Barnabas Church was built in 1656, during the period of the Commonwealth. It replaces an earlier building that was destroyed during the siege of Brampton Bryan castle in 1643. Whilst from the outside the church has a considerable appeal, once entered the effect is unnerving due to its breadth being entirely out of proportion to its length. Its nave and chancel are one and covered by a very fine double hammerbeam roof. It was thought that the roof may well have been constructed from the ruins of the castle, but recent research as part of the Heritage Lottery bid has tended to rule that possibility out. It contains an early 14th-century monument to Lady Margaret de Brampton, who is shown holding her heart in her hands. It is a Grade I listed building. For more details see the Wigmore Abbey site. Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, statesman of the late Stuart and early Georgian periods, is buried in the churchyard. The church is on Historic England's list of buildings at risk.
Other buildings within the village include a number of fine Georgian houses and some earlier timber-framed buildings situated around the small triangular green. Parson's Pole Bridge is situated in the civil parish and takes the lane from Brampton Bryan to the hamlets of Buckton and Coxall across the River Teme.
History.
The village is mentioned in the Domesday Survey when it formed part of the estate of Ralph de Mortimer although evidence of occupation extends back to at least Roman times, as the remains of a temporary marching camp lie near the village.
The name means 'Broom farm/settlement'. 'Bryan' probably refers to one Brian Unspac.
During the First English Civil War, Brampton Bryan Castle was held for Parliament by Lady Brilliana Harley during the first of two sieges. The first siege started on 26 July 1643 when Royalists surrounded Brampton Bryan. Although the village was put to the torch (the church, the parsonage, 40 houses and the castle mills were all burnt down), and the castle left without a roof, the Royalists failed to capture the castle, ending the siege on 9 September. Lady Brilliana died later that year, probably due to ill health brought on by the siege. In the spring of 1644, the Royalists began a new siege that lasted for three weeks. This time the castle defences were so weakened by undermining and battering by artillery, that the Parliamentary governor surrendered the castle. It was then sacked and burnt, while the garrison was sent to be imprisoned in Royalist-controlled Shrewsbury.
There was also a castle in Pedwardine, south of the main village, that belonged to the Hay family.
Today.
Today the village in addition to its church possesses a tearoom and a large bookshop, "Aardvark Books", which sells over 50,000 titles, and a remarkable and ancient yew hedge.
The Herefordshire Trail long-distance footpath passes through the village.

Lucy Cavendish

Lucy Caroline Cavendish (; 5 September 1841 – 22 April 1925), also known as Lady Frederick Cavendish, was an English pioneer of women's education.
A daughter of George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton, she married into another aristocratic family, the Cavendishes, in 1864. Eighteen years later her husband, Lord Frederick Cavendish, was murdered in Dublin by Irish republicans (a victim of the Phoenix Park murders). After his death she devoted much of her time to the cause of girls' and women's education, for which she was honoured in her lifetime with an honorary degree, and posthumously when, in 1965, the University of Cambridge named its first postgraduate college for women after her.
Biography.
Lucy Lyttelton was born at Hagley Hall in Worcestershire, the second daughter of George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton, and his wife, Mary Glynne, whose sister Catherine married William Ewart Gladstone. In 1863 she was appointed a Maid of Honour to Queen Victoria, whom she attended until her marriage the following year.
Marriage and husband's murder.
On 7 June 1864 she married Lord Frederick Cavendish, the second son of the Duke of Devonshire. They had no children. Cavendish was elected to Parliament in 1865. In the same year she was excited to join the Ladies Diocesan Association run by Catharine Tait with the prospect of visiting workhouses to try to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor.
Her husband was murdered by Irish republicans on 6 May 1882, the same day he took the oath of office of Chief Secretary for Ireland. Although devastated by the assassination, on the day before the ringleader was hanged she sent him the small gold crucifix she had long worn, as a token of her forgiveness. Gladstone was greatly moved when she told him that she could bear the loss of her beloved husband "if his death were to work good to his fellow-men, which indeed was the whole object of his life." She remained a firm supporter of Irish Home Rule. A window to Lord Frederick's memory was placed in St Margaret's Church, Westminster, at the expense of the members of the House of Commons.
Later years.
After Cavendish's death, Lucy Cavendish was active in the sphere of women's education. She was President of the Yorkshire Ladies Council of Education from 1883 to 1912. She declined the offer of the post of Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge, in 1884. She was a member of the Royal Commission on Secondary Education and was a founding member of the Council of the Girls' Public Day School Company, which had been founded by her father. On 6 October 1904 she received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws at the formal inauguration of Leeds University for "notable service to the cause of education".
Death.
Lucy Cavendish died on 22 April 1925, aged 83, in her home, the Glebe, in Penshurst, Kent. She was buried with her husband in the Cavendish family churchyard, St Peter's.
Legacy.
Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, was named in her honour in 1965. She was the great-aunt of one of its founders, Margaret Braithwaite.

William Randell

William Richard Randell "Captain Randell" (2 May 1824 – 4 March 1911), was an Australian politician and pioneer born in Devon, England, who emigrated to the newly founded colony of South Australia in 1837 with his family. He was a pioneer of the riverboat industry on the River Murray and represented the Electoral district of Gumeracha in the South Australian House of Assembly from 1893 to 1899.
Captain Randell can also refer to his son (Richard) Murray Randell (2 February 1863 – 6 March 1952), who took over management of his father's small fleet of River Murray paddle steamers.
Early years.
Born the eldest son of William Beavis Randell (1799–1876), a miller of Sidbury, Devon, and Mary Ann Elliott Randell (née Beare) (1799 – 22 December 1874), William was educated in Exeter. The family emigrated to Adelaide in 1837 on the "Hartley", probably on the recommendation of family friend George Fife Angas, arriving at Holdfast Bay on 20 October 1837. His father was appointed as Stock Manager for the South Australian Company, and was to have overseen erection and operation of its steam-driven flour mill, but though the mill machinery and building materials arrived shortly after the "Hartley", it was stranded on Kangaroo Island and did not arrive on the mainland for some time. The family first lived in a large tent rented from Robert Gouger then in 1839 moved into "Park Cottage" of 11 rooms on the banks of the Torrens, (demolished ) on section 256, the site of the present Adelaide Caravan Park. The mill (1842–1872) was built where Hackney Hotel is now. In 1840 W. B. Randell purchased 566 acres as a "Special Survey", then another tranche, totalling 966 acres which he called "Kenton Park" (probably named for Kenton, Devon). He completed a home in 1844, and "Kenton Mill" which commenced operation in 1848, with William Richard Randell its first manager. In 1852 he laid out the town of Gumeracha above the flood level of Kenton Creek.
Family of W. B. Randell.
William Beavis Randell (originally "Randle") married Mary Ann Elliott Beare (or Bear) (1799–1874) on 17 April 1823. They had 9 children:
The "Mary Ann".
As well as his mill management duties, William Randell assisted his father and brothers with their vast property which stretched from present-day Gumeracha to the River Murray. His duties often involved droving cattle to the banks of the lower Murray, and dreamt of steam-boats being able to transport produce between South Australia and the neighbouring colony of Victoria. At the time South Australia was struggling to retain its population due to emigration to the Victorian goldfields.
In 1852, with no experience in the steamboat construction, Randell commissioned local carpenters to build the frame of a , paddlewheel boat of shallow draught, capacity 20 ton in Gumeracha. It was dismantled, taken by bullock cart across the plains to Reedy Creek Station and the Noa No landing about 2 miles north of the present Mannum. There it was rebuilt, clad in local redgum. Named the "Mary Ann", after his mother, the steamer featured a cylinder beam-engine delivering 8 horsepower, made by a German engineer from Adelaide, Carl Gehlkin. The boiler was an unsatisfactory rectangular affair built by the Randells' blacksmith. Its first trip, of 24 miles, was made on 19 February 1853. On 4 March she arrived at Goolwa for her first official voyage and received in grand style by the lieutenant-governor Sir Henry Young and hundreds of others. He set off on the return trip that afternoon. On 25 March 1853 he had navigated to Penn's Reach, a few miles north of Morgan, when low water levels forced him to return. The following year he reached Swan Hill, from the sea at Goolwa. Later that year Captain Cadell won the Government's £2000 prize for the first practicable cargo boat "Lady Augusta" (The £2,000 was soon raised to £4,000 on Cadell's agreement to build another boat. By the terms of the contest, the "Mary Ann" was never a contender for the prize.)
The "Mary Ann" was later rebuilt as one half of a two-hulled vessel named "Gemini".
Expansion.
Randell abandoned Noa No as too subject to flooding and built a small "pug and pine" cottage, the start of the town of Mannum, and a dry-dock.
His second boat, the twin-hulled single paddle-wheel "Gemini", despite its small size and ungainly appearance, managed some feats of navigation into New South Wales. She reached Lang's Crossing (where Hay stands now), then Brewarrina in 1859, and on another occasion as far as Walgett.
Randell built (or commissioned) many more steamers: "Bogan", "Bunyip" (destroyed by fire in 1863, along with its barges), "Ariel", "Nil Desperandum", "Corowa", "Waragery", "Tyro", and "Ruby". Wentworth, New South Wales was Randell's base for two decades until the 1870s, as he supervised the expansion of his fleet and the burgeoning of trade on the Murray-Darling.
Randell built a residence "Bleak House", a floating dock, wharf and warehouse at Mannum. At its peak around 1860, there would be 20,000 bales of wool unloaded at Mannum and driven by horse teams to Port Adelaide.
Randell served as a Justice of the Peace from 1861 in New South Wales, and from 1873 in South Australia. With the death of his father in 1876, Randell returned to Gumeracha and had little more to do with the river trade. His son (Richard) Murray Randell took over the fleet and the title "Captain Randell".
Politics and last days.
Randell represented Gumeracha in the South Australian House of Assembly from 1893 to 1899; while the oldest member of the house he regularly made the trip between his constituency and Parliament House in Adelaide.
Randell moved to North Adelaide in 1910 and died on 4 March 1911. He was survived by five sons and four daughters.
Place in history.
A. T. Saunders, more perhaps than any other historian, was scathing in his denunciation of Cadell, comparing his achievements unfavourably with those of Randell in scathing terms. Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, previously Governor of South Australia, in a lecture entitled "Australia: What it is and what it may be", delivered at the Metropolitan Hall, Dublin, on 7 May 1863, was more temperate:
Family.
William Randell married Elizabeth Ann "Annie" Nickels (1835 – 17 October 1924) on 24 December 1853. Their children included:

Camilo Carreón (August 6, 1937 – September 2, 1987) was an American professional baseball player. The catcher appeared in 354 games over all or parts of eight Major League Baseball seasons between and for the Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians and Baltimore Orioles. His son Mark was also a major league player. Born in Colton, California, Camilo Carreón threw and batted right-handed, and was listed as tall and .
Playing career.
White Sox.
Signed by the White Sox in 1956, Carreón rose steadily through their farm system, hitting over .300 at three different levels, including .311 in 1959 with Indianapolis in the Triple-A American Association, with 165 hits and 91 runs batted in. He was named the Association's All-Star catcher. Carreón made his major league debut on September 27, 1959, the closing day of Chicago's pennant-winning season. He hit a fly ball out against Pete Burnside of the Detroit Tigers in his only at bat. He was late reporting to Sarasota, Florida, for spring training in 1960 because of service in the U.S. Army, then spent the bulk of the campaign back in Triple-A, this time with San Diego of the Pacific Coast League, and hit .279 in 109 games. He then received his second consecutive September call-up, batting .235 in eight games, including seven starts as catcher.
Carreón made the White Sox for good in , getting into 78 games, with 63 starts at catcher in relief of 37-year-old veteran star Sherm Lollar. He hit a two-run single off Whitey Ford to give Juan Pizarro a 2–1 victory over the New York Yankees on August 15, 1961. The second-inning hit enabled the White Sox to break Ford's 14-game winning streak. Overall, he hit .271 in his first full MLB season. The next year, , he supplanted Lollar as the White Sox' regular catcher, starting 85 games and hitting .256. His best big-league season came in , when he played in 101 games and hit .274, starting 81 games behind the plate. It was his last full and healthy season in the majors.
Indians and Orioles.
The White Sox placed Carreón on the disabled list on July 3, 1964, after he tore tendons in his right arm. During the 1964–65 offseason, Chicago traded him to the Cleveland Indians as part of a blockbuster three-way trade involving the Kansas City Athletics that also included Rocky Colavito, Tommy John and Tommie Agee. Going into the campaign, Carreón was listed as the Indians' second-string catcher, behind Joe Azcue. But he played only 19 games with the Tribe, spent 45 games back in Triple-A with Portland of the Pacific Coast League, and was one of five players assigned outright to Portland in October 1965. Carreón was traded from the Indians to the Orioles for Lou Piniella and $25,000 on 10 March 1966. The Orioles were en route to their first-ever American League pennant that season, but Carreón got into only four games for Baltimore (his last on June 8, when he hit a double in his final MLB at bat), and spent the latter half of the year with Triple-A Rochester. He played two more minor league seasons before retiring from baseball.
As a major leaguer, Carreón collected 260 hits, including 43 doubles, four triples, and 11 home runs, with 114 runs batted in. He batted .264 lifetime. Defensively, he recorded a .993 fielding percentage as a catcher, committing only 13 errors in 1,776 total chances. He died in Tucson, Arizona, at the age of 50, and is buried in the Hermosa Memorial Cemetery in Colton.

Bittereinder

The Bittereinders () or irreconcilables were a faction of Boer guerrilla fighters, resisting the forces of the British Empire in the later stages of the Second Boer War (1899–1902).
By September 1900, the conventional forces of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State had been largely defeated by the British army. The remnants of Boer government resolved to fight on in a guerrilla war, to try to force the British to retreat from the territory. As it became clear that military victory was unlikely, opinion among the guerrillas divided between those who wanted to secure a negotiated peace and those who preferred to fight on to "the bitter end" (). The decision to continue the fight was given particular motivation by the British use of concentration camps to intern captured Boers.
Taken more generally, it could be used as another name for a "war party" (a faction within a political or military group favouring the waging of war) or for any group which does not wish to diminish its "fighting spirit" wanting to fight it out to the "bitter end".

Recorder of London

The recorder of London is an ancient legal office in the City of London. The recorder of London is the senior circuit judge at the Central Criminal Court (the Old Bailey), hearing trials of criminal offences. The recorder is appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the City of London Corporation with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor. The recorder's deputy is the Common Serjeant of London, appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor. The recorder of London is, since 14 April 2020, Mark Lucraft.
Background.
The first recorder of London was appointed in 1298. Originally it seems likely that the recorder would have recorded pleas in the court of the Lord Mayor and the aldermen and delivered their judgments. A charter granted by Henry VI in 1444 appointed the recorder "ex officio" a conservator of the peace. The recorder increasingly exercised judicial functions thereafter, eventually becoming the principal judge in the City of London.
The recorder became a judge at the Central Criminal Court when it was created by Parliament in 1834. The Central Criminal Court became part of the Crown Court under the Courts Act 1971, but the recorder maintained their position when the office of recorder in other cities became honorary.
Functions.
In addition to hearing criminal trials at the Central Criminal Court, the recorder of London heads up court list management (including allocation of cases) to the court's judges. The recorder also provides legal advice to the Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen. Historically, the Recorder would present a list of 'Capital Convicts', those sentenced to death to the 'Hanging Cabinet' constituting the monarch, Home Secretary and other ministers, but this function was stopped between 1837 and the end of the death penalty.
The recorder has a traditional dress and takes charge of the election of the Lord Mayor of London, declares the result, and physically presents the new Lord Mayor for the monarch's approval, first to the Lord Chancellor, and then to the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls (at the Royal Courts of Justice on the day of the Lord Mayor's Show). On the occasion of a state visit, the recorder usually presents an Address of Welcome on behalf of the City.
The recorder of London is the returning officer at the election of the verderers of Epping Forest, and is usually appointed High Steward of Southwark, appointed by the Court of Aldermen, holding the sitting of the three courts leet of the City's (largely ceremonial) manors there each year.
The recorder can act as the deputy of the Common Serjeant in the election of the Sheriff and their presentation to the King's Remembrancer at the Quit Rent ceremony.

Medieval cuisine

Medieval cuisine includes foods, eating habits, and cooking methods of various European cultures during the Middle Ages, which lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. During this period, diets and cooking changed less than they did in the early modern period that followed, when those changes helped lay the foundations for modern European cuisines.
Cereals remained the most important staple during the Early Middle Ages as rice was introduced to Europe late, with the potato first used in the 16th century, and much later for the wider population. Barley, oats, and rye were eaten by the poor while wheat was generally more expensive. These were consumed as bread, porridge, gruel, and pasta by people of all classes. Cheese, fruits, and vegetables were important supplements for the lower orders while meat was more expensive and generally more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken, and other poultry. Beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. A wide variety of freshwater and saltwater fish were also eaten, with cod and herring being mainstays among the northern populations.
Slow and inefficient transports made long-distance trade of many foods very expensive (perishability made other foods untransportable). Because of this, the nobility's food was more prone to foreign influence than the cuisine of the poor; it was dependent on exotic spices and expensive imports. As each level of society attempted to imitate the one above it, innovations from international trade and foreign wars from the 12th century onward gradually disseminated through the upper middle class of medieval cities. Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes and sumptuary laws limited conspicuous consumption among the nouveau riche. Social norms also dictated that the food of the working class be less refined, since it was believed there was a natural resemblance between one's way of life and one's food; hard manual labor required coarser, cheaper food.
A type of refined cooking that developed in the Late Middle Ages set the standard among the nobility all over Europe. Common seasonings in the highly spiced sweet-sour repertory typical of upper-class medieval food included verjuice, wine, and vinegar in combination with spices such as black pepper, saffron, and ginger. These, along with the widespread use of honey or sugar, gave many dishes a sweet-sour flavor. Almonds were very popular as a thickener in soups, stews, and sauces, particularly as almond milk.
Dietary norms.
The cuisines of the cultures of the Mediterranean Basin since antiquity had been based on cereals, particularly various types of wheat. Porridge, gruel, and later bread became the basic staple foods that made up the majority of calorie intake for most of the population. From the 8th to the 11th centuries, the proportion of various cereals in the diet rose from about a third to three-quarters. Dependence on wheat remained significant throughout the medieval era, and spread northward with the rise of Christianity. In colder climates, however, it was usually unaffordable for the majority population, and was associated with the higher classes. The centrality of bread in religious rituals such as the Eucharist meant that it enjoyed an especially high prestige among foodstuffs. Only olive oil and wine had a comparable value, but both remained quite exclusive outside the warmer grape- and olive-growing regions. The symbolic role of bread as both sustenance and substance is illustrated in a sermon given by Saint Augustine:
The growing presence of Islam in the medieval period defined a shift in both the religious attitudes of Europeans and their perspectives on cuisine. As the Mediterranean became increasingly symbolic of a religious divide between European Christianity and Islam, tensions placed significance on symbolic dietary practices. The religious connotations of bread and wine in Christianity opposed the dietary restrictions on alcohol and the differences in the bread-making practices pertinent to Islamic cuisine. Thus, the consumption of bread and wine spread northward from the Mediterranean region in part as a means of Christian opposition. Additionally, pork was reinforced in European cuisine as a product of importance and value, differing from the Islamic dietary restrictions on pork consumption. However, these divergences did not prohibit the exchange of flavors and goods from occurring between Islamic regions and Europe.
After the Bubonic Plague in 1347-1352, dietary norms changed drastically due to different food resources available in Europe. Since the population in Europe significantly dipped, farm land and livestock was left mostly unattended and uncared for. Availability of wheat and oats, popular foods before the Bubonic Plague, started declining. Evidence from bone collagen samples suggest that after the Bubonic Plague, Europeans consumed more animal protein such as beef, goats, chicken, sheep and pork rather than cereal and grains.
Class constraints.
Medieval society was highly stratified. In a time when famine was commonplace and social hierarchies were often brutally enforced, food was an important marker of social status in a way that has no equivalent today in most developed countries. According to the ideological norm, society consisted of the three estates of the realm: commoners, that is, the working classes—by far the largest group; the clergy, and the nobility. The relationship between the classes was strictly hierarchical, with the nobility and clergy claiming worldly and spiritual overlordship over commoners. Within the nobility and clergy there were also a number of ranks ranging from kings and popes to dukes, bishops and their subordinates, such as squires and priests. One was expected to remain in one's social class and to respect the authority of the ruling classes. Political power was displayed not just by rule, but also by displaying wealth. Refined nobles dined on fresh game seasoned with exotic spices, and displayed refined table manners. Rough laborers could make do with coarse barley bread, salt pork and beans and were not expected to display etiquette. Even dietary recommendations were different: the diet of the upper classes was considered to be as much a requirement of their refined physical constitution as a sign of economic reality. The digestive system of a lord was considered to be more refined than that of lower-class subordinates and therefore required finer foods.
In the late Middle Ages, the increasing wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy. This threatened to break down some of the symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets. Animal parts were even assigned to different social classes.
The Church.
The Catholic and Orthodox Churches, and their calendars, had great influence on eating habits; consumption of meat was forbidden for a full third of the year for most Christians. All animal products, including eggs and dairy products (during the strictest fasting periods also fish), were generally prohibited during Lent and fast. Additionally, it was customary for all citizens to fast before taking the Eucharist. These fasts were occasionally for a full day and required total abstinence.
Both the Eastern and the Western churches ordained that feast should alternate with fast. In most of Europe, Fridays were fast days, and fasting was observed on various other days and periods, including Lent and Advent. Meat, and animal products such as milk, cheese, butter, and eggs, were not allowed, and at times also fish. The fast was intended to mortify the body and invigorate the soul, and also to remind the faster of Christ's sacrifice for humanity. The intention was not to portray certain foods as unclean, but rather to teach a spiritual lesson in self-restraint through abstention. During particularly severe fast days, the number of daily meals was also reduced to one. Even if most people respected these restrictions and usually made penance when they violated them, there were also numerous ways of circumventing them, a conflict of ideals and practice summarized by writer Bridget Ann Henisch:
While animal products were to be avoided during times of penance, pragmatic compromises often prevailed. The definition of "fish" was often extended to marine and semi-aquatic animals such as whales, barnacle geese, puffins, and even beavers. The choice of ingredients may have been limited, but that did not mean that meals were smaller. Neither were there any restrictions against (moderate) drinking or eating sweets. Banquets held on fish days could be splendid, and were popular occasions for serving illusion food that imitated meat, cheese, and eggs in various ingenious ways; fish could be moulded to look like venison and fake eggs could be made by stuffing empty egg shells with fish roe and almond milk and cooking them in coals. While Byzantine church officials took a hard-line approach, and discouraged any culinary refinement for the clergy, their Western counterparts were far more lenient. There was also no lack of grumbling about the rigours of fasting among the laity. During Lent, kings and schoolboys, commoners and nobility, all complained about being deprived of meat for the long, hard weeks of solemn contemplation of their sins. At Lent, owners of livestock were even warned to keep an eye out for hungry dogs frustrated by a "hard siege by Lent and fish bones".
The trend from the 13th century onward was toward a more legalistic interpretation of fasting. Nobles were careful not to eat meat on fast days, but still dined in style; fish replaced meat, often as imitation hams and bacon; almond milk replaced animal milk as an expensive non-dairy alternative; faux eggs made from almond milk were cooked in blown-out eggshells, flavoured and coloured with exclusive spices. In some cases, the lavishness of noble tables was outdone by Benedictine monasteries, which served as many as sixteen courses during certain feast days. Exceptions from fasting were frequently made for very broadly defined groups. Thomas Aquinas (about 1225–1274) believed dispensation should be provided for children, the old, pilgrims, workers and beggars, but not the poor as long as they had some sort of shelter. There are many accounts of members of monastic orders who flouted fasting restrictions through clever interpretations of the Bible. Since the sick were exempt from fasting, there often evolved the notion that fasting restrictions only applied to the main dining area, and many Benedictine friars would simply eat their fast day meals in what was called the misericord (at those times) rather than the refectory. Newly-assigned Catholic monastery officials sought to amend the problem of fast evasion not merely with moral condemnations, but by making sure that well-prepared non-meat dishes were available on fast days.
Dietetics.
Medical science of the Middle Ages had a considerable influence on what was considered healthy and nutritious among the upper classes. One's lifestyle—including diet, exercise, appropriate social behavior, and approved medical remedies—was the way to good health, and all types of food were assigned certain properties that affected a person's health. All foodstuffs were also classified on scales ranging from hot to cold and moist to dry, according to the four bodily humours theory proposed by Galen that dominated Western medical science from late Antiquity and throughout the Middle Ages.
Medieval scholars considered human digestion to be a process similar to cooking. The processing of food in the stomach was seen as a continuation of the preparation initiated by the cook. In order for the food to be properly "cooked" and for the nutrients to be properly absorbed, it was important that the stomach be filled in an appropriate manner. Easily digestible foods would be consumed first, followed by gradually heavier dishes. If this regimen were not respected, it was believed that heavy foods would sink to the bottom of the stomach, thus blocking the digestion duct; as such, food would digest very slowly and cause putrefaction of the body and draw bad humours into the stomach. It was also of vital importance that food of differing properties not be mixed.
Before a meal, the stomach would preferably be "opened" with an apéritif (from Latin , 'to open') that was preferably of a hot and dry nature: confections made from honey- or sugar-coated spices like ginger, caraway, and seeds of anise, fennel, or cumin, wine and sweetened fortified milk drinks. As the stomach had been opened, it should then be "closed" at the end of the meal with the help of a digestive, most commonly a dragée, which during the Middle Ages consisted of lumps of spiced sugar, or hypocras, a wine flavoured with fragrant spices, along with aged cheese. A meal would ideally begin with easily digestible fruit, such as apples. It would then be followed by vegetables such as cabbage, lettuce, purslane, herbs, moist fruits, and light meats, such as chicken or kid, with pottages and broths. After that came the "heavy" meats, such as pork and beef, as well as vegetables and nuts, including pears and chestnuts, both considered difficult to digest. It was popular, and recommended by medical expertise, to finish the meal with aged cheese and various digestives.
The most ideal food was that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. moderately warm and moist. Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained to achieve a true mixture of all the ingredients. White wine was believed to be cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.
Calorie structure.
The calorie content and structure of medieval diet varied over time, from region to region, and between classes. However, for most people, the diet tended to be high-carbohydrate, with most of the budget spent on, and the majority of calories provided by, cereals and alcohol (such as beer). Even though meat was highly valued by all, lower classes often could not afford it, nor were they allowed by the church to consume it every day. In England in the 13th century, meat contributed a negligible portion of calories to a typical harvest worker's diet; however, its share increased after the Black Death and, by the 15th century, it provided about 20% of the total. Even among the lay nobility of medieval England, grain provided 65–70% of calories in the early 14th century, though a generous provision of meat and fish was included, and their consumption of meat increased in the aftermath of the Black Death as well. In one early-15th-century English aristocratic household for which detailed records are available (that of the Earl of Warwick), gentle members of the household received a staggering of assorted meats in a typical meat meal in the autumn and in the winter, in addition to of bread and of beer or possibly wine (and there would have been two meat meals per day, five days a week, except during Lent). In the household of Henry Stafford in 1469, gentle members received of meat per meal, and all others received , and everyone was given of bread and of alcohol. On top of these quantities, some members of these households (usually, a minority) ate breakfast, which would not include any meat, but would probably include another of beer; and uncertain quantities of bread and ale could have been consumed in between meals. The diet of the lord of the household differed somewhat from this structure, including less red meat, more high-quality wild game, fresh fish, fruit, and wine.
In monasteries, the basic structure of the diet was laid down by the Rule of Saint Benedict in the 7th century and tightened by Pope Benedict XII in 1336, but (as mentioned above) monks were adept at "working around" these rules. Wine was restricted to about per day, but there was no corresponding limit on beer, and, at Westminster Abbey, each monk was given an allowance of of beer per day. Meat of "four-footed animals" was prohibited altogether, year-round, for everyone but the very weak and the sick. This was circumvented in part by declaring that offal, and various processed foods such as bacon, were not meat. Secondly, Benedictine monasteries contained a room called the misericord, where the Rule of Saint Benedict did not apply, and where a large number of monks ate. Each monk would be regularly sent either to the misericord or to the refectory. When Pope Benedict XII ruled that at least half of all monks should be required to eat in the refectory on any given day, monks responded by excluding the sick and those invited to the abbot's table from the reckoning. Overall, a monk at Westminster Abbey in the late 15th century would have been allowed of bread per day; 5 eggs per day, except on Fridays and in Lent; of meat per day, four days per week (excluding Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday), except in Advent and Lent; and of fish per day, three days per week and every day during Advent and Lent.
The overall calorie intake is subject to some debate. One typical estimate is that an adult peasant male needed per day, and an adult female needed . Both lower and higher estimates have been proposed. Those engaged in particularly heavy physical labor, as well as sailors and soldiers, may have consumed or more per day. Intakes of aristocrats may have reached per day. Monks consumed per day on "normal" days, and per day when fasting. As a consequence of these excesses, obesity was common among upper classes. Monks, especially, frequently suffered from conditions that were more common among the obese, such as arthritis.
Regional variation.
The regional specialties that are a feature of early modern and contemporary cuisine were not in evidence in the sparser documentation that survives. Instead, medieval cuisine can be differentiated by the cereals and the oils that shaped dietary norms and crossed ethnic and, later, national boundaries. Geographical variation in eating was primarily the result of differences in climate, political administration, and local customs that varied across the continent. Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned. In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic, the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation of grapes and olives. In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually had to settle for cheap second-pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import. Citrus fruits (though not the kinds most common today) and pomegranates were common around the Mediterranean. Dried figs and dates were available in the north, but were used rather sparingly in cooking.
Olive oil was a ubiquitous ingredient in Mediterranean cultures, but remained an expensive import in the north where oils of poppy, walnut, hazel, and filbert were the most affordable alternatives. Butter and lard, especially after the terrible mortality during the Black Death made them less scarce, were used in considerable quantities in the northern and northwestern regions, especially in the Low Countries. Almost universal in middle and upper class cooking all over Europe was the almond, which was in the ubiquitous and highly versatile almond milk, which was used as a substitute in dishes that otherwise required eggs or milk, though the bitter variety of almonds came along much later.
Meals.
In Europe, there were typically two meals a day: dinner at mid-day and a lighter supper in the evening. The two-meal system remained consistent throughout the late Middle Ages. Smaller intermediate meals were common, but became a matter of social status, as those who did not have to perform manual labor could go without them. Moralists frowned on breaking the overnight fast too early, and members of the church and cultivated gentry avoided it. For practical reasons, breakfast was still eaten by working men, and was tolerated for young children, women, the elderly and the sick. Because the church preached against gluttony and other weaknesses of the flesh, men tended to be ashamed of the weak practicality of breakfast. Lavish dinner banquets and late-night "reresopers" (from Occitan "rèire-sopar", "late supper") with considerable alcoholic beverage consumption were considered immoral. The latter were especially associated with gambling, crude language, drunkenness, and lewd behavior. Minor meals and snacks were common (although also disliked by the church), and working men commonly received an allowance from their employers in order to buy "nuncheons", small morsels to be eaten during breaks.
Etiquette.
As with almost every part of life at the time, a medieval meal was generally a communal affair. The entire household, including servants, would ideally dine together. To sneak off to enjoy private company was considered a haughty and inefficient egotism in a world where people depended very much on each other. In the 13th century, English bishop Robert Grosseteste advised the Countess of Lincoln: "forbid dinners and suppers out of hall, in secret and in private rooms, for from this arises waste and no honor to the lord and lady." He also recommended watching that the servants not make off with leftovers to make merry at rere-suppers, rather than giving it as alms. Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the wealthy increasingly sought to escape this regime of stern collectivism. When possible, rich hosts retired with their consorts to private chambers where the meal could be enjoyed in greater exclusivity and privacy. Being invited to a lord's chambers was a great privilege and could be used as a way to reward friends and allies and to awe subordinates. It allowed lords to distance themselves further from the household and to enjoy more luxurious treats while serving inferior food to the rest of the household that still dined in the great hall. At major occasions and banquets, however, the host and hostess generally dined in the great hall with the other diners. Although there are descriptions of dining etiquette on special occasions, less is known about the details of day-to-day meals of the elite or about the table manners of the common people and the destitute. However, it can be assumed there were no such extravagant luxuries as multiple courses, luxurious spices or hand-washing in scented water in everyday meals.
Things were different for the wealthy. Before the meal and between courses, shallow basins and linen towels were offered to guests so they could wash their hands, as cleanliness was emphasized. Social codes made it difficult for women to uphold the ideal of immaculate neatness and delicacy while enjoying a meal, so the wife of the host often dined in private with her entourage or ate very little at such feasts. She could then join dinner only after the potentially messy business of eating was done. Overall, fine dining was a predominantly male affair, and it was uncommon for anyone but the most honored of guests to bring his wife or her ladies-in-waiting. The hierarchical nature of society was reinforced by etiquette where the lower ranked were expected to help the higher, the younger to assist the elder, and men to spare women the risk of sullying dress and reputation by having to handle food in an unwomanly fashion. Shared drinking cups were common even at lavish banquets for all but those who sat at the high table, as was the standard etiquette of breaking bread and carving meat for one's fellow diners.
Food was mostly served on plates or in stew pots, and diners would take their share from the dishes and place it on trenchers of stale bread, wood or pewter with the help of spoons or bare hands. In lower-class households it was common to eat food straight off the table. Knives were used at the table, but most people were expected to bring their own, and only highly favoured guests would be given a personal knife. A knife was usually shared with at least one other dinner guest, unless one was of very high rank or well acquainted with the host. Forks for eating were not in widespread usage in Europe until the early modern period, and early on were limited to Italy. Even there it was not until the 14th century that the fork became common among Italians of all social classes. The change in attitudes can be illustrated by the reactions to the table manners of the Byzantine princess Theodora Doukaina in the late 11th century. She was the wife of Domenico Selvo, the Doge of Venice, and caused considerable dismay among upstanding Venetians. The princess's insistence on having her food cut up by her eunuch servants and then eating the pieces with a golden fork shocked and upset the diners so much that there was a claim that Peter Damian, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, later interpreted her refined foreign manners as pride and referred to her as "... the Venetian Doge's wife, whose body, after her excessive delicacy, entirely rotted away."
Food preparation.
All types of cooking were done using a fire. Kitchen stoves did not appear until the 18th century, and cooks had to know how to cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and existed only in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.
Fruit was readily combined with meat, fish and eggs. The recipe for "Tart de brymlent", a fish pie from the recipe collection "The Forme of Cury", includes a mix of figs, raisins, apples, and pears with fish (salmon, cod, or haddock) and pitted damson plums under the top crust. It was considered important to make sure that the dish agreed with contemporary standards of medicine and dietetics. This meant that food had to be "tempered" according to its nature by an appropriate combination of preparation and mixing certain ingredients, condiments and spices; fish was seen as being cold and moist, and best cooked in a way that heated and dried it, such as frying or oven baking, and seasoned with hot and dry spices; beef was dry and hot and should therefore be boiled; pork was hot and moist and should therefore always be roasted. In some recipe collections, alternative ingredients were assigned with more consideration to the humoral nature than what a modern cook would consider to be similarity in taste. In a recipe for quince pie, cabbage is said to work equally well, and in another turnips could be replaced by pears.
The completely edible shortcrust pie did not appear in recipes until the 15th century. Before that the pastry was primarily used as a cooking container in a technique known as huff paste. Extant recipe collections show that gastronomy in the Late Middle Ages developed significantly. New techniques, like the shortcrust pie and the clarification of jelly with egg whites began to appear in recipes in the late 14th century and recipes began to include detailed instructions instead of being mere memory aids to an already skilled cook.
Medieval kitchens.
In most households, cooking was done on an open hearth in the middle of the main living area, to make efficient use of the heat. This was the most common arrangement, even in wealthy households, for most of the Middle Ages, where the kitchen was combined with the dining hall. Toward the Late Middle Ages a separate kitchen area began to evolve. The first step was to move the fireplaces toward the walls of the main hall, and later to build a separate building or wing that contained a dedicated kitchen area, often separated from the main building by a covered arcade. This way, the smoke, odors and bustle of the kitchen could be kept out of sight of guests, and the fire risk lessened. Few medieval kitchens survive as they were "notoriously ephemeral structures".
Many basic variations of cooking utensils available today, such as frying pans, pots, kettles, and waffle irons, already existed, although they were often too expensive for poorer households. Other tools more specific to cooking over an open fire were spits of various sizes, and material for skewering anything from delicate quails to whole oxen. There were also cranes with adjustable hooks so that pots and cauldrons could easily be swung away from the fire to keep them from burning or boiling over. Utensils were often held directly over the fire or placed into embers on tripods. To assist the cook there were also assorted knives, stirring spoons, ladles and graters. In wealthy households one of the most common tools was the mortar and sieve cloth, since many medieval recipes called for food to be finely chopped, mashed, strained and seasoned either before or after cooking. This was based on a belief among physicians that the finer the consistency of food, the more effectively the body would absorb the nourishment. It also gave skilled cooks the opportunity to elaborately shape the results. Fine-textured food was also associated with wealth; for example, finely milled flour was expensive, while the bread of commoners was typically brown and coarse. A typical procedure was "farcing" (from the Latin "farcio" 'to cram'), to skin and dress an animal, grind up the meat and mix it with spices and other ingredients and then return it into its own skin, or mold it into the shape of a completely different animal.
The kitchen staff of huge noble or royal courts occasionally numbered in the hundreds: pantlers, bakers, waferers, sauciers, larderers, butchers, carvers, page boys, milkmaids, butlers, and numerous scullions. While an average peasant household often made do with firewood collected from the surrounding woodlands, the major kitchens of households had to cope with the logistics of providing at least two meals daily for several hundred people. Guidelines on how to prepare for a two-day banquet can be found in the cookbook "Du fait de cuisine" ('On cookery') written in 1420 in part to compete with the court of Burgundy by Maistre Chiquart, master chef of Duke Amadeus VIII of Savoy. Chiquart recommends that the chief cook should have at hand at least 1,000 cartloads of "good, dry firewood" and a large "barnful" of coal.
Preservation.
Food preservation methods were basically the same as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food to a number of chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving, or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs, or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice, or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in honey, sugar, or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains and fruits were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.
Professional cooking.
The majority of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was self-sufficiency with only a small percentage of production being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support a wide variety of food establishments that catered to various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell ready-made hot food, an early form of fast food, or offer cooking services while the customers supplied some or all of the ingredients. Travelers, such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the more affluent, there were many types of specialists that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, saucers, and waferers, for example. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden of hosting a major banquet.
Urban cookshops that catered to workers or the destitute were regarded as unsavory and disreputable places by the well-to-do and professional cooks tended to have a bad reputation. Geoffrey Chaucer's Hodge of Ware, the London cook from the "Canterbury Tales", is described as a sleazy purveyor of unpalatable food. French cardinal Jacques de Vitry's sermons from the early 13th century describe sellers of cooked meat as an outright health hazard. While the necessity of the cook's services was occasionally recognized and appreciated, they were often disparaged since they catered to the baser of bodily human needs rather than spiritual betterment. The stereotypical cook in art and literature was male, hot-tempered, prone to drunkenness, and often depicted guarding his stewpot from being pilfered by both humans and animals. In the early 15th century, the English monk John Lydgate articulated the beliefs of many of his contemporaries by proclaiming that "Hoot ffir [fire] and smoke makith many an angry cook."
Cereals.
The period between 500 and 1300 saw a major change in diet that affected most of Europe. More intense agriculture on ever-increasing acreage resulted in a shift from animal products, like meat and dairy, to various grains and vegetables as the staple of the majority population. Before the 14th century, bread was not as common among the lower classes, especially in the north where wheat was more difficult to grow. A bread-based diet became gradually more common during the 15th century and replaced warm intermediate meals that were porridge- or gruel-based. Leavened bread was more common in wheat-growing regions in the south, while unleavened flatbread of barley, rye, or oats remained more common in northern and highland regions, and unleavened flatbread was also common as provisions for troops.
The most common grains were rye, barley, buckwheat, millet, and oats. Rice remained a fairly expensive import for most of the Middle Ages and was grown in northern Italy only toward the end of the period. Wheat was common all over Europe and was considered to be the most nutritious of all grains, but was more prestigious and thus more expensive. The finely sifted white flour that modern Europeans are most familiar with was reserved for the bread of the upper classes. As one descended the social ladder, bread became coarser, darker, and its bran content increased. In times of grain shortages or outright famine, grains could be supplemented with cheaper and less desirable substitutes like chestnuts, dried legumes, acorns, ferns, and a wide variety of more or less nutritious vegetable matter.
One of the common constituents of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar. Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries. Grain, either as bread crumbs or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews, alone or in combination with almond milk. By the Late Middle Ages biscuits (cookies in the U.S. and Canada) and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties.
The importance of bread as a daily staple meant that bakers played a crucial role in any medieval community. Bread consumption was high in most of Western Europe by the 14th century. Estimates of bread consumption from different regions are fairly similar: around of bread per person per day. Among the first town guilds to be organized were the bakers, and laws and regulations were passed to keep bread prices stable. The English "Assize of Bread and Ale" of 1266 listed extensive tables where the size, weight, and price of a loaf of bread were regulated in relation to grain prices. The baker's profit margin stipulated in the tables was later increased through successful lobbying from the London Baker's Company by adding the cost of everything from firewood and salt to the baker's wife, house, and dog. Since bread was such a central part of the medieval diet, swindling by those who were trusted with supplying the precious commodity to the community was considered a serious offense. Bakers who were caught tampering with weights or adulterating dough with less expensive ingredients could receive severe penalties. This gave rise to the "baker's dozen": a baker would give 13 for the price of 12, to be certain of not being known as a cheat.
Fruits and vegetables.
Plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and herbs varied in consumption with seasonal changes. The facility with which these goods could be supplied relied heavily on environmental and practical obstacles like storage capacity, changes in weather, and crop growth. In the later medieval period, increased urbanization provided more of the population with access to diverse fruits and vegetables as a result of trade.
Fruits were popular and could be served fresh, dried, or preserved, and were a common ingredient in many cooked dishes. Since honey and sugar were both expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, quinces, and grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and wild strawberries were more common. Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.
While grains were the primary constituent of most meals, vegetables, such as cabbage, chard, onions, garlic, and carrots, were common foodstuffs. Many of these were eaten daily by peasants and workers and were less prestigious than meat. Cookbooks, which appeared in the late Middle Ages and were intended mostly for those who could afford such luxuries, contained only a small number of recipes using vegetables as the main ingredient. The lack of recipes for many basic vegetable dishes, such as potages, has been interpreted not to mean that they were absent from the meals of the nobility, but rather that they were considered so basic that they did not require recording. Carrots were available in many variants during the Middle Ages: among them a tastier reddish-purple variety and a less prestigious green-yellow type. Various legumes, such as chickpeas, fava beans, and field peas were also common and important sources of protein, especially among the lower classes. With the exception of peas, legumes were often viewed with some suspicion by the dietitians advising the upper class, partly because of their tendency to cause flatulence but also because they were associated with the coarse food of peasants. The importance of vegetables to the common people is illustrated by accounts from 16th century Germany stating that many peasants ate sauerkraut three or four times a day.
Common and often basic ingredients in many modern European cuisines, such as potatoes, kidney beans, cacao, vanilla, tomatoes, chili peppers, and maize, were not available to Europeans until after 1492, after European contact with the Americas. Even after their wider availability in Europe, it often took considerable time (sometimes several centuries) for the new foodstuffs to be accepted by society at large.
The incorporation of nuts within the medieval diet was largely a result of the notable ease with which they could be stored. Additionally, their caloric density made them ideal to mitigate exhaustion from periods of labor. Thus, they were widely relied upon as a nutritious food source in times of emergencies. Nuts could be found growing wild or in cultivated royal estates. Such nuts included almonds, chestnuts, walnuts, and filberts. As sources of food supplies in densely populated areas became largely dependent on royal or clerical estates, exploitation resulted in nutritional consequences for poorer folk. Thus, the foraging of nuts in less expansive regions of agriculture functioned as an advantage within smaller communities. Nuts were incorporated in many kinds of recipes. Featured often in many parts of the medieval diet, they were used in dishes like muesli or eaten alongside vegetables like kale. Hazelnuts in particular are present in many archaeological and historical records.
Imported foreign goods from the Continent and the Mediterranean were common amongst the wealthy in medieval Ireland. Walnuts and almonds were frequently preserved and consumed along with dried fruits. Households in England with the financial means would seasonally consume fruits and nuts to compensate for the dietary restrictions of Lent. This tradition persisted long after the medieval ages, as raisins and hazelnuts were consumed in tandem during periods of fasting into the eighteenth century.
Dairy products.
Milk was an important source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat. It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common. Plain fresh milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly. Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or milk that was soured or watered down. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products because of the lack of technology to keep it from spoiling. On occasion, it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was difficult to keep fresh in bulk, and almond milk was generally used in its place.
Cheese was far more important as a foodstuff, especially for common people, and it has been suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes. Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan, were available and well known in late medieval times. There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses. Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas. Butter, another important dairy product, was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production in the latter half of the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. While most other regions used oil or lard as cooking fats, butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas. Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward.
Meats.
While all forms of wild game were popular among those who could obtain it, most meat came from domestic animals. Domestic working animals that were no longer able to work were slaughtered but not particularly appetizing and therefore were less valued as meat. Beef was not as common as today because raising cattle was labor-intensive, requiring pastures and feed, and oxen and cows were much more valuable as draught animals and for producing milk. Lamb and mutton were fairly common, especially in areas with a sizeable wool industry, as was veal. Goat meat was consumed in some parts of medieval Europe. Far more common was pork, as domestic pigs required less attention and cheaper feed. Domestic pigs often ran freely even in towns and could be fed on just about any organic waste, and suckling pig was a sought-after delicacy. Just about every part of the pig was eaten, including ears, snout, tail, tongue, and womb. The intestines, bladder, and stomach could be used as casings for sausage or even illusion food such as giant eggs. Among the meats that today are rare or even considered inappropriate for human consumption are the hedgehog and porcupine, occasionally mentioned in late medieval recipe collections. Rabbits remained a rare and highly prized commodity. In England, they were deliberately introduced by the 13th century and their colonies were carefully protected. Further south, domesticated rabbits were commonly bred and raised both for their meat and fur. It is frequently and falsely claimed that they were of particular value for monasteries because newborn rabbits were allegedly declared fish (or at least not meat) by church officials, allowing them to be eaten during Lent.
A wide range of birds were eaten, including pheasants, swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, pigeons, larks, finches, and just about any other wild bird that could be captured. Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were eaten only by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. As today, ducks and geese had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken, the poultry equivalent of the pig. The barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was therefore considered acceptable food for fasting and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.
Meats were more expensive than plant foods and could be up to four times as expensive as bread. Fish was up to 16 times as costly, and was expensive even for coastal populations. This meant that fasts could mean an especially meager diet for those who could not afford alternatives to meat and animal products like milk and eggs. It was only after the Black Death had eradicated up to half of the European population that meat became more common even for poorer people. The drastic reduction in many populated areas resulted in a labor shortage, meaning that wages dramatically increased. It also left vast areas of farmland untended, making it available for pasture and putting more meat on the market.
Fish and seafood.
Although less prestigious than other animal meats, and often seen as merely an alternative to meat on fast days, seafood was the mainstay of many coastal populations. "Fish" to the medieval person was also a general name for anything not considered a proper land-living animal, including marine mammals such as whales and porpoises. Also included were the beaver, due to its scaly tail and considerable time spent in water, and barnacle geese, due to the belief that they developed underwater in the form of barnacles. Such foods were also considered appropriate for fast days, though the rather contrived classification of barnacle geese as fish was not universally accepted. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II examined barnacles and noted no evidence of any bird-like embryo in them, and the secretary of Leo of Rozmital wrote a very skeptical account of his reaction to being served barnacle goose at a fish-day dinner in 1456.
Especially important was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, and it was one of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. Stockfish, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of mollusks, including oysters, mussels, and scallops, were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Freshwater fish such as eel, pike, carp, bream, perch, lamprey, salmon, and trout were common.
Drink.
While water is often drunk with a meal in modern times, in the Middle Ages concerns over purity, medical recommendations, and its low prestige value made it less favored. As such, alcoholic beverages were preferred. Such beverages contributed to many components of late-medieval life. Alcohol was often consumed throughout the day, and drinks were expected to accompany any social occasion. Rituals, rites, and festivals entailed the consumption of alcohol, which would often be distributed by officials. The different forms of alcohol popularized throughout various regions all contributed to a substantial portion of the population’s caloric intake, and were highly significant to diet and survival. The consumption of alcohol was also perceived to be a necessity in conserving one’s physical health. It was seen as more nutritious and beneficial to digestion than water, with the invaluable bonus of being less prone to putrefaction due to the alcohol content. Wine was consumed on a daily basis in most of France and all over the Western Mediterranean wherever grapes were cultivated. Further north it remained the preferred drink of the bourgeoisie and the nobility who could afford it, and far less common among peasants and workers. The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily beer or ale.
Juices, as well as wines, of a multitude of fruits and berries had been known at least since Roman antiquity and were still consumed in the Middle Ages, including those of pomegranate, mulberry, and blackberry. Perry and cider were especially popular in the north, where both apples and pears were plentiful. Medieval drinks that have survived to this day include "prunellé" from wild plums (modern-day slivovitz), mulberry gin and blackberry wine. Many variants of mead have been found in medieval recipes, with or without alcoholic content. However, the honey-based drink became less common as a table beverage towards the end of the period and was eventually relegated to medicinal use. Mead has often been presented as the common drink of the Slavs. This is partially true since mead bore great symbolic value at important occasions. When agreeing on treaties and other important affairs of state, mead was often presented as a ceremonial gift. It was also common at weddings and baptismal parties, though in limited quantity due to its high price. In medieval Poland, mead had a status equivalent to that of imported luxuries, such as spices and wines. Kumis, the fermented milk of mares or camels, was known in Europe, but as with mead was mostly something prescribed by physicians.
Plain milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, being reserved for the very young or elderly, and then usually as buttermilk or whey. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products because of the lack of technology to keep it from spoiling. Tea and coffee, both made from plants found in the Old World, were popular in East Asia and the Muslim world during the Middle Ages. However, neither of these non-alcoholic social drinks were consumed in Europe before the late 16th and early 17th centuries.
Wine.
Wine was commonly drunk and was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice. According to Galen's dietetics, it was considered hot and dry; however, these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down. Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine in moderation (especially red wine) was, among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good blood and brighten the mood. The quality of wine differed considerably according to vintage, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape pressings. The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes. The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content. Common folk usually had to settle for a cheap white or rosé from a second or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication. For the poorest (or the most pious), watered-down vinegar (similar to Ancient Roman "posca") would often be the only available choice. Wine was widely consumed across medieval Europe. It maintained its status in Italy as the reigning beverage over other forms of alcohol with little divergence. Wine consumption in Italian towns of the late medieval period reached figures of up to 415 liters annually per capita, as compared to a modern value of about 60. 
The aging of high-quality red wine required specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation must have been a widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. The 14th-century cookbook "Le Viandier" describes several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and "claré". By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.
Conventional, well-prepared wines of the time did not differ tremendously in strength from current figures. The alcoholic content of such wine is estimated to be between 5 and 11 percent alcohol by volume, as compared to a range of 11 to 13 percent in modern wines. While there is speculation that the French mixed water with their wine and thus decreased the alcoholic content by volume, one account from a thirteenth century Franciscan friar denounced the French for drinking undiluted wine, suggesting that it was not abnormal for wine to be consumed straight.
Beer.
While wine was the most common table beverage in much of Europe, this was not the case in the northern regions where grapes were not cultivated. Those who could afford it drank imported wine; even for nobility in these areas, however, it was common to drink beer or ale, particularly toward the end of the Middle Ages. In England, the Low Countries, northern Germany, Poland and Scandinavia, beer was consumed on a daily basis by people of all social classes and age groups. By the mid-15th century, barley, a cereal known to be somewhat poorly suited for breadmaking but excellent for brewing, accounted for 27% of all cereal acreage in England. However, the heavy influence from Arab and Mediterranean culture on medical science (particularly due to the Reconquista and the influx of Arabic texts) meant that beer was often disfavoured. For most medieval Europeans, it was a humble brew compared with common southern drinks and cooking ingredients, such as wine, lemons and olive oil. Even comparatively exotic products like camel milk and gazelle meat generally received more positive attention in medical texts. Beer was just an acceptable alternative and was assigned various negative qualities. In 1256, the Sienese physician Aldobrandino described beer in the following way:
But from whichever it is made, whether from oats, barley or wheat, it harms the head and the stomach, it causes bad breath and ruins the teeth, it fills the stomach with bad fumes, and as a result anyone who drinks it along with wine becomes drunk quickly; but it does have the property of facilitating urination and makes one's flesh white and smooth.
The intoxicating effect of beer was believed to last longer than that of wine, but it was also admitted that it did not create the "false thirst" associated with wine. Though less prominent than in the north, beer was consumed in northern France and the Italian mainland. Perhaps as a consequence of the Norman Conquest and the travelling of nobles between France and England, one French variant described in the 14th century cookbook "Le Menagier de Paris" was called "godale" (most likely a direct borrowing from the English 'good ale') and was made from barley and spelt, but without hops. In England there were also the variants "poset ale", made from hot milk and cold ale, and "brakot" or "braggot", a spiced honey ale prepared much like hypocras.
That hops could be used for flavoring beer had been known at least since Carolingian times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the widespread use of hops, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used. Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops but could be less reliable depending on which herbs were in it; as such, the end result was much more variable. Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.
Before hops became popular as an ingredient, it was difficult to preserve this beverage for any time, so it was mostly consumed fresh, though there are references to the use of hops in beer as early as 822 AD. It was unfiltered, and therefore cloudy, and likely had a lower alcohol content than the typical modern equivalent. Quantities of beer consumed by medieval residents of Europe, as recorded in contemporary literature, far exceed intakes in the modern world. For example, sailors in 16th-century England and Denmark received a ration of of beer per day. Polish peasants consumed up to of beer per day.
In the Early Middle Ages, beer was brewed primarily in monasteries, and on a smaller scale, in individual households. By the High Middle Ages, breweries in the fledgling medieval towns of northern Germany began to take over production. Though most of the breweries were small family businesses that employed at most eight to ten people, regular production allowed for investment in better equipment and increased experimentation with new recipes and brewing techniques. These operations later spread to the Netherlands in the 14th century, then to Flanders and Brabant, and reached England by the 15th century. Hopped beer became very popular in the last decades of the Late Middle Ages. In England and the Low Countries, the per capita annual consumption was around , and it was consumed with practically every meal: low alcohol-content beers for breakfast, and stronger ones later in the day. When perfected as an ingredient, hops could make beer keep for six months or more, and facilitated extensive exports. In late medieval England, the word "beer" came to mean a hopped beverage, whereas ale had to be unhopped. In turn, ale or beer was classified as "strong" or "small", the latter less intoxicating, regarded as a drink of temperate people, and suitable for consumption by children. As late as 1693, John Locke stated that the only drink he considered suitable for children of all ages was small beer, while criticizing the apparently common practice among Englishmen of the time to give their children wine and strong alcohol.
By modern standards, the brewing process was relatively inefficient, but capable of producing quite strong alcohol when that was desired. A 1998 attempt to recreate medieval English "strong ale" using recipes and techniques of the era (albeit with the use of modern yeast strains) yielded a strongly alcoholic brew with original gravity of 1.091 (corresponding to a potential alcohol content over 9%) and "pleasant, apple-like taste".
Distillates.
The ancient Greeks and Romans knew of the technique of distillation, but it was not practiced on a major scale in Europe until after the invention of alembics, which feature in manuscripts from the ninth century onward. Distillation was believed by medieval scholars to produce the essence of the liquid being purified, and the term "aqua vitae" ('water of life') was used as a generic term for all kinds of distillates. The early use of various distillates, alcoholic or not, was varied, but it was primarily culinary or medicinal; grape syrup mixed with sugar and spices was prescribed for a variety of ailments, and rosewater was used as a perfume and cooking ingredient and for hand washing. Alcoholic distillates were also occasionally used to create dazzling, fire-breathing entremets (a type of entertainment dish after a course) by soaking a piece of cotton in spirits. It would then be placed in the mouth of the stuffed, cooked and occasionally redressed animals, and lit just before presenting the creation.
"Aqua vitae" in its alcoholic forms was highly praised by medieval physicians. In 1309, Arnaldus of Villanova wrote that "[i]t prolongs good health, dissipates superfluous humours, reanimates the heart and maintains youth." In the Late Middle Ages, the production of moonshine started to pick up, especially in the German-speaking regions. By the 13th century, "Hausbrand" (literally 'home-burnt' from "gebrannter wein, brandwein" 'burnt [distilled] wine') was commonplace, marking the origin of brandy. Toward the end of the Late Middle Ages, the consumption of spirits became so ingrained even among the general population that restrictions on sales and production began to appear in the late 15th century. In 1496, the city of Nuremberg issued restrictions on the selling of "aquavit" on Sundays and official holidays.
Herbs, spices, and condiments.
Spices were among the most luxurious products available in the Middle Ages, the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and the cheaper alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. They all had to be imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them extremely expensive, and gave them social cachet such that pepper, for example, was hoarded, traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion. It has been estimated that around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000 tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. While pepper was the most common spice, the most exclusive (though not the most obscure in its origin) was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor, for according to the humours, yellow signified hot and dry, valued qualities; turmeric provided a yellow substitute, and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore: at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal Riario offered to Eleanor of Naples in June 1473, the bread was gilded. Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal, and cubeb. Sugar, unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities. Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb, but rather a combination of several different ones. Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste, for example parsley and cloves or pepper and ginger.
Common herbs such as sage, mustard, and parsley were grown and used in cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill, and fennel. Many of these plants grew throughout all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat dishes and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.
Extant medieval recipes frequently call for flavoring with a number of sour, tart liquids. Wine, verjuice (the juice of unripe grapes or fruits), vinegar, and the juices of various fruits, especially those with tart flavors, were almost universal and a hallmark of late medieval cooking. In combination with sweeteners and spices, it produced a distinctive "pungeant, fruity" flavor. Equally common, and used to complement the tanginess of these ingredients, were (sweet) almonds. They were used in a variety of ways: whole, shelled or unshelled, slivered, ground, and, most importantly, processed into almond milk. This last type of non-dairy milk product is probably the single most common ingredient in late medieval cooking and blended the aroma of spices and sour liquids with a mild taste and creamy texture.
Salt was ubiquitous and indispensable in medieval cooking. Salting and drying was the most common form of food preservation and meant that fish and meat in particular were often heavily salted. Many medieval recipes specifically warn against oversalting and there were recommendations for soaking certain products in water to get rid of excess salt. Salt was present during more elaborate or expensive meals. The richer the host, and the more prestigious the guest, the more elaborate would be the container in which it was served and the higher the quality and price of the salt. Wealthy guests were seated "above the salt", while others sat "below the salt", where salt cellars were made of pewter, precious metals or other fine materials, often intricately decorated. The rank of a diner also decided how finely ground and white the salt was. Salt for cooking, preservation or for use by common people was coarser; sea salt, or "bay salt", in particular, had more impurities, and was described in colors ranging from black to green. Expensive salt, on the other hand, looked like the standard commercial salt common today.
Sweets and desserts.
The term "dessert" comes from the Old French "desservir", 'to clear a table', literally 'to un-serve', and originated during the Middle Ages. It would typically consist of dragées and mulled wine accompanied by aged cheese, and by the Late Middle Ages could also include fresh fruit covered in honey, sugar, or syrup and boiled-down fruit pastes. Sugar, from its first appearance in Europe, was viewed as much as a drug as a sweetener; its long-lived medieval reputation as an exotic luxury encouraged its appearance in elite contexts accompanying meats and other dishes that to modern taste are more naturally savoury. There were a wide variety of fritters, crêpes with sugar, sweet custards and darioles, almond milk and eggs in a pastry shell that could also include fruit and sometimes even bone marrow or fish. German-speaking areas had a particular fondness for "krapfen": fried pastries and dough with various sweet and savory fillings. Marzipan in many forms was well-known in Italy and southern France by the 1340s, and is assumed to be of Arab origin. Anglo-Norman cookbooks are full of recipes for sweet and savory custards, potages, sauces, and tarts with strawberries, cherries, apples, and plums. The English chefs also had a penchant for using flower petals such as roses, violets, and elder flowers. An early form of quiche can be found in "Forme of Cury", a 14th-century recipe collection, as a "Torte de Bry" with a cheese and egg yolk filling.
"Le Ménagier de Paris" ("Parisian Household Book"), written in 1393, includes a quiche recipe made with three kinds of cheese, eggs, beet greens, spinach, fennel fronds, and parsley.
In northern France, a wide assortment of waffles and wafers was eaten with cheese and hypocras or a sweet malmsey as "issue de table" ('departure from the table'). The ever-present candied ginger, coriander, aniseed and other spices were referred to as "épices de chambre" ('parlor spices') and were taken as digestibles at the end of a meal to "close" the stomach. Like their Muslim counterparts in Spain, the Arab conquerors of Sicily introduced a wide variety of new sweets and desserts that eventually found their way to the rest of Europe. Just like Montpellier, Sicily was once famous for its "comfits", nougat candy ("torrone", or "turrón" in Spanish) and almond clusters ("confetti"). From the south, the Arabs also brought the art of ice cream-making that produced sorbet and several examples of sweet cakes and pastries; "cassata alla Siciliana" (from Arabic "qas'ah", the term for the terracotta bowl with which it was shaped), made from marzipan, sponge cake with sweetened ricotta, and "cannoli alla Siciliana", originally "cappelli di turchi" ('Turkish hats'), fried, chilled pastry tubes with a sweet cheese filling.
Historiography and sources.
Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a somewhat neglected field of study. Misconceptions and outright errors were quite common among historians, and are still present in the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices. The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed to disguise the flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it. The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate. The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices, and thereby the reputation of the host, would have been effectively undone if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods.
The common method of grinding and mashing ingredients into pastes and the many potages and sauces has been used as an argument that most adults within the medieval nobility lost their teeth at an early age, and hence were forced to eat nothing but porridge, soup and ground-up meat. This has been demonstrated by historians such as Terence Scully to be an unfounded theory.
The numerous descriptions of banquets from the later Middle Ages concentrated on the pageantry of the event rather than the minutiae of the food, which was not the same for most banqueters as those choice "mets" served at the high table. Banquet dishes were apart from the mainstream of cuisine, and have been described as "the outcome of grand banquets serving political ambition rather than gastronomy; today as yesterday" by historian Maguelonne Toussant-Samat.
Cookbooks.
Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, compiled in the Middle Ages are among the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear toward the end of the 13th century. The "Liber de Coquina", perhaps originating near Naples, and the "Tractatus de modo preparandi" have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.
The recipes were often brief and did not give precise quantities. Cooking times and temperatures were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire. At best, cooking times could be specified as the time it took to say a certain number of prayers or how long it took to walk around a certain field. Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and practical training, working their way up in the highly defined kitchen hierarchy. A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes or written instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as "Le Ménagier de Paris" from the late 14th century. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.
The repertory of housekeeping instructions laid down by manuscripts like the "Ménagier de Paris" also include many details of overseeing correct preparations in the kitchen. Toward the onset of the early modern period, in 1474, the Vatican librarian Bartolomeo Platina wrote "De honesta voluptate et valetudine" ("On honorable pleasure and health"). In 1563, the physician Iodocus Willich edited "Apicius", in Zürich.
High-status exotic spices and rarities like ginger, pepper, cloves, sesame, citron leaves and "onions of Escalon" all appear in an eighth-century list of spices that the Carolingian cook should have at hand. It was written by Vinidarius, whose excerpts of "Apicius" survive in an eighth-century uncial manuscript. Vinidarius's own dates may not be much earlier.

Tod Slaughter

Norman Carter Slaughter (19 March 1885 – 19 February 1956), also known as Tod Slaughter, was an English actor, best known for playing over-the-top villains in macabre film adaptations of Victorian melodramas.
Early life.
Slaughter was born on 19 March 1885 in Gosforth and attended the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne. The eldest surviving son of 12 children, he made his way onto the stage in 1905 at West Hartlepool. In 1913, he became a lessee of the Hippodrome theatres in the Richmond and Croydon areas of London. After a brief interruption to serve in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I, he returned to the stage.
Career.
Early career.
During Slaughter's early career, his stage name was "N. Carter Slaughter" and he primarily played the conventional leading man or character roles. After the war, he ran the Theatre Royal, Chatham before taking over the Elephant and Castle Theatre in London for a memorable few years from 1924 onwards that have since passed into British theatrical legend. His company revived Victorian "blood-and-thunder" melodramas such as "Maria Marten", "Sweeney Todd", "Jack Sheppard", and "The Silver King" to enthusiastic audiences—not just locals but also sophisticated theatregoers from the West End who might have initially come for a cheap laugh but ended up enthralled by the power of the fare on offer. Slaughter also staged other types of production such as the annual Christmas pantomime, where he cast prominent local personalities in bit parts for audience recognition. Despite a local protest, the Elephant and Castle Theatre was closed down in 1927, after Slaughter's company vacated it several months earlier.
In September 1912 he married stage actress Jenny Lynn, who had been playing comedy leads in West End shows. They appeared on stage, screen, and radio for more than 10,000 performances over the next 30 years. "Even their engagement had the shadow of crime across it," remarked "Picturegoer Weekly", "for Tod and his Jenny were playing in Lincoln at the time, and while they were taking a quiet stroll round the prison walls he proposed to her!" Slaughter kept a chicken farm just outside London during the 1930s but, according to his wife, "when he gets outside the studio he's so tender-hearted that he won't kill a chicken, even if it means going without his Sunday lunch."
It was in 1925 that he adopted the stage name "Tod Slaughter", but his primary roles were still character and heroic leads. He played the young hero in "The Face at the Window", poacher Tom Robinson in "It's Never Too Late To Mend", and village idiot Tim Winterbottom in "Maria Marten". He also played the title character in "The Return of Sherlock Holmes" and D'Artagnan in "The Three Musketeers". Silent footage exists of Slaughter acting on stage at the Elephant and Castle in the military melodrama "The Flag Lieutenant", in a documentary entitled "London After Dark". 
In 1931 at the New Theatre, London he played Long John Silver in "Treasure Island" during the day, and body snatcher William Hare in "The Crimes of Burke And Hare" at night. Publicised as "Mr. Murder", he lapped up his new-found notoriety by boasting he committed 15 murders each day for the duration of the run. Shortly afterwards, he played the title character in "Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street" for the first of 2,000 times on stage. Actor and role had found each other much in the same way as Béla Lugosi and "Dracula", and the seal was set on Slaughter's subsequent career.
Film career.
In 1934, at age 49, Slaughter began in films. Usually cast as a villain, his first film was "Maria Marten or Murder in the Red Barn" (1935), a Victorian melodrama filmed cheaply with Slaughter as the obvious evildoer, and identified as such at the beginning of the play. In the old melodramatic style, each main member of the cast is introduced before the play begins and has his role explained. When Slaughter comes on, he favours the audience with a cold, evil grin as the on-stage announcer says "Squire Corder, Lord of the Manor...and a villain! Whose blood may be blue—but whose heart is black as night!" This set the general tone for the film series. Each film was usually preceded by a spoken or printed introduction explaining the faithful re-creation of a dated melodrama, and inviting the audience to enjoy it.
Slaughter's next film role was as Sweeney Todd in "" (1936), directed and produced by George King, whose partnership with Slaughter was continued in the subsequent shockers: "The Crimes of Stephen Hawke" (1936); "It's Never Too Late To Mend" (1937); "The Ticket of Leave Man" (1938); "The Face at the Window" (1939) and "Crimes at the Dark House" (1940). Most of these films were "quota quickies", films made quickly and cheaply to fulfill a government requirement that a certain portion of all films distributed by British studios had to be British made. Many such were forgettable, low-quality films, but the lack of studio interest paradoxically guaranteed some degree of success: it gave the maker, by default, artistic control over the final product.
There were, however, some non-melodramatic and non-costume roles in his career. He was a supporting player in "The Song of the Road" (1937) and "Darby and Joan" (1937). In "Sexton Blake and the Hooded Terror" (1938), he played, in modern dress, the head of an international gang of supervillains.
Reception in America.
Tod Slaughter's blood-and-thunder films were too British in theme, too old-fashioned and broadly played for mainstream American audiences, and thus they were not released in the United States by any of the major film companies. Instead they were handled by independent distributors in New York (usually Select Attractions or Arthur Ziehm, Inc.), and they did attract a specialized following among horror fans. "Maria Marten", released in the United States as "Murder in the Red Barn", was reviewed by Frank Nugent of "The New York Times": "Tod Slaughter, the Corse Payton of London, is quite perfect as the ogling, lip-curling, 104 percent impure Squire. All [cast members] have been assembled at great expense -- as the gentleman in the prologue confides -- for your amusement. To make it really perfect, though, the World Cinema should install a bar and a hissing claque." On at least two occasions a Slaughter picture was paired with another British thriller for a "super-shocker" double feature, to cash in on the successful nationwide double bill of Universal's "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". 
Slaughter's especially florid "The Face at the Window", released as a Halloween attraction in October 1940, seemed made to order for audiences to indulge their fondness for rip-roaring thrills. The trade paper "Showmen's Trade Review" advised, "If audiences will let themselves go, they'll have a good time viewing this old-fashioned meller. The characters seem to have a great time acting all over the place. Almost anyone who views this will have as good a time as the characters." Paul Mooney, Jr. of "Motion Picture Herald" agreed: "Unabashedly a melodrama of the 'unhand me villain, my heart is pledged to another' cliche this British production has much to recommend it -- the hero, villain, and the girl overact in an authentic reproduction of the melodrama circa 1880, and, in addition, it is a pretty good mystery." "Motion Picture Daily" summed it up: "A splendid horror film. The situations are highly implausible, of course, and the film will probably be met with cynical reaction by some audiences, but it is perfect entertainment for the addicts of screen terrorism."
Later works.
Slaughter was busy on stage during World War II, performing "Jack the Ripper, Landru" and "Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde". There were also one-act sketches such as "The Touch of a Child".
After the war Slaughter resumed melodramatic roles on screen and starred in "The Curse of the Wraydons" (1946), in which Bruce Seton played the legendary Victorian bogeyman Spring-Heeled Jack, and "The Greed of William Hart" (1948) based on the murderous career of Burke and Hare. These were produced by Ambassador Films at Bushey Studios, which had made a healthy profit re-releasing Slaughter's 1930s films during the war years.
Last years.
During the early 1950s Tod Slaughter still regularly toured the provinces and London suburbs, but the public's appetite for melodrama seemed to have abated somewhat by this stage and he was declared bankrupt in 1953, owing to a downturn in his touring income. He continued to act in stage productions, such as Molière's "The Gay Invalid" opposite future horror star Peter Cushing, and acting as master of ceremonies at an evening of old-fashioned music hall entertainment.
Slaughter appeared as villain Terence Reilly in the seven-part television series "Inspector Morley: Late of Scotland Yard", starring Patrick Barr, Dorothy Bramhall, and Tucker McGuire. The episodes were re-edited into two theatrical motion pictures, "King of the Underworld" (1952) and "Murder at Scotland Yard" (1953). A version of "Spring-Heeled Jack" starring Slaughter, was one of the first live TV plays mounted by the BBC.
He was guest on the BBC radio programme "Desert Island Discs" on 24 March 1955.
Death.
On 19 February 1956, at the age of 70, Slaughter died of coronary thrombosis in Derby. After his death, which followed a performance of "Maria Marten", his work slipped almost completely into obscurity. Film historians have revived interest in Slaughter's cycle of melodramatic films, placing them in a tradition of "cinema of excess", which also includes the Gainsborough melodramas and Hammer Horrors.

Darragh Ó Sé

Darragh Ó Sé (born 5 March 1975 in Ard an Bhóthair, Ventry, County Kerry) is an Irish former Gaelic footballer. He plays with his local club, An Ghaeltacht, and was a member at senior level of the Kerry county team from 1997 until he announced his retirement in early 2010. Ó Sé has made 81 championship appearances, scoring one goal and 31 points. He also appeared for Kerry in 95 National Football League games scoring one goal and 26 points. He is regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time. His younger brothers Tomás and Marc are also Gaelic footballers who have represented Kerry at the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship
Playing career.
Club.
Ó Sé played his club football with his local club called an Ghaeltacht and enjoyed a great deal of success during his career. He made his debut with the club's senior team in 1992 and was an ever-present fixture at midfield.
In 2000 an Ghaeltacht reached the final of the county senior championship for the very first time. Ó Sé's side were the red-hot favourites going into the match; however, all did not go as planned as Dr. Croke's took charge. A hard-fought 1–4 to 0–6 score line resulted in defeat for an Ghaeltacht.
In 2001 an Ghaeltacht were out to atone for this defeat. The team regrouped well and reached a second consecutive county final. Tralee-based club Austin Stack's provided the opposition on this occasion; however, Ó Sé's side were well prepared. A conclusive 1–13 to 0–10 victory gave Ó Sé a county winners' medal.
An Ghaeltacht surrendered their club title in 2002; however, the following year Ó Sé's side were back in the county championship decider. Laune Rangers were the opponents on this occasion, however, the game ended in a 0–10 apiece draw. The replay a fortnight later was a much more conclusive affair. A 0–12 to 2–4 score line gave an Ghaeltacht the victory and gave Ó Cinnéide a second county winners' medal in three years. This victory allowed the club to represent Kerry in the provincial club championship. A successful campaign saw Ó Sé's side reach the provincial final against St. Senan's of Clare. A close game developed, however, the Kerrymen held on in the end to secure a 1–8 to 1–6 victory, giving Ó Sé a Munster club winners' medal. An Ghaeltacht continued their march in the All-Ireland series and lined out on St. Patrick's Day 2004 in the All-Ireland club championship final. Caltra, a club from County Galway, provided the opposition and an exciting game developed. Dara Ó Cinnéide faced the heartbreak of missing a goal in the dying seconds as an Ghaeltacht lost out by just a single point – 0–13 to 0–12.
The following few years saw Ó Sé enjoy little success with the club after the victories of the earlier parts of the decade.
Minor &amp; under-21.
Ó Sé first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kerry minor football team in the early 1990s. He first lined out with his native county in that grade in 1993, however, Kerry were knocked out of the provincial championship at a very early stage.
Ó Sé subsequently joined the Kerry under-21 team in 1994. While it was an unsuccessful year for the team in that grade, Ó Sé's nailed down his position at midfield and the following year lined out in his first Munster under-21 final. Opponents Waterford were inflicted with a 1–21 to 2–5 trouncing, giving Ó Sé a Munster winners' medal in the under-21 grade. Kerry later qualified to play Mayo in the All-Ireland final. After the highs of the Munster final victory, Kerry were held to a draw and a replay was required. That game was also a close affair, however, Kerry's goal-scoring ability proved the key. A 3–10 to 1–12 score line saw Kerry claim the victory and gave Ó Sé an All-Ireland winners' medal with the Kerry under-21 team.
In 1996 Ó Sé was in his final year as a member of the Kerry under-21 team. A second Munster winners' medal was secured after an absolute trouncing of Clare in the provincial decider. The 3–14 to 0–6 victory put Kerry on the All-Ireland trail once again. Cavan provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland decider, however, that game was far from a rout. Kerry had the upper hand for much of the game and went on to win by 1–17 to 2–10. It was Ó Sé's second All-Ireland winners' medal in the under-21 grade.
College.
He played for Dublin Institute of Technology, with whom he won a Trench Cup in 1995.
Senior.
By this stage Ó Sé was also a member of the Kerry senior football team. He made his senior debut in a National Football League game against Donegal in the 1993–94 season. Ó Sé later made his championship debut against Limerick; however, Kerry were defeated on that occasion.
In 1995 Ó Sé played in his first senior Munster final against archrivals Cork. Expectations were high that 'the Kingdom' could defeat 'the Rebels' and break back into the big time after a three-year period in the wilderness. The game was a disappointing one for Ó Sé as his side lost by 0–15 to 1–9.
In 1996 Ó Sé's uncle Páidí took over as manager, and Kerry's fortunes improved. Cork provided the opposition once again in that year's provincial final, however, on this occasion Kerry were a different team. A 0–14 to 0–11 victory gave Ó Sé his first Munster winners' medal in the senior grade and kick-started the Kerry football revival. Kerry's next assignment was an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Mayo. In spite of claiming the provincial title, Kerry were still not the finished article. Ó Sé's side were eventually defeated by 2–13 to 1–10.
1997 saw Kerry through down an early marker with regard to their All-Ireland ambitions. The team reached the final of the National League that year with Cork providing the opposition in Páirc Uí Chaoimh. A 3–7 to 1–8 victory gave Ó Sé a winners' medal in Gaelic football's secondary competition. Later that summer Kerry reached the Munster final once again. Clare provided the opposition on this occasion; however, in spite of shocking the Kerry men five years earlier, there was no shock this time. A 1–13 to 0–11 victory saw Ó Sé add a second Munster winners' medal to his collection. A subsequent defeat of Cavan saw Kerry qualify for their first All-Ireland final in eleven years. Mayo, the defeated finalists of the previous year, provided the opposition. The westerners went on a scoring spree during the match, capturing 1–2 inside two minutes. Maurice Fitzgerald was the start player for Kerry. He scored nine points throughout the game while Mayo froze and were held scoreless for the last twenty minutes. A 0–13 to 1–7 score line gave Kerry the title and gave Ó Sé an All-Ireland winners' medal. Furthermore, Ó Sé had now started to stamp his authority as a quality midfielder and over the next 10 years would become one of the country's best.
Kerry continued their march again in 1998 with a Munster final showdown with Tipperary. For the third year in succession 'the Kingdom' proved the provincial masters, and a 0–17 to 1–10 win gave Ó Sé a third Munster title. Kerry were the favourites to retain their All-Ireland title; however, a narrow 0–13 to 1–9 defeat by a Mick O'Dwyer-managed Kildare in the semi-final brought an end to their All-Ireland quest.
In 1999 Kerry were attempting to secure a fourth provincial title in succession. Cork put an end to this dream with a 2–10 to 2–4 win over their great rivals in the Munster final. With that Kerry were dumped out of the championship.
After a low point the previous year, Kerry were back in the provincial decider again in 2000. Ó Sé lined out in his sixth Munster final, his second with Clare as opposition. In a disappointing match as regards a contest, Kerry walloped 'the Banner men' by 3–15 to 0–8. It was Ó Sé's fourth Munster medal. Kerry had firmly established their All-Ireland contender credentials, however, the All-Ireland series proved difficult. Ó Sé's side drew with Armagh in the semi-final, while the replay proved just as tense. Both sides finished level after seventy minutes once again and it took a period of extra-time to find a winner. Kerry narrowly emerged from that game as the 2–15 to 1–15 winners and booked a place in the Millennium All-Ireland final. Galway provided the opposition in what was their second championship decider appearance in three years. In a game to forget both sides missed easy chances and seemed apprehensive about taking a lead. Galway trailed by seven points at one stage, but clawed their way back to secure a 0–14 apiece draw. The replay was a much more conclusive affair. Galway worked the ball the length of the field to Declan Meehan who scored a goal to give the westerners a boost. A disputed free with seventeen minutes left in the game gave Kerry a lead which they would not relinquish. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the champions by 0–17 to 1–10. It was Ó Cinnéide's second All-Ireland winners' medal, while his performances also earned him an All-Star.
Kerry swept through the provincial series with ease again in 2001. A 0–19 to 1–13 defeat of Cork gave Ó Sé a fifth Munster winners' medal and gave Kerry a boost in their All-Ireland ambitions. In a new innovation called the All-Ireland qualifiers series, Kerry's provincial victory allowed them to advance to the All-Ireland quarter-final. An exciting draw and a replay with Dublin at Semple Stadium gave Ó Sé's side the right to advance to an All-Ireland semi-final showdown with Meath. There was some controversy leading up to the game with new squad member Eoin Brosnan getting the captaincy before the game, despite not yet having established himself as a regular. There was also great debate about the refusal to start the legendary Maurice Fitzgerald. Nonetheless, the public were expecting a classic. In one of the lowest points ever for Kerry football, Ó Sé's side were beaten by 'the Royals' on a score line of 2–14 to 0–5.
In 2002 Kerry faced more controversy. The team were forced to play a replay of their Munster semi-final against Cork only a few of days after the funeral of the brother of team manager Páidí Ó Sé and father of team members Darragh, Tomás and Marc Ó Sé. Cork took full advantage and Kerry embarked on a qualifier campaign which saw them account for Wicklow, Fermanagh and Kildare before they trounced reigning champions Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-final before stuffing archrivals Cork in a unique all-Munster All-Ireland semi-final. The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted Kerry against Armagh in one of the great finals of recent years. The first-half saw everything going Kerry's way while Armagh floundered. The Ulster men lost John McEntee to concussion while Oisín McConville missed a penalty just before the interval. As it stood Armagh trailed by four points at half-time while Ó Sé gave an inspirational performance. A different Armagh team emerged in the second-half. McConville compensated for his earlier miss by scoring a key goal in the 55th minute. Kerry froze after this and failed to score for the rest of the match as Armagh went on to narrowly win their first All-Ireland by 1–12 to 0–14. In spite of this defeat Ó Sé picked up a second All Star.
Kerry regrouped after this blow and reached the provincial decider once again in 2003. Limerick provided the opposition; however, they were no match for 'the Kingdom'. A 1–11 to 0–9 victory gave Ó Sé a sixth Munster winners' medal. After an exciting game with Roscommon, Kerry advanced to an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Tyrone. After being shocked in the latter stages of the two previous championships, Kerry were out to atone and were favourites going into the match. The whole team struggled; however, and Kerry looked like they were going to be left behind with the new "blanket defence" that was introduced by teams like Armagh and perfected by Tyrone. Many criticised this tactic as a means of stopping talented footballers like Ó Sé and Colm Cooper from playing but few could deny its effectiveness. A 0–13 to 0–6 defeat saw Tyrone advance to the All-Ireland final while Kerry were knocked out of the championship.
2004 saw Jack O'Connor take over as manager of the Kerry team. That year 'the Kingdom' booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and, for the second year in succession, Limerick were the opponents. Surprisingly, that game ended in a 1–10 apiece draw. The replay was also a close-run affair; however, Kerry never really looked in danger of losing. A 3–10 to 2–9 victory gave Ó Sé a seventh Munster winners' medal. The All-Ireland series proved no difficulty for Kerry; however, Ó Sé picked up an injury in the semi-final which ruled him out of the final against Mayo. A 1–20 to 2–9 championship decider victory gave Kerry the victory.
In 2005 Kerry were hot favourites to retain their All-Ireland title. All was going to plan as Ó Sé's side reached yet another provincial final. In a return to tradition, Cork were the opponents. A close game developed, however, in the end Kerry were the narrow winners by 1–11 to 0–11. It was Ó Sé's eighth Munster winners' medal. Following this win Kerry cruised through the All-Ireland series to reach another championship decider with Tyrone providing the opposition. In one of the great finals of the decade, the result remained in doubt until the final whistle. Ó Cinnéide powered his team ahead with a goal after just six minutes. Tyrone responded in kind with a Peter Canavan goal just before half-time. Tomás Ó Sé launched the Kerry comeback in the 57th minute with Kerry's second goal; however, it was too late. Tyrone hung on to win by 1–16 to 2–10. It was Ó Sé's second defeat in an All-Ireland final.
In 2006 Kerry reached the final of the National League and played Galway. Ó Sé's side could only manage three points in the opening half; however, the introduction of Eoin Brosnan transformed the team. At the end of the seventy minutes a 2–12 to 0–10 score line gave Kerry their 18th National League title. The league win was a false dawn as Kerry went out tamely to Cork in a replay of the Munster final. The team, however, bounced back against Longford to set up a meeting with Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter-final. At half-time it looked as though the Ulser hoodoo would strike again but Kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half with Ó Sé dominating midfield while Kieran Donaghy shone at full-forward. They won by a score of 3–15 to 1–13, in the process putting paid to the notion that Kerry had no answer to the northern style of defensive play. Kerry again beat Cork in the subsequent semi-final before lining out against Mayo in the All-Ireland final. An unbelievable opening first-half saw Kerry go 2–4 to no score ahead after just ten minutes, courtesy of goals by Declan O'Sullivan and Kieran Donaghy goals. Colm Cooper slotted a third Kerry goal; however, Mayo settled and reduced the deficit to 3–8 to 3–2 at half-time. The second thirty-five minutes saw Kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points. A final score of 4–15 to 3–5 gave Kerry another All-Ireland title and gave Ó Sé another All-Ireland winners' medal. Ó Sé finished off the year with a second All-Star award.
In 2007 Ó Sé had a fine National League campaign which carried on into the Munster Championship. That year Kerry faced Cork in the provincial decider once again. A close game developed; however, at the full-time whistle Kerry were the champions by 1–15 to 1–13. It was Ó Sé's ninth Munster winners' medal. Kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their All-Ireland quarter-final against Monaghan, setting up a glamour All-Ireland semi-final tie with Dublin. Ó Sé spent much of the game on the bench after picking up a hip injury, however, he was introduced as a substitute to help Kerry see off a Dublin comeback and win by two points. The subsequent All-Ireland final was an historic occasion as Kerry faced Cork in the very first all-Munster championship decider. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. Cork goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3–13 to 1–9. It was a fifth All-Ireland medal for Ó Sé, his fourth on the field of play. A third All Star award quickly followed.
In 2008 there was speculation that Ó Sé, at the age of thirty-three, would retire from inter-county football. In the end he decided to line out with Kerry once again and help his team in their pursuit of a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. All did not go to plan as Ó Sé's side lost team captain Paul Galvin to suspension after an incident with referee Paddy Russell in the Munster semi-final against Clare. The subsequent Munster final saw Kerry take an eight-point lead over Cork at half-time. 'The Rebels' fought back and, in a massive downpour, Kerry could only muster three points in the second period of play as Cork secured a remarkable 1–16 to 1–11 victory. Furthermore, Ó Sé picked up a red card after an altercation with Pearse O'Neill. Kerry worked their way through to the All-Ireland semi-final where they faced Cork once again. 'The Kingdom' were much better in this encounter; however, Ó Sé received a straight red card for an incident with Pearse O'Neill once again. At this stage of the game Kerry were cruising and it looked as if Ó Sé would miss the All-Ireland final. Two very late goals by Cork secured a draw. The replay was also an exciting affair; however, Kerry overcame Cork in their third championship meeting that year. An All-Ireland final appearance against Tyrone was the reward for this victory, with Ó Sé lining out at midfield again. An exciting game developed, one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years. The sides were level seven times before Colm Cooper nudged Kerry 0–8 to 0–7 ahead before the interval. Tyrone simply wore Kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from Tommy McGuigan and a string of late points inspired Tyrone to their third All-Ireland title of the decade.
While many thought that the All-Ireland defeat would finally signal the end of Ó Sé's long career, he rejoined the panel again in 2009. He came on as a substitute in Kerry's National League victory over Derry to capture his third winners' medal in that competition. Kerry's next game was a Munster semi-final meeting with Cork. That game ended in a draw, however, Kerry were well beaten in the replay. 'The Kingdom' were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over Longford, Sligo and Antrim. Ó Sé and his squad later lined out in the All-Ireland quarter-final and thrashed Dublin before overcoming Meath in a disappointing semi-final. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Kerry face Cork for the third time in that year's championship. Ó Sé's side entered the game as slight underdogs, however, they had the trump card of having never lost a game to Cork at Croke Park. Kerry stuttered in the opening period and trailed by 0–1 to 1–3 early in the first-half. The Kerry team stuck to their gameplan while Cork recorded fourteen wides. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the champions again by 0–16 to 1–9. It was Ó Sé's sixth All-Ireland winners' medal, his fifth on the field of play. His contribution to the championship was later recognised when he picked up a fourth All-Star award.
A period of considerable speculation as to Ó Sé's future intentions ended in February 2010 when he announced his retirement from inter-county football in an interview in Irish with former teammate Dara Ó Cinnéide on the "An Saol ó Dheas" programme on RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta. He said that he had been considering the matter since Christmas but only came to a final decision at the beginning of February. Ó Sé added that he would continue to play with his club An Ghaeltacht and his divisional side Ciarraí Thiar.
Inter-provincial.
Ó Sé also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial championship and enjoyed some success. He first played with his province in 1996 as Munster defeated Ulster to set up a final date with Leinster. The men from the eastern province ran away with the victory in the end and defeated Ó Sé's side by 1–13 to 0–9.
After a few disappointing seasons where Ó Sé failed to be picked or faced defeat, Munster were back in the final again in 1999. Connacht were the opponents on this occasion; however, the men from the south made no mistake on this occasion. A 0–10 to 0–7 victory gave Ó Sé a Railway Cup winners' medal.
In 2007, at a time when most players would be contemplating retirement, Ó Sé was brought back to the Munster squad for the final time. The campaign was an ultimately disappointing one as Munster were defeated by Ulster in the Railway Cup final.
International Rules.
Ó Sé was chosen for duty with Ireland in the International Rules Series against Australia. He first lined out for his country in the first test in 2001. Ireland won that game and later went on to win the second test by a considerable margin. An aggregate score of 130–105 gave Ireland the series victory and gave Ó Sé an International Rules winners' medal.
Ó Sé was chosen for International Rules duty again the following year. Australia, however, narrowly won the first test by 65 to 58 points. The second test ended in a 42 points apiece draw. As a result of this Ireland lost by an aggregate score of 7 points.
Politics.
On 2 November 2012, media reported that Fianna Fáil had attempted to lure Ó Sé into their camp.
Personal life.
In 2021 Ó Sé was disqualified from driving for three years after he was found guilty of driving intoxicated and a urine sample found he was six times over the legal limit.

Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants

The Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, popularly known as CIMAP, is an Indian plant research laboratory and part of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Established originally as Central Indian Medicinal Plants Organisation (CIMPO) in 1959, CIMAP is steering multidisciplinary research in biological and chemical sciences and extending technologies and services to the farmers and entrepreneurs of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs). It is headquarterded in Lucknow and has research centres in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pantnagar and Purara.
History.
Recognizing the urgent need for stimulating research on medicinal plants in the country and for coordinating and consolidating some work already done by organizations like the Indian council of Agricultural Research, Indian Council of Medical Research, Tropical School of Medicine of Culcutta and various States Governments and Individual workers, the Council Scientific and Industrial Research approved in 1957 the establishment of the Central Indian Medicinal Plants Organization (CIMPO) with the following objectives. ‘To co-ordinate and channelise along fruitful directions the present activities in the field of medicinal plants carried out by the various agencies, State Governments etc., to develop the already existing medicinal plants resources of India, to bring under cultivation some of the important medicinal plants in great demand and also to introduce the cultivation into the country of exotic medicinal plants of high yielding active principal content’ It was further decide that as the work on all aspects of cultivation of aromatics plants was identical with all the cultivation of medicinal plants, the aromatic plants should also be covered within the scope of CIMPO. The Essential Oils Research Committee functioning under the Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research was then dissolved and its activities taken over by CIMPO. The Organization started functioning with effect from 26 March 1959 with the appointment of late Shri P.M. Nabar its first Officer Incharge.
The branch in Hyderabad was established on 7 July 1982.
In February 2024, CIMAP announced that it will set up a unit for the development of a synthetic biology platform for high-value phytomolecules. 
Research.
CIMAP Research Centres are aptly situated in different agro-climatic zones of the country to facilitate multi-location field trials and research. A little more than 50 years since its inception, today, CIMAP has extended its wings overseas with scientific collaboration agreements with Malaysia. CSIR-CIMAP has signed two agreements to promote bilateral cooperation between India and Malaysia in research, development and commercialization of MAP related technologies.
Mint varieties released and agro-packages developed and popularised by CIMAP has made India the global leader in mints and related industrial products. CIMAP has released several varieties of the MAPs, their complete agro-technology and post harvest packages which have revolutionised MAPs cultivation and business scenario of the country.

Brand New Girlfriend

Brand New Girlfriend is the second album from country music artist Steve Holy. It was released in 2006 on Curb Records. Prior to its release, Holy had charted five singles ("I'm Not Breakin'", "Rock-a-Bye Heart", "Put Your Best Dress On", "Go Home", and "It's My Time (Waste It If I Want To)") which were not released on albums, although they all charted.
The title track to "Brand New Girlfriend" became Holy's second Number One single on the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs charts, a position that it held for one week. At the time, its thirty-six-week climb to Number One was the slowest climb to Number One since the inception of Nielsen SoundScan in 1990. This record was broken one year later by Tracy Lawrence's "Find Out Who Your Friends Are", which reached Number One on its forty-first chart week. "Brand New Girlfriend" also reached No. 40 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and No. 60 on the Pop 100.
Following the title track, two other singles — "Come On Rain" and "Men Buy the Drinks (Girls Call the Shots)" — were released from this album, both peaking in the lower regions of the top 40 on the country charts. Also included is a cover of "All for the Love of Sunshine", which was previously a Number One country hit for Hank Williams, Jr. (and the Mike Curb Congregation) in 1970, while the song "Wrap Around" was originally recorded by Keith Anderson on his 2005 album "Three Chord Country and American Rock &amp; Roll".
Critical reception.
Jeffrey B. Remz of "Country Standard Time" gave the album a mixed review, saying that he considered Holy's performances strongest on the more traditionally-influenced songs and the title track.

Tulsi Ram Sharma

Tulsi Ram Sharma MBE was the first Indo-Fijian to qualify as a lawyer. He served one term as member of the Legislative Council and three terms as the President of Fiji Indian Football Association. He was one of the founding members of the Maha Sangh, but his association with farmers' union was short-lived. In 1941 he was appointed to Central Indian War Committee, formed by the Government to enlist the support of Indians to the war effort.
Member of Legislative Council.
After completing his law degree, Tulsi Ram started practising in Lautoka. In 1950, the two main organisations active in politics in the sugar cane growing districts of Fiji were the farmers’ unions, Kisan Sangh and Maha Sangh. A. D. Patel was the incumbent for the North West Indian Division and had the support of Maha Sangh while the preferred candidate for Kisan Sangh was Ayodhya Prasad. When Tulsi Ram also put up his nomination, Ayodhya Prasad withdrew in his favour as he did not want to split the anti-Patel votes. With the support of the Kisan Sangh, Tulsi Ram won the election by 2340 votes to 1850 votes. After the election Tulsi Ram declared his neutrality as he wanted both farmers’ unions to work together. The Kisan Sangh withdrew its support for Tulsi Ram and he was destined to be a one-term member of the Legislative Council.
President of Fiji Indian Football Association.
Tulsi Ram Sharma was the second President of the Fiji Indian Football Association, taking over its leadership two years after its formation in 1938. He served three terms as President; 1940–1945, 1948–1950, and 1954. Under his leadership Football Associations were formed in most districts of Fiji and a regular inter-district soccer tournament was organised. He also encouraged the inclusion of players of all races in his Association, although it was not until 1961 that the name was changed to Fiji Football Association.

<doc id="7030065" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7030065" title="J. Hunter Johnson">
J. Hunter Johnson

J. Hunter Johnson (born January 8, 1969) is a freelance American game designer, author, and translator. He has translated many game rules and websites from German for Mayfair Games. He has authored or co-authored six books for Steve Jackson Games, including "GURPS Monsters" and "GURPS Japan" and designed two games for White Wolf Publishing, including gToons, which proved popular among children on Cartoon Network's "Cartoon Orbit" children's website and left an impact on how such websites use digital trading cards for online gaming.
History.
J. Hunter Johnson was born January 8, 1969, in Wichita, Kansas. At age ten, he was introduced to "Dungeons &amp; Dragons". That, combined with an exposure to Isaac Asimov and John M. Ford at the local library, led to his love of role-playing games.
In 1988, he was introduced to "GURPS" and became an active on USENET. While working on a list of "GURPS" supplements, he was contacted by Steve Jackson Games for some corrections. This eventually led to a job as the first coordinator of "GURPS" errata which he stayed at for five years. During his time at Steve Jackson Games, Johnson authored, co-authored, or contributed to seven books (see "Bibliography" below) for the company's "GURPS" role-playing game. He also served as development coordinator for the company's "Knightmare Chess" 2nd edition card game.
After leaving Steve Jackson Games, Johnson worked for White Wolf Publishing, where he designed gToons for the programmers at Cartoon Network. Prior to the introduction of gToons, the Cartoon Network's website, "Cartoon Orbit", had implemented a system of offering collectible digital trading cards (called cToons) and providing a means of trading them with other users of the website. Introduced in October 2002, "Cartoon Orbit's" gToons took the digital trading cards concept and made it into a game, using new gToons cards, where website users could play each other head-to-head.
In 2013, Johnson had teamed up with a new development and business partner, Sebastian Chedal, and the pair introduced a new online game, called Quizgle.com. The original concept was Chedal's. "He does the interfacing and I have a background in database. He was looking for someone to do the back end of it," said Johnson in a 2013 interview. The game's interface displays results of a simulated web search, and the player tries to guess the search terms used to get the results shown. The game's online legal page describes the game as a tribute to Google while disclaiming any affiliation with them. The site reads, "Quizgle is a tribute to that daily experience we all share when we pull up our favorite search engine to ask the world a question." In June 2013, Johnson and Chedal were working on improvements in the game. As of August 2014, the game was still in beta, though some of the planned improvements had been implemented.
Reception of Johnson's works.
Johnson authored or co-authored several books for Steve Jackson Games. One of these books, "GURPS Monsters", won a rating of A in a review published in "Games Unplugged". John G. Snyder of gamingreport.com rated the book at 4 1/2 stars, saying, "You will be pleasantly surprised and not a little disturbed." Freelance writer Craig Oxbrow says in a 2001 review of the book for rpg.net, "GURPS Monsters is a wealth of ideas and inspiration for monsters as characters," and that it "will see use beyond the GURPS system." Kenneth Hite from Out of the Box reviewed Johnson's book "GURPS Japan: beauty, terror, and adventure, 2nd ed." in 1999, concluding that "medieval Japan, broadly defined, is suddenly one of the most solidly playable milieux in gaming."
Johnson's gToons game proved popular among children, with more than 250,000 registered online users within the first month after the game's launch. The game was introduced in 2002, when the growth of Cartoon Network's website ("Cartoon Orbit") traffic was far outpacing the Internet in general, yet the website was still lagging behind Nickelodeon. "Cartoon Orbit" was the first children's TV website to introduce digital trading cards related to their programming in 2000, but Nickelodeon surpassed them with a similar approach six months later. gToons was intended to help "Cartoon Orbit" regain their lead in internet traffic among children. After looking at early usage data for the game, Cartoon Network's Justin Williams commented, "Competition really is just as much of a community-builder as collaboration." Three months after gToons was released, Cartoon Network executives were planning spin-off products and merchandising from the game. At that same time, Nickelodeon announced that it too would also be launching games based on its digital trading cards. MIT professor Henry Jenkins said in an interview with USA Today regarding online card games associated with children's TV networks, "what Cartoon and Nick are doing is just an extension of the Pokémon phenomenon."
In a 2013 review of the beta version of Quizgle.com, freelance writer Danielle Coots wrote "With its innovative mind challengers, it is sure to have its visitors stumped at times." She further described the game as "cool, clever, and fun," and also "easy to navigate."

<doc id="7030067" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7030067" title="Exercise book">
Exercise book

An exercise book or composition book is a notebook that is used in schools to copy down schoolwork and notes. A student will usually have different exercise books for each separate lesson or subject.
The exercise book format is different for some subjects: for the majority of subjects, the exercise book will contain lined paper with a margin, but for other subjects such as mathematics, the exercise book will contain squared paper to aid in the drawing of graphs, tables or other diagrams.
Exercise books may act as a primary record of students' learning efforts. For younger pupils, books are often collected at the end of each lesson for review, scoring, or grading. Loose worksheets may be pasted into the book so that they are bound with other work.
In some schools, exercise books may be colour-coded depending on the subject. For example, biology might be green and algebra blue.
The exercise book was also called "version book" historically, and is called "khata" in India, "scribbler" in Canada, " jotter" in Scotland, and "copy book" in Ireland. The US equivalent is "composition book", which traditionally has a distinctive cover pattern.
Size.
Australia.
The traditional size of a school exercise book in Australia is , which may be approximated by B5 (176 × 250 mm). Larger A4 (previously foolscap) notebooks are also very commonly used.
Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Exercise books manufactured in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are labeled by three-digit codes that encode their size, number of pages, and ruling.
The first numeral stands for the size:
The second numeral stands for the number of pages:
The third numeral stands for the ruling:
Ireland.
"Copy books" sold in Ireland usually come with 32, 40, 88, or 120 pages. The pages can be blank, ruled, and/or squared.
New Zealand.
School exercise books in New Zealand generally conform to standard NZS 8132:1984 (Specification for school stationery). An alphanumeric code is used to describe the exercise book's binding, format, and size.
The first numerals(s) refer to the binding:
The letter refers to the format:
The last numeral refers to the size:
Russia.
The most common Russian exercise notebooks, codified in the Russian industry standard, are:
Other sizes and number of sheets are permitted. The preferable sizes are (in mm): 210 x 297 (A4), 203 x 288, 203 x 275, 170 x 203, 148 x 210 (A5), 144 x 203.
"Thin" notebooks must be either ruled with 8 mm spacing between the lines, or graph-ruled with 5 mm or 7 mm squares. "Thick" notebooks must be either ruled with 6 mm, 7 mm, 8 mm, 9 mm spacing between the lines, or graph-ruled with 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, or 7 mm squares.
The paper for cursive writing uses pairs of lines 4 mm apart, with 8 mm between the pairs. They may also have angled lines at 65 degrees to vertical to provide additional guidance.
The lines can have gray, blue, green, or purple colour. The vertical margin line must have a red or orange color. Vertical margin is optional for graph-ruled notebooks.
United Kingdom.
There are three commonly used sizes of exercise book in the UK: A5 (148×210 mm), A4 (210×297 mm), and 178×229 mm (approximately 7″×9″, based on a traditional size used before the UK adopted ISO 216 paper sizes). They usually come with 32, 48, 64, or 80 pages which can be plain, ruled, or squared.
In Scotland, exercise books are commonly known as "jotters".
United States.
In the United States, exercise books used by writers and students are known as "composition books". Although available in several colors, the original marbled black-and-white cover, with its generic label on the front, is the most common. Typically, they have dimensions of or and 20, 40, 80 or 100 sheets.
Composition books can be ruled or graphed.
The papers in a composition book often have the baseline and cap line printed in blue to aid writing, with a (sometimes red) vertical line for a margin on the left hand of every page. Traditionally, the inside back cover contains a table of the weights and measures of the English (imperial) system printed for reference; however, this feature has become less common in countries that have adopted the metric system. Sometimes a multiplication table, or grammar or punctuation tips, are also found on the inside back cover. The inside front cover typically has a place to put one's weekly class schedule.
Composition books are traditionally bound through the fold—that is, the pages are folded, and stitched vertically along the fold. This allows to open them completely flat, simplifying writing on the left side, and also makes them significantly more durable than loose leaf pads or spiral notebooks.
Exercise books with fewer sheets, such as Blue books, are used in many post-secondary schools during assessment tests.

Heeswijk Castle

Heeswijk Castle () is a moated castle near Heeswijk in the Dutch province of North Brabant.
Location.
Heeswijk Castle was built on a meander of the small River Aa. The 20th century canalized Aa now flows at some distance of the Castle. However, in the early decades of the 21st century the original bed of the Aa closer to the castle, was restored and now gets enough water. The Aa was crucial for transporting heavy goods between 's-Hertogenbosch and Helmond, and perhaps even somewhat higher upstream. This gave an economic reason to build the castle on the river. On the other hand, the Aa was a barrier for east–west movement, especially by armies. This also gave the castle a strategic position, which it would keep for centuries.
The Building.
The main castle has been built on top of an old motte. In the cellar there is a loam layer containing fragments of bog iron and tuff, remnants of the first castle. There are also 14th century wall fragments visible in the cellars. Here the outer walls reach a thickness of three meters. Aboveground most of the main castle is 15th and 16th century, but the semi-circular form of the older parts still betrays its motte origin. The old part has two round towers on the corners, and one old overhanging tower. The bridge leading to the inner courtyard ends on the base of a disappeared square gate tower.
The big round tower, the gallery connected to it, and the armory to which the gallery connects are all nineteenth century additions. This is also the case for the round tower pasted to the eastern façade. Nevertheless, the big tower was built on top of older foundation. Therefore, these additions probably did not enlarge the ground plan of the castle that much, even though they may have made it more square.
The outer bailey is a fine example of sixteenth century construction. It was built of alternating rows of brick and stone, creating a striped façade. It also has nice features like stepped gables and cross-windows. The bailey is surrounded a wall in the same striped façade style.
History.
Medieval times.
The original motte-and-bailey castle was erected in 1080. The first mentioned Lord of Heeswijk was Amelricus van Heeswijk mentioned in the twelfth century. Later that century a Hubertus van Heeswijk was mentioned.
In the thirteenth the Lords that gave their name to the castle were succeeded by Walraven of Bentheim from the family of the Counts of Bentheim. Walraven was still alive in 1308. That year Count Jan of Megen was in control of the lordship, and he remained so till his death in about 1346. After that Jan van Bentheim grandson of Walraven, became Lord of Heeswijk.
In a 1359 act Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg and his wife Joanna, Duchess of Brabant declared that Heeswijk and half of Dinther were within Brabant, but that Jan van Benthem had joined the war against County of Flanders voluntarily. That is, his goods were allod, i.e. not on loan from anybody. (The other half of Dinther was owned by Jan van Berlaer, Lord of Helmond). Such a voluntary involvement did create enemies, and in 1371 and 1372 Heeswijk Castle was attacked by Guelders and the Duchy of Jülich.
Jan van Benthem could maintain himself in Heeswijk, and so he 'sold' to Knight Dirk de Rover in 1374. Walraven of Bentheim son of Jan regained the estate in 1379, and so the transaction might not have been a final sale. Walraven sold the lordship to Willem van der Aa.
Willem van der Aa was schepen of 's-Hertogenbosch in 1388, 1392 and 1401. He was also a knight, and Lord of Nieuw-Herlaer Castle. He fought in the 1371 Battle of Baesweiler, and was captured and ransomed during that war. In 1387 he made the Lordship of Heeswijk and half of Dinther a loan of Brabant, and then also received the other half of Dinther. In 1398 Guelders troops burned down the villages of Heeswijk and Dinther, but could not conquer the castle. Willem van der Aa sold the Lordship of Heeswijk and Dinther in 1405. By 1409 he was dead.
Knight Hendrick van der Lek (1354–1427) would become the next lord. His father was the influential John II, Lord of Polanen (c. 1325–1378). As a younger son Hendrick did not succeed to the main part of his father's estate, which included the Lordship of Breda. In 1401 he was imprisoned by the citizens of 's-Hertogenbosch. It led to a conflict which ended with the Duchess paying a ransom for him. In 1405 Hendrick bought Heeswijk and Dinther. Hendrick became Hofmeister of John IV, Duke of Brabant. He also fought for his master, and was a member of the Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady in 's-Hertogenbosch. Hendrick first married Maria of Diest, which marriage remained childless. He next married Joanna of Ghistelles.
Hendrick van der Lek had two daughters by Joanna of Ghistelles. The oldest, Jeanne became Lady of Heeswijk and Dinther in 1427. She married Jan van Cuyck Lord of Hoogstraten. Jeanne did without offspring in 1454 and was buried in 's-Hertogenbosch. The younger daughter Elselina married Eustache de Bousies lord of Vertaing, Feluy, Gosselies, Rommeries etc. in 1446.
Their second son Pieter de Bousies lord of Vertaing would inherit all of his aunt Jeanne's estate. In 1471 he was appointed as high schout of 's-Hertogenbosch and the Meierij, but his investment was prevented by him not having been born in the Meierij. In 1473 he married for the second time, to Margaretha of Culemborg heiress of Jan van Culemborg Lord of Boxmeer and Spalbeek. Pieter led the militia of 's-Hertogenbosch in many wars against Guelders. In one of these he died near Heerewaarden on 22 April 1479.
Margaretha of Culemborg, widow of Pieter de Bousies remarried to Willem van Egmond Stadholder of Guelders. Their daughter Anna brought Boxmeer, Haps, Stevensweert and Spalbeek to the Counts of 's-Heerenberg by marrying Willem III van den Bergh. The property of Pieter de Bousies could did not move with his widow, but was inherited by his sisters: Margaretha, Anthonia, Johanna and Isabella. The first three sisters died as a member of a religious order. In 1485 the Count of Oettingen became lord of Heeswijk and Dinther on account of his wife being a daughter of Isabella.
16th century.
Cornelis of Glymes called 'De Berges' (1458-1508/1509) Lord of Zevenbergen became the next lord by purchase in 1499. Cornelis fought in the Battle of Tienen in 1482. He was the Hofmeister of Philip the Fair, and became a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1500. In 1513 Cornelis became governor of Grave. He also became lord of Melun and Grevenbroeck. He married Maria Magdalena van Strijen lady of Zevenbergen, Noordeloos, Heemskerk and Capelle aan de IJssel. All of which were added to his estate.
After the death of Cornelis de Glymes most of his estate went to his sons, and finally his younger sister Maria de Glymes married to Louis de Ligne Baron of Barbançon. The Lordship of Heeswijk and Dinther first went to Cornelis' oldest son Maximilian. He was invested in December 1509. During his rule the Guelders army invaded and burned the area in 1512–1513, but did not succeed in capturing Heeswijk Castle.
Maximilian was succeeded by his brother Leonard de Glymes, who became lord in 1521. He died in 1523 and was succeeded by his younger brother Corneille of Berghes (1490?-1560?), prince bishop of Liège in 1538. Corneille sold Heeswijk and Dinther in 1555 to Johan I of East Frisia, a non-ruling count of that house. For 60,000 guilders the count also got: a watermill in Middelrooy and a windmill in Schijndel with the farm of Veerdonc and others.
Johan married Dorothea of Austria (1516–1572) a bastard of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, heiress of Falkenburg, Durbuy and Halem, lady in waiting to Queen Maria of Hungary.
The Eighty Years' War.
The Eighty Years' War reached the environs on 's-Hertogenbosch in 1572-1573 when first Gorinchem and Zaltbommel, and then Geertruidenberg joined the Dutch Republic. In 1578 Heeswijk Castle got a Republican garrison of 20 men under Jaques de Wale. The mighty fortress 's-Hertogenbosch finally joined the Spanish side in 1579. For the defense of the countryside it then had to rely on a string of castles and sconces and a few small cities. Heeswijk Castle had switched sides by the end of 1579, and was one of these.
Maximilian of Ostfriesland (1553-1591?), son of Johan and Dorothea became lord of Heeswijk and Dinther in 1574. Maximilian was governor and captain-general of Luxembourg. He married Barabara de Lalaing, sister of the stadholder of Groningen. Maximilian at first succeeded in taking responsibility for Heeswijk's defense. He had a son Werner and a daughter named Dorothea. Werner succeeded his father. He was married to Johanna of Merode Houfalize. in 1599 the governor of 's-Hertogenbosch took command of the castle.
On 1 November 1601 the army of Maurice of Nassau appeared before Heeswijk Castle. As usual the garrison was summoned to surrender. The subsequent refusal to surrender was kind of exceptional for a castle. An assault followed, but was repealed. A few days later the castle was found to be deserted. This was not so strange, because the garrison could not expect quarter after this. In the end 's-Hertogenbosch and Heeswijk stayed on the Spanish sided till the 1609 truce.
Near the end of the Twelve Years' Truce (1609-1621) new rulers were appointed at Heeswijk. Werner of Ostfriesland died in 1620, and left only a bastard Maria. His sister Dorothea married lieutenant general James 't Serclaes (?-1624) older brother of Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly and got Jan Werner. Jan Werner 't Serclaes Count of Tilly, Bannerman of Marbaix, Lord of Montigny (?-1668) became the next Lord of Heeswijk and Dinther in 1621. Maria of Ostfriesland, the bastard of Werner also acceded in 1621.
In 1629 Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange captured Heeswijk Castle and 's-Hertogenbosch. Maria of Ostfriesland married Hendrik van den Berg, and died in 1633. Jan Werner 't Serclaes then also succeeded to her part in 1633. He became the prime heir to his famous uncle. On 14 March 1633 Jan Werner married Maria Françoise de Montmorency, but the next generation of the Tilly's would not get Heeswijk, in 1647 it was sold.
17th and 18th century.
On 20 April 1647 Dirk van Cattenburgh, presiding schepen of 's-Hertogenbosch and Joost van Hedickhuysen, Lord of Eckart bought the Lordship of Heeswijk and Dinther. Dirk had been schepen of 's-Hertogenbosch 1640-1643 and in 1646 he became presiding schepen. He died in 1653. Joost van Hedickhuysen was of unknown origin. He lived at close by Seldensate Manor, but died already in October 1647.
Jonkheer Matthijs van Asperen, captain in the Dutch army then bought Heeswijk and Dinther in 1649 and became the official lord in May 1650. Matthijs later became a colonel and commander of 's-Hertogenbosch. In 1655 he gave a guarantee on Heeswijk to his creditor Geraert Maes, a jeweller from The Hague. In 1672 the French king Louis XIV stayed at Heeswijk Castle during his campaign against the Dutch Republic. Geraert Maes' widow Elisabeth Lasson became the next proprietor in 1679. In 1684 Jacobus van der Hoeven succeeded to Heeswijk. He married Agatha Briel, related to the Van Beresteyn's (cf. Maurick Castle) and died in 1691. His widow succeeded. In 1699 their son Jacob van der Hoeven became Lord of Heeswijk. He was in turn succeeded by his son Jacob, who became lord in 1719 and who died in 1739.
Mr. Cornelis Speelman became the next lord in 1740, because he had married Jacob's sister Agatha van der Hoeven in 1716. Cornelis was a grandson of Cornelis Speelman (1628-1684), Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Cornelis became schepen in 's-Hertogenbosch, and died in 1746. He was succeeded by mr. Jacob Speelman (1722-1787), who made an impressive career in Leiden. In 1788 he was succeeded by his son mr. Cornelis Jacob Speelman (1747-1825). During his tenure the French general Pichegru used the castle as his headquarters. The French period also meant the abolition of the feudal rights. Cornelis Jacob was succeeded by his son Abraham Florentius (1784-1840), but in 1834 the family sold their property in Heeswijk and Dinther.
Collector Baron van den Bogaerde van Terbrugge.
In 1834, Baron Andreas van den Bogaerde van Terbrugge, governor of North Brabant, bought Heeswijk Castle, which by then had fallen into disrepair. He immediately started reconstruction works on a large scale. The castle was also enlarged with an armory. He also added the so-called 'Iron Tower'. Here the growing collection of art objects and curiosities collected by the baron and his sons, Louis and Donat was stored. In 1836 Van den Bogaerde van Terbrugge and six others founded the , a society that would grow to become the Noordbrabants Museum.
The Museum.
The castle was restored in 2005. The current castle museum attempts to reflect the life and traditions of the middle of the 19th century. Following the recent restorations, guided tours of the castle are offered.
The armory of the castle is used as a wedding location by the municipality Bernheze. Under the promenade cellar roofs (wedding) receptions can be held and the carriage house of the castle accommodates training facilities as well as congress and presentation rooms.

Dzmitry Zavadski

Dmitry Alexandrovich Zavadsky () or Dzmitry Aliaksandravich Zavadski (; 28 August 1972 – declared dead 3 December 2003) was a Belarusian journalist who disappeared and was presumably murdered in 2000. Zavadsky worked as journalist and cameraman for Russian Public Television Channel One (ORT). From 1994 to 1997, he was the personal cameraman of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
1997 border-crossing incident.
In 1997, Zavadsky and ORT reporter Pavel Sheremet were arrested and imprisoned after filming a report about security vulnerability on the Belarus–Lithuania border. Zavadsky filmed the report with Sheremet (along with his drivers) crossing illegally from Belarus to Lithuania and back again, to demonstrate the ease with which smugglers could cross the border. They were charged with Article 17 of the Criminal Code (conspiracy to commit a crime) and Article 80 (intentional violation of the state border), which carried a maximum five-year prison sentence.
The arrests resulted in a diplomatic fallout between Russia and Belarus. The Russian authorities criticized Belarus over the arrests and Russian President Boris Yeltsin cancelled Lukashenko's scheduled trip to Moscow in protest. Lukashenko's invitation was revoked after he had already left Belarus; his plane was denied access to enter Russian airspace.
The trial began on 17 December 1997 in Ashmyany, from the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. The selection of the location was highly publicized in both Belarus and Russia. Ashmyany, as a border city, required special permission to access, which complicated the situation for journalists wishing to cover the case. Additionally, the courtroom was too small to accommodate all the interested parties, but the request to transfer the trial to a larger location was denied.
Sheremet and Zavadsky were represented by Belarusian public defenders and Russian attorney Viktor Kuznetsov from ORT. Their attorneys argued there was no evidence of any crime, as the only evidence they had crossed the border illegally was a sign Zavadsky filmed reading "Republic of Lithuania" that is technically located in Belarus. The attorneys accused the state of arresting the journalists not for any crime but for the fact that they criticized the border security. Attorney Mikhail Pastukhov urged the court to seek "justice, not violence."
On 28 January 1998, the court found Sheremet and Zavadsky guilty on all charges. Sheremet and Zavadsky were sentenced to 36 months in prison, but their sentences were suspended.
Disappearance.
From October 1999 to May 2000, Zavadsky and Sheremet were in Chechnya filming "Chechen Diary", a four-part documentary series for ORT.
On 7 July 2000, Zavadsky drove to the Minsk National Airport to meet Sheremet. Witnesses saw Zavadsky in the airport and his car was later found in the parking lot. Zavadsky has not been seen since.
Zavadsky had received threatening phone calls before his disappearance, and his neighbors saw two men trailing him near his apartment building on the day he disappeared. The witnesses helped police artist compile composite drawings of the two men, but the police refused to release them to the public.
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, its sources in Belarus suspect that Zavadsky was murdered because he had footage showing Belarusian security agents fighting in Chechnya alongside Chechen rebels.
Belarusian officials, including Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Mikhail Udovikov, suggested that Zavadsky was abducted either by his colleagues at ORT, including Sheremet, or by members of the local opposition, related to his "pro-Russia" coverage of the Chechen war.
On 20 November 2000, independent Belarusian media received an anonymous email from a person who identified himself as an officer of the Belarus State Security Committee working on the Zavadsky investigation:
"The writer claimed that nine suspects had been arrested, seven of whom were either current or former officers of the Presidential Security Service, and that the suspects had confessed to killing Zavadsky and had named the place where his body was buried. According to the e-mail, the investigators had also found a shovel stained with Zavadsky's blood. Additionally, the e-mail claimed that President Lukashenko refused to allow investigators to exhume the body, and that the case was later transferred from the Prosecutor's Office to the Interior Ministry to sabotage the investigation." — report from Committee to Protect Journalists
The following day, Lukashenko blamed Zavadsky's disappearance on Chechen kidnappers. A week later, Lukashenko fired four of his top officials: his security issues adviser, the chairman of the Security Council, the prosecutor general, and the head of the State Security Committee. Lukashenko asserted that the four had been plotting a "coup d'état" and had abducted Zavadsky to implicate the president.
Trial.
On 14 March 2002, Minsk Regional Court convicted four men of five murders, plus the kidnapping of Dmitry Zavadsky. Two of the men, Valery Ignatovich and Maxim Malik, were former members of the elite Belarusian police unit Almaz. Despite the conviction, Zavadsky's body was never recovered and the circumstances of his disappearance and ultimate fate were not explained.
In addition to Zavadsky, Belarusian authorities failed to determine the fates of leading opposition figures Yury Zakharanka and Viktar Hanchar, and businessman Anatol Krasouski, who also disappeared in 1999 and 2000.
Belarus came under international criticism and human rights monitors regarded the behind-closed-doors trial and convictions as flawed. Journalists were banned from observing the proceedings except for the sentencing. In September 2002, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe stated that it was “seriously concerned about the lack of progress” and established an investigative sub-committee to probe into the multiple “disappearances.”
Subsequent investigations and fallout.
In December 2003, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe alleged that top government officials were involved in the disappearances and subsequent cover-ups. In 2004, the assembly filed a resolution calling for Belarus to initiate a proper criminal investigation into the disappearances, and stated that until "significant process" was made in the cases, it would not reconsider its 1997 suspension of Belarus as a guest member of the council.
In September 2004, the European Union and the United States issued travel bans for fоur Belarusian officials suspected in being involved in the kidnapping of Zavadsky: Interior Affairs Minister Vladimir Naumov, Prosecutor General Viktor Sheiman, Minister for Sports and Tourism Yuri Sivakov, and Colonel Dmitry Pavlichenko from the Belarus Interior Ministry. Naumov had been tasked with leading the investigation despite suspicions he was directly involved. Greece denied Sivakov a visa to prevent him from attending the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
Belarusian officials have twice re-opened the investigation into Zavadsky's disappearance—in 2003 and 2005—but no further details have been released about his whereabouts.
In 2007, the U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC) denied Belarus a seat on after heavy international criticism of the country's poor human rights and press freedom record, including the disappearances of the four men and the 2005 murder of Veronika Cherkasova.
Legacy.
In 2004, his wife, Sviatlana Zavadskaya, and Iryna Krasouskaya, the wife of Anatol Krasouski, co-founded the We Remember Foundation, dedicated to bringing justice to the disappeared and exposing human rights violations in Belarus.

Đuro Ferić

Đuro Ferić, also Giorgio Ferrich, (May 5, 1739 – 1820) was a poet and a Jesuit vicar general of the Republic of Ragusa. 
As a poet, he belonged to the Illyrian circle in Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia). Illyrian (Slavic) was synonymous with the Croatian language at that time. His Latin-language collection of Illyrian fables, published in Ragusa in 1794, bore the title "Fabulae ab Illyricis adagiis disumptae", and a second similar text, existing only in manuscript, was titled: "Adagia illirycae linguae fabulis explicata". An unpublished collection of his own Slavic poems was titled in Latin: "Slavica Poematia Latine reddita".
In the second decade of the 19th century he published in Ragusa two further works in Croatian (Slovinski). Ferić put together a collection of short poems in praise of those Ragusan poets who wrote in the Illyrian language, such as Dominko Zlatarić's translation of "Sophocles" and Ivan Gundulić's "Osman".

In 1996, he captured a Corn Uí Mhuirí winners' medal as the Killorglin school captured the Munster colleges' title. An All-Ireland colleges' final appearance beckoned for Russell's side with St Patrick's of Maghera providing the opposition. Killorglin went on a goal scoring spree and proved more than a match for the point-scoring abilities of St Pat's. A 4-8 to 1-14 score line gave Killorglin the win and gave Russell an All-Ireland colleges' winners' medal.
Russell currently works as a teacher in Mercy Holy Cross primary school in Killarney. In 2009, he married Sinead O'Brien in Killorglin.
Playing career.
College.
Russell attended the Institute of Technology, Tralee (ITT), where he lined out with the institute's senior football team and enjoyed some success. In the 1997–98 season, his side reached the final of the inter-varsities football competition. The University of Ulster provided the opposition on that occasion in Austin Stack Park; however, ITT won the game by 0-10 to 0-8, giving Russell a Sigerson Cup winners' medal.
Inter-county.
Russell made his debut for Kerry in the 1997 season. He became a key forward for Kerry over the next decade, winning a total of five All-Ireland medals with Kerry. He was also selected for the All-Star team in 2000. He retired from inter-county football in 2009. Went to New York for summer 2009 to play for Roscommon New York who won the Championship

Bill Coleman (trumpeter)

William Johnson Coleman (August 4, 1904 in Paris, Kentucky, United States – August 24, 1981 in Toulouse, France) was an American jazz trumpeter.
Early life.
In 1909, Coleman's family moved from Kentucky to Cincinnati. His first musical explorations were on clarinet and C melody saxophone, but he eventually settled on trumpet. As a young man he worked as a messenger for the Western Union telegraph company. He studied with Cincinnati trumpeter Theodore Carpenter, and played in an amateur band led by trombonist J.C. Higginbotham.
Career.
Coleman began professional work in Cincinnati with bands led by Clarence Paige and Wesley Helvey (both bands his teacher Carpenter worked in) then with Lloyd and Cecil Scott. In December 1927, he traveled with the Scott brothers to New York City, and continued to work with them until the late summer of 1929, when he joined the orchestra of pianist Luis Russell. His first recording session was with Russell on September 6, 1929, and he soloed on the tune "Feelin' the Spirit". By December 1929, he had left Russell (partly due to the majority of the solo work going to section mate Henry "Red" Allen), but re-joined the band on two more occasions during 1931–32.
He rejoined the Scott brothers (then known as Cecil Scott's Bright Boys) in late 1929, participating in a Victor recording session, and continued to work with them through the early part of 1930. He worked with various New York based bands until rejoining Luis Russell in 1931.
His first trip to Europe was with the band of Lucky Millinder from June until October 1933, after which he returned to New York to work with bandleaders Benny Carter and Teddy Hill, whom he recorded with in early 1935. While with the Hill band he participated in a freelance recording session with pianist Fats Waller, waxing a number of sides.
Coleman returned to Cincinnati briefly in the summer of 1935, then headed to Europe, playing a residency in Paris with entertainer/vocalist Freddy Taylor (whom he had worked with in the Lucky Millinder band). While in Paris, he recorded with guitarist Django Reinhardt and made several freelance sessions under his own name. In late 1936, he traveled to Bombay, India, playing with Leon Abbey's Orchestra, then back to Paris in April 1937, joining the band led by American-born saxophonist William T. Lewis (the band known as Willie Lewis and his Entertainers).
After a sojourn to Cairo, Egypt, Coleman returned to the U.S. in March 1940, and worked throughout the 1940s with a variety of top groups including bands led by Benny Carter (1940), Teddy Wilson (1940–41), Andy Kirk (1941–42), Ellis Larkins (1943), Mary Lou Williams (1944), John Kirby (1945), Sy Oliver (1946–47), and Billy Kyle (1947–48). During this same time, Coleman participated in many recording sessions with top jazz stars such as Lester Young, Billie Holiday and Coleman Hawkins.
He returned to France in 1948 and spent the rest of his life there, in part due to wishing to avoid racial segregation. Like many American musicians, he felt he received the recognition he deserved from European audiences, and during the decades he lived in France he traveled and performed in clubs and concert venues all over Europe. In 1978, he performed at the first Jazz in Marciac festival (along with tenor saxophonist Guy Lafitte), later becoming an honorary president of the festival organization.
In 1974, he received the Ordre National du Mérite. His autobiography, called "Trumpet Story" and translated into French by his wife, Lily, was published in 1981 (Cana éditions). The English version was published in 1989 by Palgrave-Macmillan, UK. Another version, including many original photographs, was published by Mémoires d'Oc éditions in 2004, and entitled "De Paris (Kentucky) à Paris (France), ma trompette sous le bras" ("From Paris (Kentucky) to Paris (France), with my trumpet under my arm").
Playing style.
From his first solo on record with the Luis Russell Orchestra, Coleman's playing exhibited a lighter sound more akin to Jabbo Smith than Louis Armstrong, yet his phrasing is more in the Armstrong vein than that of Smith. In many respects his playing was stylistically related to the playing by other swing era trumpeters such as Roy Eldridge and Buck Clayton.

Voisin Canard

The Voisin Canard was an aircraft developed by the Voisin brothers during 1910 and first flown early in 1911. It was named the "Canard" because of the resemblance of its forward fuselage to that of a duck's long neck while in flight. It was originally flown as a landplane: with the addition of floats it became one of the first seaplanes used by the French Navy.
Design and development.
The Canard was, even by the standards of 1910, a curiously regressive design, its layout reminiscent of Alberto Santos-Dumont's 14-bis of 1906.
As first flown at Issy-les-Moulineaux by , the aircraft had an uncovered fuselage of wire-braced wood construction with the Rossel-Peugeot rotary engine at the rear and the front-mounted control surfaces consisting of an all-moving elevator divided into two halves, one either side of the fuselage, a rectangular balanced rudder mounted above the elevator, and a pair of short-span fixed horizontal surfaces with a high angle of attack mounted behind and below the elevators. Voisin's characteristic side-curtains were fitted to the outermost pair of interplane struts and roll control was achieved using trailing-edge ailerons on both upper and lower wings.
The aircraft was judged a success and Voisin manufactured a number of examples. There are variations between the individual production aircraft: the two examples flown in the French military aircraft trials in 1911 had a wingspan of .; one was powered by a Renault and the second by a Gnome. The number of sets of side curtains varied, some aircraft having two or even three sets.
Seaplane version.
The seaplane variant, fitted with floats designed by Henri Fabre, was initially built to the order of Prince Bibesco, who intended to use it make a flight across the Black Sea. It was first successfully flown from water on 25 April 1911.
One example was bought by the French navy in March 1912 to equip the seaplane tender "La Foudre", the first seaplane carrier in history. A second example was delivered to the Navy in December 1913.

Spiritual Unity

Spiritual Unity is a studio album by American free jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler. It was recorded on July 10, 1964 in New York City, and features bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray. It was the first album recorded for Bernard Stollman's ESP-Disk label, and it brought Ayler to international attention as it was so "shockingly different". At the same time, it transformed ESP-DISK into "a major source for avant-garde jazz". A 5-star review in AllMusic called it a "landmark recording that's essential to any basic understanding of free jazz", "the album that pushed Albert Ayler to the forefront of jazz's avant-garde... really the first available document of Ayler's music that matched him with a group of truly sympathetic musicians", and stated that "the results are a magnificently pure distillation of his aesthetic."
Background.
In late December 1963, Bernard Stollman, who had been toying with the idea of starting a record label, went, at the insistence of a friend, to hear Ayler at the Baby Grand Café on 125th Street in Harlem. Ayler had moved to New York City earlier in the year, and had recently been playing with a variety of musicians, including Ornette Coleman, with whom Ayler made an informal recording earlier that month, and Cecil Taylor, with whom he would perform on New Years Eve on a concert at Philharmonic Hall, Lincoln Center that would also feature the John Coltrane quintet and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. According to Stollman, upon arriving at the Baby Grand Cafe,
Elmo Hope was at the piano, with his trio, on an elevated stage. I sat and listened to them. Several minutes later, a small man in a gray leather suit, holding a large saxophone, brushed by me and jumped up on the stage. He had a black beard, with a little patch of white in it. He was not introduced and, ignoring the trio, he began to blow his horn. The other musicians stopped and looked at him. No words were exchanged. Elmo Hope quietly closed his piano, the bass player parked his bass, the drummer put his sticks down, and they all sat back to listen. He was playing solo, and he kept right on playing for twenty to thirty minutes, just a burst of music. It seemed like a second; it was no time at all! Then he stopped and jumped down from the platform, covered with sweat.
Stollman then approached Ayler, told him he was starting a record label, and asked him to be his first artist, offering a $500 advance. Ayler agreed, and stated that he would contact Stollman after fulfulling a commitment to record material at Atlantic Studios. (Here he was referring to the February 24, 1964 session that yielded two albums, "Spirits", later reissued as "Witches &amp; Devils", and "Swing Low Sweet Spiritual".)
In early 1964, Ayler briefly joined a quartet led by Paul Bley. This occasion introduced Ayler to bassist Gary Peacock, who had been playing with Bley for several years, and who had also recently recorded with Bill Evans. Bley's group also included drummer Sunny Murray, with whom Ayler had played in Cecil Taylor's group. (Murray was featured on both of Ayler's February 24 recordings.) The Bley quartet did not record, and made only one public appearance at the Take 3 coffeehouse in Greenwich Village. By late spring, Ayler, Peacock, and Murray had formed a trio, after Peacock left Miles Davis' group, where he was substituting for Ron Carter. On June 14, the trio played at the Cellar Café in New York City and recorded the material that would be released on the album "Prophecy", which features some of the pieces that would be recorded for "Spiritual Unity" less than a month later.
Recording and release.
That same month, Ayler called Stollman and told him he would like to make a recording. According to Val Wilmer, Ayler's decision to join Stollman's label, which would be called ESP-Disk, was made "against the advice of Cecil Taylor and other musicians who thought that artists should hold out for a price commensurate with their talent." Ayler justified his decision, stating: "I felt my art was so important that I had to get it out. At that time I was musically out of this world. I knew I had to play this music for the people."
Stollman booked a session for July 10 at Variety Arts Studio, a small and inexpensive studio near Times Square which had been used frequently by Moe Asch, the owner of Folkways Records, for whom Stollman had done legal work. Stollman recalled:
Just before 1 PM, Sunny Murray arrived, a large, genial walrus, moving and speaking with an easy agility that belied his appearance. Gary Peacock was next, tall, thin, ascetic looking, and soft spoken, with an introspective and kindly demeanor. Albert Ayler was last, small, wary and laconic.
The recording engineer left the studio door open, and Stollman and Peacock's then-wife Annette sat in the reception area. According to Stollman,
As the music played, I was enthralled, exhilarated, jubilant. I exchanged glances with Annette and said, "What an auspicious beginning for a record label!" She nodded her head in agreement.
At one point, "the engineer fled the control room for a few minutes, but returned in time to change the tape for the next selection". Although the session was well-miked, Stollman was "horrified" to learn that it had been recorded monaurally. However, years later he stated: "In forty-plus years, no one has ever cared". The musicians were paid and signed recording agreements after the session, in a nearby cafe.
Stollman hired Jordan Matthews, formerly a producer for ABC, as his art director, and Matthews brought in Howard Bernstein to do the cover art. Stollman stated that he decided to silk-screen the cover, lending it "a primal quality, suitable for ESP". Despite the fact that it was the first true ESP-Disk recording, "Spiritual Unity" was released in 1965 as the second item in the label's catalog, following a record titled "Ni Kantu En Esperanto", which Stollman described as "just an exercise" resulting from his interest in Esperanto. (Stollman recalled that when he recorded the Esperanto album, he "had no thoughts of doing anything beyond that".)
Early releases of "Spiritual Unity" contained a booklet titled "Ayler - Peacock - Murray - You and the Night and the Music" with text by Paul Haines. The album liner notes state that the symbol "Y" that appears on the back cover "pre-dates recorded history and has always represented the rising spirit of man. We thought the sign particularly apt for this album." The booklet has never been included in any CD reissue, but it was included in the "Holy Ghost" box set.
Ayler was pleased with the recording, and felt that it represented a very high level of musical interaction, stating: "Most people would have thought this impossible but it actually happened. The most important thing is to stay in tune with each other but it takes spiritual people to do this... We weren't "playing", we were listening to each other." Following its release, Ayler sent a copy of the album to John Coltrane, and soon afterwards, Coltrane urged Impulse! Records to sign Ayler. In June 1965, Coltrane recorded the album "Ascension"; following the recording session, Coltrane "called Ayler and told him, 'I recorded an album and found that I was playing just like you.' Albert's reply: 'No man, don't you see, you were playing like yourself. You were just feeling what I feel and were just crying out for spiritual unity."
Stollman was energized by the experience, and recalled: "I was thrilled with that record, so I was very much charged up with the idea of going forward. I wanted to explore this new music." A week following the "Spiritual Unity" session, Ayler, Peacock, and Murray, along with Don Cherry, John Tchicai, and Roswell Rudd, recorded "New York Eye and Ear Control", which would also be released by ESP-Disk. The label would issue several additional Ayler albums, including "Bells" and "Spirits Rejoice". According to Stollman, following Ayler's death in 1970, he represented the musician's estate.
Critical reception.
Initial critical reaction to "Spiritual Unity" was mixed. Scott Deveaux and Gary Giddins observed that the album "was both cheered and ridiculed", and stated that "Ayler's huge sound evoked lusty hysteria". In July 1965, DownBeat published an article which featured a negative, zero-star review by Kenny Dorham, who wrote that the album is "not worth the paper it takes to review it. Too far out. He passed the moon and the stars", alongside a positive review by Bill Mathieu, who wrote: "Notes disappear into wide, irregular ribbons, fragmented, prismatic, wind-blown, undetermined, and filled with fury. Though the fury is frightening, dangerous, it achieves absolute certainty through being, musically, absolutely contained... Ayler seemingly rarely hears one note at a time—as if it were useless ever to consider the particles of a thing. He seems to want to scan all notes at all times and in this way speak to an expanded consciousness. And the consistency in this outpouring is a reference point from which his music takes shape... Ayler's music, as well as most avant-garde music, is, at best, difficult to listen to. It is nevertheless a very direct statement, the physical manifestation of a spiritual or mystical ritual. Its logic is the logic of human flesh in the sphere of the spirit. Could it be that ritual is more accessible to some listeners than it is to others?"
Recent reaction has been more positive. The authors of "The Penguin Guide to Jazz" selected the album as part of their suggested "Core Collection," awarding it a "crown" in addition to a four-star rating, and commenting: "the 1964 Ayler trio was quintessentially a listening band, locked in a personal struggle which it is possible only to observe, awestruck, from the sidelines." In 2013, "Spin" included it on the "Top 100 Alternative Albums of the 1960s" list. In 2017, "Pitchfork" placed it at number 30 on the "200 Best Albums of the 1960s" list.
Val Wilmer wrote that "Spiritual Unity" "revolutionised the direction for anyone playing those three instruments. The music was shockingly different - Ayler disquietingly harsh and brutal but at the same time deeply tinged with pathos, Peacock listening as he played monumental bass figures, Murray behaving, as LeRoi Jones once put it, as though 'he might just want to disappear' - but its conclusions seemed so simple when you listened to it. Ayler, Murray and Peacock had created the perfect "group" music." According to John Corbett, "Spiritual Unity" represents "one of the most radical moments" in an "alternative way of thinking" where instrumentalists ask: "What is my supposed role, and what if I don't want to live by it?" He wrote: "The saxophone and bass and drums are doing something quite different from what they normally do—the bassist... is melodic, skittish, and virtuosic; the drummer... gathers pools and eddies of sound, mounting and dissipating volume, his cymbals awash in nervous energy; the saxophonist... only plays a smidge of melodic material, concentrating on ecstatic shouts and cries, swooping across the others in big slurs and swipes, lightning flashing across a turbulent sea. The conventional roles of the instruments are upended, reinvented." Corbett went on to compare the experience to "driving an automobile in which the relationships between the parts of the motor are repeatedly reinvented."
Ted Gioia called "Spiritual Unity" "a major statement, the most cohesive ensemble project the saxophonist had undertaken to date", in which "Ayler showed that his radical remaking of the jazz saxophone vocabulary was largely self-sufficient, needing no other horns to set it off or support its blistering attack. It encompassed fervent explorations of harmonics, haunting stringlike evocations in the higher register, and Vesuvian explosions of sonic lava. Peacock and Murray hold onto these energized lines with the determination of cowpokes latching onto steers at the rodeo. To their credit, they grapple masterfully with Ayler's unpredictable leaps and turns." The authors of "The Penguin Jazz Guide" described Ayler's trio as "quintessentially a listening band, locked in a personal struggle which it is possible only to observe, awestruck, from the side-lines", and, having noted that Ayler had recorded traditional material on "Swing Low Sweet Spiritual" earlier that year, wrote: "Heard in that context, it is impossible to consider "Spiritual Unity" as anything other than an extension of vernacular themes, played in an ecstatic manner typical of the African-American churches. Brief as it is, it remains a record of immitigable power and authority, but there is humour under the surface and a humanity that is rarely acknowledged."
Saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings, leader of the band Sons of Kemet, wrote that the first time he listened to "Spiritual Unity", he "didn't understand anything!... My brain couldn't compute it." He commented: "this was untranscribable – it seemed like there was nothing to steal from it. It sounded like he was crying through the saxophone. You can hear vocalisation in Sidney Bechet and the older guys, but this was the first time I'd heard someone follow through on that and not try to mesh it with something more conventional". Eventually, he stated, "The more I listened, the more I realised that it's in what Anthony Braxton calls 'an emotional zone' – whatever Ayler does, it's about the emotional intent behind it. I wanted to see whether I could get into that space where you're free to do that. It's all about the big picture – more like painting."
Mark Richardson wrote that Ayler had a "telepathic empathy" with Peacock and Murray on "Spiritual Unity", and stated: "Together Peacock and Murray form a sound backing that at times seems more like an endlessly shifting cluster of sound than an actual rhythm section. Murray has a light, rapid touch, keeping the cymbals and snares going pretty much constantly, never breaking the flow of the music with a heavy roll, and Peacock functions as an extension of his textures." He concluded by calling the album "short... intense, and a deserved classic." John Fordham, writing in "The Guardian", commented: "Half a century since the trio unleashed this music in a tiny Times Square studio, it still blazes, uplifts and unnerves. Ayler emerges from a Sonny Rollins-like jauntiness into slurred-pitch flurries and klaxon hoots over Peacock's prodding lines and Murray's shadings on the opening 'Ghosts'; barges ferociously through seamless runs on 'The Wizard'; and calls imploringly in a tone somewhere between an impassioned singer and a microtonal viola player on the meditative 'Spirits'. It still sounds like music on the edge".
In a review for All About Jazz, Mark Corroto called the album "30 minutes that changed the direction of jazz", and wrote: "Fifty years after the recording of Albert Ayler's "Spiritual Unity", the music (and the man) are still causing tumult. It is not so much that free jazz hasn't been on our radar these past decades, it's just that this recording remains one of those 'where were you, when you first heard it?' experiences." He continued: "Bassist Gary Peacock... doesn't so much keep time as feed the fires of Ayler's free folk jazz playing. Peacock bridged from his work with pianists Bill Evans and Paul Bley into this open expression with Ayler. Hearing him bow lines on 'Spirits' or pull energy bombs on 'Ghosts' is akin to watching a boxer working out on a speed bag. The same holds true for drummer Sunny Murray who eschews the presumptions of pulse for accent. His cymbal work sizzles throughout... Ayler's marches, his folk-jazz and New Orleans brass sound was (is) an audacious and indomitable approach to music making that was both revolutionary and an 'ah-ha' moment in the development of free jazz of the 1960s that still resonates loudly today".
Ayler biographer Jeff Schwartz stated: "The music recorded at this session is simply incredible... All three members are constantly improvising freely. It is only convention that makes one hear a saxophone accompanied by bass and drums. In fact, while there is quite a bit of brilliant interaction between the players, it is much more helpful to view the pieces recorded by the Ayler trio as sets of simultaneous solos. Never before (or maybe since) had an ensemble taken the New Orleans ideal of collective improvisation to such an extreme level." Regarding Ayler's tone, Schwartz wrote: "No jazz player had ever used a vibrato as wide as Ayler's and it is primarily the melodrama of this sound that led critics to describe him as primitive. In this crying, braying oscillation of pitch is perhaps Ayler's greatest break with jazz tradition. It is as if he is refusing to be 'hip,' to hide his feelings, to be 'cool,' like the vibratoless Paul Desmond and Lee Konitz. He has gone beyond the vocalized vibrato of players like Louis Armstrong to what can only be described as sobbing." Writer Ekkehard Jost noted that "Ayler's negation of fixed pitches finds a counterpart in Peacock's and Murray's negation of the beat. In no group of this time is so little heard of a steady beat... The absolute rhythmic freedom frequently leads to action on three independent rhythmic planes: Ayler improvises in long drawn-out sound-spans; Peacock hints at chains of impulses, irregular and yet swinging in a remote sense; Murray plays on cymbals with a very live resonance, creating colour rather than accentuation."
Music critic S. Victor Aaron wrote: "Jazz began as Buddy Bolden's ragtime inspired by former slaves performing in New Orleans' Congo Square during the latter years of the nineteenth century. Somehow it ended up some seventy years later in a studio just off of New York's Times Square. That's when and where Albert Ayler and his trio recorded "Spiritual Unity" on one summer day in 1964... it was apparent that the maverick saxophonist Albert Ayler walked into that studio fifty years ago last week to bring jazz to the terminus point in its trajectory of development." He continued: "this record was well ahead of the frontier of jazz. And still today, there's not much out there that is truly 'out there' as "Spiritual Unity". There are scant few among those that possess its uncanny focus and unified purpose... To go way forward in music, you have to go back fifty years."
In a review, writer Jackson Brown stated: "Albert Ayler's "Spiritual Unity" is a confluence of divergent paths stretching back as far as our species can trace, as far as man's first experiments with giving force a form in the manner of sound... It is not the mere representation of the thing that Ayler achieves here, but the recontextualization, the liberation of the American musical tradition. The result is otherworldly... Ayler desired to dispense with the constraints of musical notes and conventional composition. In its place, he sought the sound in between notes and the expression of his instrument as a primal force, an extension of himself in which to explore a unique timbre, improvising in both high and low registers with squeaks, honks, blasts: bursts of passion them all". Regarding the trio, he wrote: "the amount of understanding this group has for each other's tendencies and creative pursuits is staggering, nigh telepathic... the entire album is three separate 'solos,' each one building off of the other. The group feels less like three different musicians and more like a unified, spiritual organism in communion with itself". He concluded: "Albert Ayler drew on the disparate musics of the American tradition and boldly forged his own path through the flames, inspiring some of the most inspirational figures in jazz and shaping the future of avant-garde music to come. He will not be forgotten, or forgiven, for that".

Governor of Anjouan

The Governor of Anjouan is the head of Anjouan, one of the three islands of the Union of Comoros. The position was firstly established as the President of Anjouan in 1997 after the Declaration of independence of Anjouan. Secondly the position became President of the autonomous island of Anjouan following the adoption of the Union of Comoros Constitution of 2001.
The first President of Anjouan was Foundi Ibrahim Abdallah from 1997 to 1999.
Saïd Abeid Abdérémane succeeded to Foundi Ibrahim Abdallah in 1999 and was President of Anjouan until August 2001, date of the military putsch by Mohamed Bacar.
Mohamed Bacar held the elected position from 14 April 2002 to 26 April 2007, when the country's Federal Constitutional Court declared his remaining in office after his term ended on 14 April illegal. Two days later, Comorian president Ahmed Abdallah Sambi appointed Kaambi Houmadi as interim President of Anjouan. Houmadi was replaced by Dhoihirou Halidi on 11 May 2007. This solution was rejected by Bacar, who held his own illegal elections in June which, unsurprisingly, he won in a landslide result of massive fraud. In February 2008 the Government of the Union of Comoros declared it had failed to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis and organised an armed intervention on 25 March 2008 which quickly seized back control of the island. Ikililou Dhoinine, one of the federation's vice presidents, was appointed as interim leader of Anjouan on 26 March 2008. On 30 March, Lailizamane Abdou Cheik, who was head of Anjouan's Court of Appeal (and was therefore the constitutional successor to the Presidency in the event of a vacancy), was appointed as Interim President; he was sworn in on 31 March.
Following the presidential elections held in June 2008, Moussa Toybou was sworn in as president on 5 July 2008.
The takeover of Anjouan by the Government of the Union of Comoros has indeed transformed the statute of President of Anjouan into the statute of Governor with limited privileges.

Acolman

Acolman de Nezahualcóyotl is a town and municipality located in the northern part of State of Mexico, part of the Greater Mexico City area, just north of the city proper. According to myth, the first man was placed here after being taken out of Lake Texcoco. In the community of Tepexpan, the fossilized bones more than 12,000 years old of a man were found in the 20th century. The settlement was founded in the eighth century and was an important commerce center at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire.
After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Acolman became the site of an important Augustinian monastery in the 16th century that still contains important art and architecture from that time period.
History.
According to an ancient myth, when the gods created the first man, they took him from the waters of Lake Texcoco and placed him alone in Acolman. The arm of this man, ringed by drops of water from the lake is the Aztec glyph for the site. The glyph can also be seen on the monastery which dominates the landscape here. Acolman is derived from a Nahuatl phrase which has been interpreted in various ways. It may mean "man with hand or arm" or "where man is made." Acolman is the modern name but the settlement has been referred to as Oculma, Axuruman and Aculma in colonial era documents.
The municipality is home of the Tepexpan man, named after the community in which he was found. The Tepexpan man is a Subboreal Holocene human fossilized skeleton that was found in the mid-20th century.
The founding of the settlement of Acolman is attributed to the Acolhuas, a Chichimeca people, around the eighth century. The settlement started out independent but was first conquered by the Huexotzincas and remained subject to one dominion or another since. By the time of the tlatoani Nezahualcoyotl, Acolman was an important town in the Tetzcoco altepetl after it was conquered by the Aztecs in 1396. The town was important because it was the only place in Mesoamerica that specialized in the breeding and raising of dogs (today known as the breed called xoloitzcuintli).
At the time of the Spanish conquest, Acolman was governed by Moctezuma II. After, Acolman became the encomienda of Pedro de Solis de los Monteros and his son Francisco. The Franciscans arrived first, but the Augustinians were in charge of evangelization efforts after 1539, with twenty-four friars in residence by 1580. This order built one of the most important early colonial era monasteries in New Spain here.
The 17th and 18th century was marked by severe floodings issues, which caused widespread damage and population shifts. These floods eventually caused the disappearance of towns near Acolman such as Tlacuilocan, Tzapotla, and Tescazonco. During one of the attempts to control the rivers in the area, a dam was constructed which cause havoc for the area. During one of the floods, the monastery was submerged in over six feet of water, covering the church floor with silt and nearly destroying the cloisters. In the 17th and 18th centuries, epidemics such as smallpox decimated the native population.
After the Mexican War of Independence, Acolman became the seat of the municipality of the same name. In 1876, due to political instability, the seat was temporarily moved to a town called Xometla. In 1877, it returned to Acolman and the appendage "de Nezahualcoyotl" as added.
Another flood affected the municipality in 1925 and affected the monastery, but also spurred the beginning of restoration efforts that would last until the end of the 20th century. The monastery was declared a national monument in 1933.
The torch of the 1968 Summer Olympics passed through here on its way to Mexico City.
The town and its monastery.
The town.
The most important feature of the town by far is the former monastery of San Agustin, located next to the main plaza. However, there are some other attractions as well. The Central Library and Casa de la Cultura contain paintings and sculptures by a native of Acolman named Parmeno. At the municipal market, foods such as mixiote, barbacoa, consume and turkey in mole can be found as well as pulque.
Main festivals include the Feast of Saint Nicholas on 10 September, of the Archangel Michael on 29 September and the Virgin of Guadalupe on 12 December. These are celebrated with traditional dances such as Concheros, Arrieros, Contradance, Pastores, Inditos and Teomates as well as fireworks, amusement rides and music.
The most distinguishing festival for the town is the Feria de la Posada y la Piñata (Piñata and Las Posadas Fair), which has been held here every December since 1985. Acolman claims to be the origin of the Las Posadas tradition in Mexico as well as the "cradle" of piñatas, as they have been a tradition here for over 420 years. Both kinds of piñatas, those made with clay pots and those made entirely of paper are created here. Participants gather from various communities in the area and the main event is a piñata contest. There are also horse races, bullfighting, nativity scenes, "pastorelas" a type of play based on the Christmas season, regional dance, and popular music shows. Horse racing is a tradition that dates back to the Mexican Revolution.
The monastery.
Declared a national monument in 1933, the Monastery of San Agustín was built between 1539 and 1580 with most of the work being done after 1550. The walls are of rubble-stone construction and covered in plaster, topped by battlements, and the overall appearance is that of fortress. The crown of battlements, the single bell tower, the open chapel and the Plateresque facade identify the complex as a classic 16th century religious construction. The fortress appearance of complexes of this time were not literally for protection but rather served to dominate the landscape much as mediaeval castles in Europe did. In areas where there are carefully fitted stones, these stones have been carved. The construction of the monastery is attributed to Andrés de Olmos. Restoration work has been done in this complex since the 1920s, which has revealed all of the church’s facade and the atrium is terraced down to its original level of construction. This has exposed the flood damage from the colonial period. Most of the murals and frescos had been buried under years of plaster and paints before being restored.
The complex is fronted by a large square atrium, and a courtyard before that, the two of which are today separated by a road The most important feature of this atrium area is the high stone cross, which is considered to be an important expression of "tequitqui" or Christian art executed by Indian craftsmen from the very early colonial period. The cross was mostly likely erected between the time that the Franciscans occupied the site and before the architectural sculptures of the current complex. The cross is decorated with plants, flowers and flames at the top (which allude to the Passion of Christ) all sculpted into the stone. There is also a melancholy, mask-like face of Christ, with crown of thorns which projects from the center of the cross. At the foot of the stone cross is a Madonna figures who has been identified as the Virgin of Sorrows and even associated with the goddess Coatlicue. At the feet of this Virgin is a weathered stone skull and a serpent, and in her breast is imbedded a dark stone disk. This follows the Aztec tradition of placing jades or other precious stones in their statues to symbolize the soul.
To the back of the atrium area is the main church, with its rose/tan Plateresque facade reminiscent of the Colegiata de Santa María in Calatayud, Spain. The facade has Classical composite columns with Plateresque sections below the ribbon garniture, Saint Paul under a deep, Gothic-like canopy with a Renaissance angel below. The portal has double Renaissance doors under archivolts decorated with fruit. Above the doors are seahorses on the main frieze and Moorish paneling on the doors themselves. This facade was mostly likely created by Spanish craftsmen and had significant influence on other Augustinian church fronts in New Spain, especial at Yuriria and Cuitzeo in Michaocán and at Metztitlán in Hidalgo. The church building is long, wide and high, with the interior walls particularly high The interior vault was modified and the interior pilasters and exterior buttresses were added in 1735. The main altarpiece dates from 1690 and was put here in the 20th century to replace the original. The side altarpieces date from the 18th century. These Baroque altarpieces are all sculpted in wood and gilded, decorated with plants, flower, celestial figures and angels. The presbytery has a late medieval ribbed vault and important frescos in black, white and orange, with images of saints on thrones, priests and Augustine popes.
The small open chapel, or chapel of the Indians is located on the upper part of the wall between the church and the main portal to the cloister area. This chapel contains two murals from the 16th century by unknown authors depicting the Last Judgement and Catherine of Alexandria.
The monastery consists of two cloisters. The Claustro Chico or small cloister is of simple architecture, constructed in stone with a cross in the center which has an anagram of Jesus' name. The Claustro Grande or large cloister (also called the Naranjo or Orange Tree cloister) has a more elaborate Plateresque design with "Isabelino" type columns. The small cloister may date from the Franciscan period or might be part of the early Augustinian church. Flatted arches on piers with a barrel-vaulted corridor on the ground level and a wood-roofed second level suggest the simple construction of the very early colonial period. Primitive frescos decorate the walls. The stone cross here is very similar to the Franciscan cross at one of the earliest monasteries in Cuernavaca. The crucifixion fresco on the second level is inspired by various European sources of the 15th and 16th centuries such as German prints, Italian and German ornamental panels. Starkly done in black and white, it reflects the continuing importance of the graphic arts. It also has sun and moon designs, common during the early colonial period, which reflect both old European astrological symbols as well as the importance of these in native art. In the larger, more ornate, cloister, there are medallions with images such as the coat of arms of the Augustine order, a symbol for death, and a symbol representing the union of two worlds. The lower floor has a series of stone etchings with scenes related to the Passion of Christ.
Museo Virrenal.
Much of the cloister area is occupied by the "Museo Virrenal" (Colonial Era) founded in 1925 in what were the portico, the kitchen the refectory and the hallway to the refectory. It has three main halls which give a detailed explanation of the construction of the site, the lives of the monks and the collection of paintings and religious objects that are on display. The museum contains more than 120 pieces. Many of the religious artwork and objects are in the third hall and include furniture, cloaks, and other religious garb (some embroidered in gold thread), sculptures in stone, wood and corn stalk paste, and oils from the 16th to the 19th centuries.
A website has been created by INAH to allow for the virtual visitation of the museum. The tour is a series of 360 degree panoramic views of each of the rooms and the pre-Hispanic base over which the monastery was built. Some of the restored rooms that are visible this way include the kitchen and the dispensary. The church is also accessible in this manner.(virtual) The site is at http://www.inah.gob.mx y http://culturainah.org/panorama360/acolman/
The municipality.
As municipal seat, the town of Acolman is the governing authority for over sixty other named communities,(inegi) which cover a total area of 86.88 km2. At the 2010 census, the total population of the municipality was 136,558, but only about four percent of this population lives in the town proper.(inegi) The municipality borders the municipalities of Tecámac, San Juan Teotihuacán, San Salvador Atenco, Tezoyuca, Chiautla, Tepetlaoxtoc and Ecatepec.
Towns and villages.
The municipal seat, Acolman de Nezahualcóyotl, has a population of 5,571 inhabitants, while the largest city (locality) in the municipality, Tepexpan, has a population of 102,667, more than 18 times as big. This is the largest relative difference between any municipal seat and its largest locality of any municipality in Mexico. The largest localities (cities, towns, and villages) are:
The municipality is located on a plain in the northern portion of the Valley of Mexico called the Valley of Teotihuacan. It has only three significant elevations. The eastern border is marked by the Sierra de Patlachique and the west is marked by a mountain called Chiconautla. Chiconautla and Tlahuilco are forested and are protected areas. From the mountains that surround this plain flow a number of streams such as the San José and the San Antonio, which are commonly called the Rio Grande and the Rio Chico. The municipality lacks fresh water springs, with most potable water coming from deep wells. The climate is temperate and semi-arid with rains in the summer. Temperatures can range from 36 °C in the summer to -4 °C in the winter. Forested areas of the municipality contain trees such as ahuehuete, mesquite, eucalyptus and Peruvian pepper. In the lower, flatter regions, the flora consists of shrubs, grasses, cactus and other plants adapted to dry areas. Wildlife consists mostly of small mammals such as rabbits and skunks, small reptiles such as the chameleon and insects.
The municipality is connected by the, "Lechería-Texcoco highway", which starts at the confluence of the "Peñón-Texcoco" and "Los Reyes-Texcoco" motorways. The town is also connected to localities such as Teotihuacán and, more distantly, Pachuca (Hidalgo).
Economy.
Most of the municipality’s territory is dedicated to agriculture. Major crops include barley, corn, sorghum, wheat, maguey, and various vegetables. Orchards also exist there producing capulins, peaches, pears, figs, plums, white sapote, tejocotes and apricots. Livestock includes cattle, pigs, goats and domestic fowl. The second most important economic activity is industry, producing processed foods, drinks, tobacco products and leather goods. Mining is limited to gravel, sand and other construction materials. There are small deposits of gold, silver, copper, quartz and mercury, but they have not been exploited. Most mines are located near the communities of San Pedro Tepetitlan and Xometla. Commerce is mostly limited to serving local needs.
The municipality has a narrow economic base, based on manufacturing and agriculture, with much of the farmland still in ejido status. Acolman is a bedroom community with many of its workers commuting to places such as Mexico City proper and other cities in the State of Mexico. Of those working in the municipality, less than ten percent of the population is employed in agriculture with the rest evenly split between industry and commerce. Population growth has been significantly slower than in other parts of the Mexico City area.
In 2008, Moody's assigned a classification of A3.mx (Mexico scale) and Ba3 (global scale) to the municipality of Acolman. The reasons behind the grades are that while the municipality has a moderate amount of debt and adequate financial development, there have been some management issues in recent years. It also reflects the limited economic base of the area and the need for infrastructure. The municipality needs between 12.5 and 25 million pesos worth of roadwork, which it cannot finance and needs help from the State of Mexico. Unlike other municipalities in the Greater Mexico City area, water supply is based on a system of nineteen water suppliers, with only three owned by the municipality.
Tourism.
The main tourist attractions are the archaeological zone of Tepexpan, where the fossilized bones of the Tepexpan man were found, and the former monastery of San Agustin de Acolman. The Tepexpan Museum is located in the community of the same name, famous due to the discovery of the "Tepexpan Man", a human skeleton which is more than 12,000 years old. It was found in 1945 by Dr. Helmut de Terra and Alberto R. Arellano. The museum exhibits mammoth remains as well as flint and obsidian tools. Other attractions in the municipality include the former haciendas of San Antonio, Tepexpan and Nextlalpan. The San Antonio Hacienda is one of the few colonial-era haciendas what has managed to preserve its original architecture. Today it operates as a recreational center. The Castillo Dam was constructed in the 18th century. Other attractions include the "Cueva de los Gatos" cave, and the Cuevas de la Amistad (Friendship Caves) has areas dedicated to medicinal herbs in addition to the caves. The Sierra de Patlachique is an eco-tourism park with facilities for picnicking, swimming, football, cycling and camping.
One important community outside the seat is called Cuanalán, which is a Nahua community. Fewer than 500 people can still speak an indigenous language, but a number of traditions survive. The community of Cuanalán is noted for its musicians, especially those dedicated to wind instruments. The better known groups include Los Vasquez, Los Juárez and Los Chicanos.

Donald Kimball

Donald Wren Kimball (December 10, 1943 — September 15, 2006) was a Roman Catholic priest with a radio ministry directed toward youth, until he was removed from the priesthood over allegations of sexual abuse.
Early life.
Kimball was born in Santa Rosa, California. His father was killed during World War II.
Kimball graduated from St. Vincent de Paul High School in Petaluma, California, and attended St. Joseph's Seminary in Mountain View, California.
In the 1970s he developed a religious radio program that targeted young people. The award-winning show blended top 40 pop music with Bible teachings.
Scandal.
Kimball was accused of using his charm and popularity to coerce teenage girls into having sex with him. In 1990 he acknowledged having sexual contact with six young girls and church officials forced him to give up his youth ministry. He was also suspended from performing priestly duties.
Pope John Paul II formally removed Kimball from the priesthood in 2000, the same year criminal sex abuse charges were filed against Kimball.
In 2002, Kimball was acquitted of raping a 14-year-old girl in 1977, but convicted of molesting a 13-year-old girl in 1981. The conviction was overturned in 2003 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a California law extending the statute of limitations for sex crimes involving children.
In February 2003, Kimball was convicted on charges of felony assault and vandalism stemming from the 2002 trial. He had shoved the camera of a "San Francisco Chronicle" reporter into her face and then threw the camera onto the floor. In June, he was sentenced to three years in prison. However, Kimball was released from prison in September 2003 after the judge reduced his sentence to time served, plus probation, 200 hours of community service, and $11,735 in fines.
Death.
Kimball's body was discovered in the home of a friend in Windsor, California. The Sonoma County Sheriff's Department said there were no signs of criminal activity. An autopsy confirmed that the death was by natural causes, a heart attack.

10.5 cm Flak 38

The 10.5 cm Flak 38 was a German anti-aircraft gun used during World War II by the Luftwaffe. An improved version was introduced as the 10.5 cm Flak 39.
Development.
Land version.
The Flak 38 was introduced as a competitor to the 8.8 cm Flak 18. In this role it proved to be too heavy for field use while having roughly similar performance as the 88 mm, therefore it was used primarily in static mounts.
The Flak 39 was an improved version, which replaced the electrical gun laying system with a mechanical one.
Naval version.
The 10.5 cm SK C/33 was used by the Kriegsmarine, the German Navy. Related to the Flak 38, it was installed on the and classes of battleships as well as the - and cruisers. After the war, it was used for a few years by the French "Marine Nationale" on the reconstructed ex-Italian light cruisers, and . In the late 1940s, the French also planned to equip the battleship "Richelieu" with twelve of these mountings, but the project was cancelled due to credit shortage.
They were mounted in pairs on an electrically powered tri-axial mounting, intended to compensate for the motion of the ship and maintain a lock onto the intended target. The mounting was not properly waterproofed and as the mountings were open to the weather and sea swell, this resulted in a high maintenance burden.

The Lapinporokoira is a medium-sized dog, with medium length fur in a double coat. Ears are pricked (standing up; drop ears are a disqualifying fault.) Colour is generally black or dark grey or brown, and occasionally red brown, with a lighter shade on the head and lower parts of the body, often with white markings. Medium in build, height should be 51 cm (20 in) at the withers for males, 46 cm (18 in) for females. Males and females should look distinctly different. Weight is between , males usually heavier than females.
Temperament.
The breed standard states that the dog should be calm, friendly, and docile, but also energetic. Most herding breeds need to be given regular exercise. The temperament of individual dogs may vary.
Activities.
The Lapponian Herder can participate in dog agility trials, carting, mushing, obedience, Rally obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Lapponian Herders exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.
History.
The Sami people of northern Europe used Spitz type herding dogs in managing their herds of reindeer for a very long time. Such dogs were not of modern breeds of documented heritage, and did not have a fixed appearance, but rather were a landrace type of herding dog. Although Swedish and Finnish dog fanciers began collecting information about the type in the 1930s, most of the dogs were lost as a result of World War II.
After the war, various breeders in Sweden and Finland began to try to recreate the lost reindeer herding dogs in their various forms. In Finland, the first was recognised as the Kukonharjulainen (a kennel name) by the Finnish Kennel Club. The breed was a few of the herding dogs crossed with black and white Karelian Bear Dogs, resulting in a short-coated dog. Other breeders with another kennel club in Finland created another breed, this one with a more heavy coat, called the Lapponian Herder. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, more dogs were collected, and assigned to one of the two varieties based on their appearance. Around the same time, the two kennel clubs merged, and all the Finnish reindeer dogs were placed in the same registry. In 1966, they were separated again, based on coat length. One breed was renamed Lapphund at that time, and the other was named Lapinporokoira (translated into English as the Lapponian Herder.)
The Lapinporokoira is recognised under Finnish sponsorship as Fédération Cynologique Internationale in Group 5 "Spitz and primitive types" Section 3 "Nordic Watchdogs and Herders". The stud book for the breed remains open. Exported to North America, it is recognised there by the United Kennel Club in the Herding group (the United Kennel Club places the Finnish Lapphund in the Northern Breed Group.) It is also recognised by various minor kennel clubs and internet based dog registry businesses, and promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.
Lineage.
The breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia. It is the result of a female wolf / male dog hybridization that occurred post-domestication. Subclade d1 originated at most 480–3,000 years ago and includes all Sami-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Jamthund, Norwegian Elkhound and Hällefors Elkhound. The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to these breeds has not been matched across Eurasia

Gasum

Gasum Oy is a Finnish state-owned energy company operating in the Nordics. Gasum owns 18 biogas refineries in Finland, Sweden and Denmark, and is the largest processor of biodegradable waste in the Nordic countries. In addition, Gasum sells wind power and provides various energy market services. It is in the process of building a gas filling station network that will also serve heavy-duty vehicles.
History.
The first natural gas pipeline from the Soviet Union to Finland was opened in 1974. From 1974 to 1994, Neste Oy was responsible for the import, transmission services, and wholesale of natural gas in Finland. Gasum was established in 1994 as a joint venture between Neste (75%) and Gazprom (25%).
After the merger of Neste and Imatran Voima in 1998, the newly created company Fortum had to reduce its stake in Gasum to 25%. As a result, the government of Finland (24%), E.ON (20%) and Finnish forest companies (6%) became new shareholders. In 2004, Fortum acquired the 6% stake from the forest companies. In 2015, Fortum and E.ON sold their stake to the Finnish government. In 2016, Gazprom sold its stake to the Finnish government which became the sole shareholder of the company.
In 2014, Gasum acquired 51% of Skangas from Lyse Energi and increased its ownership to 100% in 2018. Skangas started their LNG business in 2011. In 2018, Gasum built Finland's first liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at the oil and chemical harbor of the port of Tahkoluoto in Pori.
Gasum expanded into the Swedish market in 2016 by acquiring Swedish Biogas International. After the deal, Gasum became the largest biogas producer in the Nordic countries. In April 2020, Gasum acquired Linde AG's LNG and biogas business in Sweden and Norway and Nauticor's marine bunkering business in Germany. The LNG terminals in Nynäshamn in Sweden and the bunkering vessels "Seagas" and "Kairos", were transferred to Gasum.
Gasum planned to build a subsea gas pipeline Balticconnector to connect Finland with the Estonian gas system and further with a gas storage in Latvia. In October 2015, Gasum abandoned the project due to commercial viability. It was replaced in the project by the Finnish state-owned company Baltic Connector Oy.
Before 2020, Gasum owned of gas transmission network in Finland. According to the Natural Gas Market Act of Finland, gas transmission operations were unbundled to another state-owned company Gasgrid Finland Oy, as of 1 January 2020. Starting from 1 January 2020, its subsidiary, Kaasupörssi Oy, which operated Finland's gas exchange, was closed and all trading moved to the regional GET Baltic exchange.
In 2020, the company entered into partnership with Pavilion Energy, Singapore.

9 (Damien Rice album)

9 is the second studio album by an Irish singer, songwriter and producer Damien Rice, released in 2006. The album was released on 3 November in Ireland, 6 November in the United Kingdom and 14 November in the US. It was followed by the single "9 Crimes", which was released on 27 November 2006. The record was certified gold in the UK.
Background.
Damien Rice had originally intended to record only one album, "O", but he ended up releasing "9" at the insistence of his record company. He later said in an interview: "Now I regret that, because I would take half the songs that are on "9" off. I just don't think it's as good a record as it could be".
"Elephant" was originally titled "The Blower's Daughter Part 2". "The Blower's Daughter" is a song on Rice's first album "O".
Critical reaction.
The album was released to mixed critical and fan reaction. "NME" gave the album 4/10, describing it as "IKEA rock". "Hot Press" wrote "If Rice really was a nervous wounded-wing, there's no way he'd skirt as close to Nick Drake comparisons as he does on 'The Animals Are Gone'", and, in a reference to the 'noise' preceding the first track, "there's another noise that can be made out faintly but distinctly – the sound of the Grays, LaMontagnes, Johnsons and the Blunts of this world breaking their pencil tips on their jotters in sheer envy and frustration."
Both "Mojo" and "Q" gave the album 4/5. "The Sunday Times" made it their 'Album of the Week'. It was "People"'s Critic Choice in November 2006.
Sales chart performance.
The album reached number 4 in the UK Albums Chart. In the US, it was on the "Billboard" 200 for 10 weeks, peaking on its debut at number 22.

He later left in 1991, returning to France to play for Orléans Rodez before re-signing for Derry in 1993 where he stayed for a further three seasons. During his two spells at Derry he won one League of Ireland title, two FAI Cups and four League Cups in what proved to be the "Candystripes"' most successful era. Whilst playing for Derry, Vaudequin was referred to as ""Paddy Quinn" or "Paddy Vandequin"" by supporters, who found difficulty in pronouncing his name.
Vaudequin left Derry City in 1997 and signed with the relatively successful Shelbourne. During his short spell with the Dublin side, he won an FAI Cup winners medal in 1997. Pascal then signed for Finn Harps getting to another FAI Cup final in 1999. He then moved to Bohemians, making his debut against Sligo Rovers in January 2000. However, this move was short-lived and Vaudequin promptly signed for Shamrock Rovers spending the 2000–01 and the 2001/02 seasons with them.

Battersea North (UK Parliament constituency)

Battersea North was a parliamentary constituency in the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea, and then the London Borough of Wandsworth, in South London. It returned one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, elected by the first-past-the-post voting system.
It was created for the 1918 general election, when the former Battersea constituency was divided in two. It was abolished for the 1983 general election, when it was reunited with most of Battersea South to form the new Battersea constituency.
Boundaries.
The constituency was created by the Representation of the People Act 1918. When seats were redistributed by the Representation of the People Act 1948 the seat was redefined as consisting of five wards by the addition of the Winstanley ward, transferred from Battersea South. However the wards of the borough were redrawn in 1949 prior to the next general election in 1950. Accordingly, changes were made under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949. Of the 16 new wards, eight were included in each of the Battersea North and South constituencies.
In 1965 Battersea became part of the London Borough of Wandsworth. This, however made no immediate change to the parliamentary constituencies. It was not until the general election of February 1974 that the constituency boundaries were altered. St John's and Shaftesbury wards were transferred from Battersea South. These boundaries were used until abolition.
The constituency was abolished for the election of 1983, and was subsumed by the new Battersea seat, where it formed 61.5% of the total constituency (with the addition of Balham, Fairfield and Northcote wards from Battersea South).

Pantomath

A pantomath is a person who wants to know or knows everything. The word itself is not to be found in common online English dictionaries, the "OED", dictionaries of obscure words, or dictionaries of neologisms.
Etymology.
A pantomath ("pantomathēs", παντομαθής, meaning "having learnt all", from the Greek roots παντ- "all", "every" and the root μαθ-, meaning "learning", "understanding") is a person whose astonishingly wide interests and knowledge span the entire range of the arts and sciences.
Uses.
Pantomath is typically used to convey the sense that a great individual has achieved a pinnacle of learning, that an "automath" has taken autodidacticism to an endpoint. As an example, the obscure and rare term seems to have been applied to those with an astonishingly wide knowledge and interests by these two authors from different eras: Jonathan Miller has been called a pantomath, as has Rupert Hart-Davis.

Threefold Training

The Buddha identified the threefold training (; ; or simply "śikṣā" or "sikkhā") as training in:
In the Pali Canon.
According to Theravada canonical texts, pursuing this training leads to the abandonment of lust, hatred, and delusion. One who is fully accomplished in this training attains nirvana.
In the Anguttara Nikaya, training in "higher virtue" includes following the Patimokkha, training in "higher mind" (sometimes simply referred to as "concentration") includes entering and dwelling in the four jhanas, and training in "higher wisdom" includes directly perceiving the Four Noble Truths or knowledge of destruction of the taints. 
In several canonical discourses, a more "gradual" instruction ("anupubbikathā") is provided to receptive lay people (see also, gradual training). This latter instruction culminates in the teaching of the Four Noble Truths which in itself concludes with the Noble Eightfold Path, the constituents of which can be mapped to this threefold training (see below).
Similarity to threefold partition of the Noble Eightfold Path.
The Buddha's threefold training is similar to the threefold grouping of the Noble Eightfold Path articulated by Bhikkhuni Dhammadinna in Culavedalla Sutta ("The Shorter Set of Questions-And-Answers Discourse," MN 44): virtue ("sīlakkhandha"), concentration ("samādhikkhandha"), wisdom ("paññākkhandha "). These three-part schemes simplify and organize the Eightfold Path as follows:
Mahayana.
The threefold training is also part of the bodhisattva path of the Mahayana. Nagarjuna refers to it in his Letter to a Friend (Suhrllekha), verse 53:
"One should always train (shiksha) in superior discipline (adhishila), superior wisdom (adhiprajna) and superior mind (adhicitta)"

<doc id="7030522" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7030522" title="Troxel v. Granville">
Troxel v. Granville

Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States struck down a Washington state law that allowed any third party to petition state courts for child visitation rights over parental objections. The Court held that parents have a fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children, and that right is protected by the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Background.
Tommie Granville and Brad Troxel had two daughters from a relationship that ended in 1991. After they broke up, the father lived with his parents and regularly brought his daughters to his parents' home for weekend visits. The father died in May 1993, and in October 1993, Tommie Granville informed the father's parents that she wished to limit visitations to once a month. The paternal grandparents petitioned to obtain visitation rights with their granddaughters.
In 1995, the Washington Superior Court ordered that the grandparents have visitation one weekend per month, one week during the summer, and four hours on both of the petitioning grandparents' birthdays. Granville appealed. Before addressing the merits of the case, the State Court of Appeals remanded for entry of written findings of fact and conclusions of law, citing the best interests of the children as reason for their decision. The Washington Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, dismissed the grandparents' petition, and held that the limitations on non-parental visitation were consistent with "parents' fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their children". The Washington State Supreme Court affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme court granted "certiorari".
Plurality.
The Court plurality opinion, authored by Justice O’Connor, held that "the interest of parents in the care, custody and control of their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court." That fundamental right is implicated in grandparent visitation cases, and as such, it struck down the Washington visitation statute because it unconstitutionally infringed on the right.
The Court noted that parents “act in the best interests of their children”. (quoting Parham v. J.R. (1979)). State courts considering non-parent visitation petitions must apply "a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children." "Troxel" requires that state courts must give "special weight" to a fit parent's decision to deny non-parent visitation, as well as other decisions made by a parent regarding the care and custody of their children.
The plurality held that "choices [parents make] about the upbringing of children... are among associational rights... sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the State's unwarranted usurpation, disregard, or disrespect." This principle must inform the understanding of the "special weight" that "Troxel" requires courts to give to parents' decisions. Even though "Troxel" does not define "special weight," previous Supreme Court precedent indicates that "special weight" is a term signifying very considerable deference.
The "special weight" requirement, as illuminated by these prior Supreme Court cases, means that the deference provided to the parent's wishes will be overcome only by some compelling governmental interest and by overwhelmingly clear factual circumstances supporting that governmental interest. This is essentially identical to the strict scrutiny standard, in keeping with the fundamental status of parental rights.
Concurrences.
Justice Souter questioned the Washington Supreme Court's holding, and the plurality's strong implication, that actual harm must be demonstrated before a parental decision may be questioned by a state authority. He instead argued that the statute was unconstitutional on its face due to overbreadth.
Justice Thomas applied strict scrutiny and reached the conclusion that "the State of Washington lacks even a legitimate governmental interest–to say nothing of a compelling one–in second-guessing a fit parent’s decision regarding visitation with third parties." However, Thomas questioned whether "Meyer v. Nebraska" and "Pierce v. Society of Sisters" were correctly decided, but floated the possibility that parental rights may be protected under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment instead. Because neither party asked the Court to do so, Thomas did not reexamine the holdings of "Meyer" and "Pierce".
Dissent.
Justice Scalia wrote that while the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children is among the "unalienable Rights" with which the Declaration of Independence proclaims "all men ... are endowed by their Creator," and that right is also among the unenumerated "othe[r] [rights] retained by the people" under the Ninth Amendment, parents have no enforceable rights because they are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution.
Justice Stevens' opinion stated that parents have some rights under the Constitution, but that states may infringe upon them to guarantee the child's interest in a relationship with third parties. Stevens stated that parental rights may not be exercised in a way that a state court may deem to be "arbitrary", and that the best interest of the child standard was sufficient.
Justice Kennedy likewise argued that the best interest of the child standard may be applied, but the parent's decision should be given some weight, and stated that the judgment should be vacated and remanded to the Washington courts to determine whether the factual circumstances justified overturning Granville's decision. Kennedy also raised the concern that state family court procedures may be disrupted by the Court's holding.
Legacy.
The decision in "Troxel v. Granville" affected the interpretation of state laws granting grandparent visitation rights. The Troxel Court declined to decide whether the Due Process Clause requires nonparental visitation statutes to include a showing of harm in order to be valid, leaving the question open as to what governmental interests courts should consider in deciding if visitation is appropriate. Many states have upheld nonparental visitation statutes against "Troxel" challenges by distinguishing between statutes applying the "best interests" standard that gave equal weight to parental and nonparental claims and statutes that give extra weight to parental parties.

<doc id="7030523" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7030523" title="Round Table (horse)">
Round Table (horse)

Round Table (April 6, 1954 – June 13, 1987) was an American Thoroughbred Hall of Fame racehorse. He is considered the greatest turf horse in American racing history.
Background.
Round Table was foaled at Claiborne Farm in Kentucky, on the night of April 6, 1954. Bold Ruler was foaled at the same farm, on the same night, and both stallions won American Horse of the Year honors in their respective careers, returning to Claiborne to stand at stud. He was trained by Moody Jolley.
Racing career.
Round Table's most significant win as a two-year-old came in October 1956, when he won the Breeders' Futurity Stakes at Keeneland Race Course. On February 9, 1957, Claiborne Farm owner Arthur B. Hancock Jr. sold Round Table after his second start of the three-year-old season to Oklahoma oilman Travis M. Kerr. The sale agreement included Round Table standing at stud at Claiborne when his racing career was over with Claiborne receiving twenty percent of his breeding income.
Racing at age three, with Kerr having hired William Molter as his trainer, and Jack Williams as assistant trainer, Round Table won the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland in track-record time. He then finished third to Calumet Farm's Iron Liege in the Kentucky Derby, with the heavily favored Bold Ruler finishing 4th. After the Derby, Round Table was shipped back to race in California and started a winning streak of eleven races, including the Hollywood Gold Cup and United Nations Handicap which later became Grade I stakes races. He was the leading money winner of 1957 and won the first of his three straight U.S. Champion Turf Horse titles.
In 1958, Round Table dominated American Thoroughbred racing. He began the year by capturing the races that are now known as the Strub Series at Santa Anita Park, becoming the first horse to win the Malibu Stakes, the San Fernando Stakes, and the Santa Anita Maturity, now the Strub Stakes. He ended the season as the winner of every racing award available to him, including Horse of the Year.
Five years old in 1959, he won 9 of his 14 races and his third Champion Turf Horse title. In the January 24, 1959 San Marcos Handicap race on turf, Round Table carried 132 pounds when he broke the Santa Anita Park course and United States record with a time of 1:58 2/5 for a mile and one-quarter on turf. It marked the fifth time in his career that he had run a mile and one-quarter under two minutes. No other horse in history had run that distance in under the two-minute mark more than twice.
Round Table's lifetime earnings were $1,749,869, and he was the third American Thoroughbred to earn more than a million dollars, after Citation and Nashua. Of his 66 starts, he won 43, placed in 8, and showed in 5, and he set or equaled 14 track records, including one world record and two U.S. records.
Stud record.
Retired at the end of the 1959 racing season to stand at stud at Claiborne Farm, Round Table was the leading sire in North America in 1972. He sired 83 stakes winners including He's A Smoothie, Baldric, Apalachee, Artaius, Cellini, Advocator, Flirting Around, King's Bishop, and Poker, who was the damsire of two Hall of Fame inductees, Seattle Slew and Silver Charm. His daughter Isolt was the dam of Sir Tristram whose progeny earned him 17 official Leading Australasian sire premierships, plus nine broodmare sire titles.
Among his descendants are Horse of the Year winners A.P. Indy and Mineshaft. His worldwide reputation both in racing and as a sire was so great that when Queen Elizabeth II visited Kentucky in 1984, she asked to see the 30-year-old horse. Her father, King George VI, bred Round Table's dam, Knight's Daughter.
Round Table died at the age of 33 on June 13, 1987. He is buried in the equine cemetery at Claiborne Farm.

Highnam

Highnam is a village and civil parish on the outskirts of the city of Gloucester. It is three miles northwest of the city on the A40, on the way to Ross, west of Alney Island and Over Bridge. It is connected by Segregated Bicycle Paths via Over Bridge and Alney Island to Gloucester. The parish includes the villages of Lassington and Over. In the 2001 census the parish had a population of 2,014, reducing to 1,916 at the 2011 census. At the 2021 census it had increased to 2,141.
Highnam was originally made up of farm land, which explains some of its street names (Brimsome Meadow, Poppy Field, Stoney Field, Long Field, Peters Field, Williams Orchard, et al.). As a village, Highnam is fairly small, containing few social amenities. These include the Church of the Holy Innocents, a school (Highnam C of E Primary), a village hall, a day nursery, a village shop and a doctor's surgery.
The Arnold family were Lords of the Manor in the sixteenth century- the best known member of the family is Sir Nicholas Arnold (died 1580), Lord Deputy of Ireland.
The wealthy artist and collector Thomas Gambier Parry purchased the Highnam Court estate in 1837. He remodelled the Court and laid out the Highnam Court gardens; he was one of the first to make a pinetum. Highnam Court gardens are now open to the public. His son, the composer Hubert Parry, learnt to play the organ in the church.
Highnam has an eighteen-hole golf course and a large business park just outside the main village. The village is home to both football and cricket teams Highnam Court Cricket Club and also has Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Brownies groups. A new feature in 2007 was the addition of a Youth Café.
Highnam Woods to the west of the village are managed by the RSPB as a nature reserve, and Lassington Wood is to the east of the village.

The church of the Holy Innocents, Highnam was constructed between 1849 and 1851 at the request of Thomas Gambier Parry in memory of his first wife and those of his children who died at an early age. The church was designed by Henry Woodyer in a Gothic style.
Gambier-Parry adorned the whole of the chancel, including the roof, and much of the nave with frescoes using a new "spirit fresco" method he adapted from his study of Italian fresco painters. The church has been described by Sir John Betjeman as "The most complete Victorian Church in this country". In Simon Jenkins' book "England's Thousand Best Churches", Holy Innocents was rated in the "Top 100" with four stars.
A major restoration of the church and frescoes was completed in 1994. The Grade I listed church forms an ensemble with its listed Church Lodge, Rectory, Memorial Hall and Old Schoolhouse on the edge of the park of Highnam Court.
Although unringable, the tower contains the world's heaviest ring of three bells, cast by Charles &amp; George Mears in 1850.
Governance.
The village falls in the 'Highnam with Haw Bridge' electoral ward. This ward starts in the north at Forthampton and stretches south to Minsterworth. The total ward population at the 2011 census was 4,206.

Sea Star Awards

The Sea Star Awards (Spanish: "Premios Estrella de Mar") are presented annually for the best achievements in theatre and other entertainment events during the summer season in the resort city of Mar del Plata, Argentina.
History.
Around 1973, the entertainment activities in Mar del Plata’s summer, such as theatrical plays, the so-called "café-concerts", circuses, and recitals, reached a degree of development that made it one of the most profitable investments of the summer season. The Municipal Agency of Tourism took account of the situation, and it established the awards, namely the "Estrella de Mar" (Sea Star), to promote the quality of the spectacles and to attract the interest of entrepreneurs. Although the mainstream stage was in the hands of national-level actors and producers, the contest is a genuine local product. The following two decades consolidated the prestige of the awards, and the producers and directors see "Estrella the Mar" as formidable publicity for their works and careers.
Categories.
The main categories are for best actor, best actress, breakthrough artist, best director, best screenplayer and best local play. The trophy consists of a bronze-covered starfish. The ceremony takes place the second Monday of February each year.

Liam Coyle (footballer, born 1968)

Liam Coyle (born 21 May 1968) is a former Northern Irish footballer.
Club career.
Coyle made his League of Ireland debut for Finn Harps on the opening day of the 1987-88 League of Ireland First Division season at Buckley Park against EMFA on 13 September 1987. After 3 goals in 9 total appearances he moved to his home town club making his Derry debut alongside Tim Dalton, Kevin Brady, Paul Doolin and Noel Larkin at Finn Park in an Ulster Tyre Cup game on 24 July 1988. His first goal came in a friendly against Clyde F.C. on 7 August.
Liam Coyle really burst onto the League of Ireland scene during the 1988–89 League of Ireland Premier Division season scoring a hat-trick against Cobh Ramblers on his Derry League debut on 6 November. He was also crowned Young Player of the Year, finished the season as "Treble" winner with Derry, and was capped by Northern Ireland in an end-of-season friendly with Chile (following in the footsteps of his father, Fay Coyle).
After starring in a 1989-90 European Cup tie against S.L. Benfica in a league game at Dundalk in September 1989 Coyle sustained a knee injury which turned out to be a condition called osteochondritis dissecans. On doctors' advice he retired at the end of that season. His testimonial was held against Newcastle United on 8 May 1990 at the Brandywell Stadium.
However Coyle never gave up believing that he wouldn't play again. He made an abortive comeback with Coleraine in September 1990, but lasted just one match. Coyle then turned to a faith-healer, and in combination with heavy knee strapping, started playing again for Brandywell Harps where he was spotted by Omagh Town manager Roy McCreadie.
He agreed to sign for Omagh for the 1992-93 Irish League season and made his Irish League debut on 16 August at Carrick Rangers scoring in a 3–2 win.
He had an astounding season playing more games (43) than any other player and ending up with a total of 23 goals.
When McCreadie left new manager Paul Kee signed Coyle for another year but after one league game he was sold to Derry for £10,000 in August 1993, and soon enough was showing the skills and trickery that had brought him such acclaim as a youngster. Coyle scored on his 100th competitive appearance for Derry in November 1994. He added further FAI Cup and League Cup medals to his collection, and was Ireland's double player of the year in 1995.
In December 1995 Coyle moved to Glentoran in a £37,000 deal, a record between Irish clubs. Although scoring on his debut against Cliftonville F.C. he was unhappy about leaving the Brandywell behind and would later describe it as the "low point" of his career. He lasted just six months at the Oval, picking up an Irish Cup medal, before being allowed to leave. Glens' manager Tommy Cassidy put it like this, "(Coyle) is one of the most skilful Irish players in history, but he had to go – he was missing training and other players were taking note". Coyle returned to Derry City for a combined fee of £42,000 (that also included Declan Devine), and immediately helped the Candystripes to another League of Ireland title.
As the years moved on Coyle continued to regularly find the net until the injuries began to take their toll. In April 2002 he scored in the final of the FAI League Cup which Derry lost on penalties. However, in October 2002 he scored his only FAI Cup Final goal in his fifth appearance, as Derry defeated Shamrock Rovers 1–0. His last ever goal for the club proved to be even more important. In December 2003 Derry found themselves in a promotion-relegation play-off with near neighbours Finn Harps. With the game in extra-time it was the 35-year-old Coyle who came off the bench to score the winner, and maintain Derry's Premier Division status.
In January 2004, following years of playing through the pain barrier, Coyle announced his retirement from playing. He had scored a then club record 112 goals in almost 400 games for Derry (since overtaken by Mark Farren), and was acclaimed from all-quarters as the greatest player in their history. He stayed at the Brandywell as Chief Scout, and has since made clear his ambitions to one day manage the club.
International career.
Like his father, Fay, who also played with Derry, Coyle played internationally for Northern Ireland. He appeared in the green jersey on one occasion against Chile in 1989, although his pride on that occasion was tempered by a less than welcome reception from some Northern Ireland fans. He was quoted as saying: "While standing for the English national anthem, a section of the supporters were giving me dogs abuse, calling me a Provo and shouting 'Go back to Derry, you Fenian scum. But I never regretted playing for Northern Ireland."
Honours.

HMS Medway (1928)

HMS "Medway" (Pennant F25) was the first purpose-built submarine depot ship constructed for the Royal Navy. She was built by Vickers Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness during the late 1920s. The ship served on the China Station before the Second World War and was transferred to Egypt in early 1940. Ordered to evacuate Alexandria in the face of the German advance after the Battle of Gazala in May 1942, "Medway" sailed for Lebanon at the end of June, escorted by a light cruiser and seven destroyers. Her strong escort could not protect her; on 30 June a German submarine torpedoed and sank her.
Description and construction.
"Medway" was designed to support up to 18 and s in peacetime and an additional three submarines during wartime. She carried three QF 4-inch Mk IV deck guns as spares together with 144 torpedoes to resupply her submarines. The ship proved to be less top-heavy than anticipated and had the enormously high metacentric height of at full load. Built with bilge keels only deep, "Medway" once rolled 42° each way with a period of nine seconds, losing her main topmast. Her bilge keels were subsequently increased in depth to .
She was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . The ship displaced at standard load and up to at (full load). Her crew numbered 400 officers and ratings; she could also accommodate up to 1,335 additional men.
The ship was powered by MAN diesel engines rated at , driving two shafts, and had a top speed of about . "Medway" carried of diesel fuel for herself and an additional for her submarines. Figures for her range are not available. The ship had five diesel generators for electrical power and special provisions to recharge submarine batteries.
She was armed with two low-angle guns in single mounts and four quick-firing Mk V 4-inch anti-aircraft guns, also in single mounts. The latter guns were controlled by a High-Angle Control System mounted above the bridge. "Medway" was protected by an internal anti-torpedo bulge which incorporated a water jacket of . Amidships a torpedo bulkhead was located 13 feet inboard that inclined outwards above the waterline. The main deck was 1.5 inches thick amidships.
"Medway" was ordered on 14 September 1926 as part of the 1925/26 Naval Estimates. The ship was laid down in April 1927 by the Vickers Armstrong shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness. The ship was launched on 19 July 1928. Captain Colin Cantlie was appointed as the first commander of the new ship on 1 January 1929. The ship was completed on 3 July 1929.
After completion, HMS "Medway" began Harbour Acceptance Trials and Sea Acceptance Trials, known in the Royal Navy as HATs and SATs. A report in The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser on 27 July 1929 notes that HMS "Medway" was undergoing trials.
Career.
HMS "Medway" served on the China Station before the start of the Second World War. She had taken over from HMS Titania in 1929/30 as the submarine depot ship for the 4th Submarine Flotilla. HMS "Medway" took her place in Hong Kong as the depot ship for the 4th Submarine Flotilla. Under the command of Capt. Colin Cantlie HMS "Medway" sailed to Hong Kong with six O-Class submarines of the Odin group. They were:
The submarine flotilla was enlarged in 1930.
HMS "Medway" was under refit at Singapore from September 1939 through February 1940. Upon completion of the refit, "Medway" sailed for Hong Kong where she remained until she departed for Alexandria on 2 April. She arrived there on 3 May and thereafter supported the 1st Submarine Flotilla, which operated in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Two years later, Vice-Admiral Henry Harwood, Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, ordered all non-essential ships to leave Alexandria in June 1942 as he was preparing to demolish the port facilities there to prevent their capture by the advancing Panzer Army Africa. "Medway" loaded stores and 1,135 personnel on 29 June to establish a new base at Beirut, Lebanon and sailed later that day for Beirut. Accompanied by the Greek ship , "Medway" was escorted by the light cruiser and the destroyers , , , , , , and . The next day, off Port Said, fired two torpedoes that sank "Medway"; 30 men were lost in the sinking. 47 of the 90 spare torpedoes aboard floated free of the wreck and were salvaged.

Die Zukunft ("The Future") has been the name of three newspapers.
Die Zukunft was a German social-democratic weekly (1892–1923) founded and edited by Maximilian Harden. It published allegations of homosexuality against Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg, leading to the Eulenburg affair in Wilhelmine Germany.
Die Zukunft was also the name of an exile German language paper, both anti-Nazi and anti-Stalinist in its politics, which was founded in 1938, and was based in Paris and edited by Arthur Koestler and Willi Münzenberg. Olof Aschberg provided the funds for launching this weekly political broadsheet. It ceased publication with the Nazi occupation of France in 1940.
Die Zukunft is also a Yiddish magazine published in the United States. Founded in New York in 1892, as an organ of the Socialist Labor Party, "Die Zukunft" was one of the first serious Yiddish periodicals to be published anywhere and the oldest still appearing at the turn of the 21st century. "Die Zukunft", for many years a publication of the New York-based Congress for Jewish Culture, continues to appear, albeit approximately twice a year, publishing poetry, literary reviews and essays in Yiddish.

Eesti Gaas

Eesti Gaas AS, branded internationally as Elenger, is an energy company with headquarters in Tallinn, Estonia. The company's main activity is selling and distributing of natural gas in Estonian, Latvian, Finnish, and Lithuanian markets. Eesti Gaas product portfolio includes also LNG, CNG, and electricity, including solar energy.
History.
The predecessor of Eesti Gaas was established in 1948, and it was the first gas transport company in Estonia. The company however traces its history to 1865 when the was opened, which used coal imported from England and gasified there. From 1948–1957 it transported Estonian oil shale gas through the Kohtla-Järve – Leningrad pipeline to Leningrad, Later the pipeline was used in traverse mode to transport Russian natural gas to Estonia.
From 1963–1988, the company existed as the "General Administration of Gasification" under the Council of Ministers of the Estonian SSR. In 1988, the name 'Eesti Gaas' was first introduced, and in 1990, it became a state enterprise. In 1993, AS Eesti Gaas was incorporated. The company was partly privatized in 1993–1995. In 1993, a 30% stake in Eesti Gaas was transferred to Lentransgaz (now: Gazprom Transgaz Saint Petersburg), a subsidiary of Gazprom, to eliminate the gas debt dispute. In 1994, Ruhrgas (later: E.ON Ruhrgas) acquired about 15% of the company's shares while the management of the company, together with other private investors and the UK-based Baltic Republic Fund, acquired 7.5% of shares both. As a result, the government of Estonia kept a 39% stake. In December 1996, Ruhrgas increased its stake to 21%; 12% was sold to the public. In January 1999, the remaining state-owned shares were sold. Ruhrgas increased its stake up to 32%, Gazprom kept its 30% stake, and Neste (later Fortum) got a 10% stake. Later that year, Itera (now part of Rosneft) Latvian branch acquired nearly 10% stake from the Baltic Republic Fund. In following years, Gazprom increased its stake up to 37%, E.ON up to 33.66%, and Fortum up to 17.7% by buying shares from private investors. In 2014, E.ON sold its stake to Fortum, which became the largest shareholder with 51.4% stake. In February 2016, it was announced that Fortum will sell its stake to Trilini Energy, a company controlled by the investment firm Infortar, the major shareholder of the shipping company Tallink. Later, Trilini also acquired 50.9% of the shares owned previously by Gazprom and 1.15% of the shares owned by minority shareholders.
In 1998, all regional subsidiaries of Eesti Gaas were merged into the parent company. In December 2004, the gas infrastructure construction activities were transferred to the separate subsidiary, AS EG Ehitus. In 2005, the gas grid services (transmission and distribution) were transferred to the newly established subsidiary company EG Võrguteenus. In 2013, the distribution network was separated from EG Võrguteenus into a newly established subsidiary of Eesti Gaas, AS Gaasivõrgud. In 2014, to implement the EU third energy package EG Võrguteenus was separated from Eesti Gaas.
In 2013, Eesti Gaas started to sell electricity.
In January 2018, Eesti Gaas started supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the Tallink's ferry "Megastar". In October 2018, Eesti Gaas announced that it will order 6,000-cubic-metre LNG barge for bunkering of ships in the northern and eastern part of the Baltic Sea. The barge would be ready by 2020, and it will be built by Damen Group.
Operations.
Eesti Gaas imports, sells and distributes pipeline natural gas, as also compressed natural gas (CNG), including compressed biomethan, as fuel for vehicles and liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel for ships. In addition to Estonia, Eesti Gaas also sells energy in Latvia, Lithuania and Finland.
Eesti Gaas has 11 CNG stations in Estonia which sell also biomethane. It provides LNG bunkering services to LNG-powered ships in Tallinn, Helsinki, and Hanko. The company delivers LNG by trucks from the LNG plant in Pskov in Russia and the Klaipeda LNG terminal in Lithuania, as also from Finland and Poland.
Eesti Gaas' subsidiary AS Gaasivõrk owns and operates the natural gas distribution network in Estonia. Eesti Gaas also sells electricity and owns stakes in solar parks with a total capacity around 4 MW.
In 2021 received its first LNG bunkering ship which was named Optimus.

Qin schools

A qin school (琴派 "qin pai" in Chinese) is a school of guqin players that play in a style that is different from other styles. 
People often talk about regional styles because such a model simplifies things—and because it is still somewhat applicable, though less so now than 100 years ago. Generally guqin is highly individualistic so players' approaches will be very personal.
Styles and schools.
These are the main schools in China:
Today the three main centers of guqin are Beijing, the Jiangnan area (lower Yangtze valley, including Shanghai) and Sichuan (especially Chengdu). Most major masters as of the 1950s were located in Beijing or Jiangnan; before that, they had been more concentrated in Jiangnan. For instance, Zha Fuxi and Wu Jinglüe spent many years living and teaching in Jiangnan before being relocated to Beijing for official duties. "Regional styles" as of 50–60 years ago would be rather different from "regional styles" in the present day, owing to the importance of a few masters and the conservatories in Beijing and Shanghai. Presently, given the strength of the conservatory system, "northern and southern conservatory styles" probably deserve their own status, separate from the older regional styles.
Regional styles.
As far as older regional styles, the best-known ones are from Jiangnan and Sichuan. Some have relocated several times, like the Zhucheng/Mei'an style.
Major living Jiangnan lineages include Guangling, Zhe (Xumen) and Wumen. Others, like a "Jinling" style centered in Nanjing, don't really seem to exist anymore—though there's always an old master or two as counterexample.
Generally (stereotypically), the Jiangnan styles are thought of as rather light and elegant. Guangling is very abstract, even "floating", and today the southern conservatory style is the more "light and elegant" of the conservatory styles. 
Shu/Fanchuan school.
Sichuan, as early as the Tang dynasty, was perceived as having qin play characterized by rushing, tumbling energy. 
The modern form of the school was largely founded by Zhang Kongshan in the late 19th century; his inheritors have been very numerous. There are two branches: one branch through Ye Jiafu whose lineage is embodied by Zeng Chengwei, and the other is through Gu Yucheng whose lineage was embodied by Gu Meigeng. Today the main representative of the school is Zeng Chengwei, who has a very focused, straightforward style.
As the Sichuan style fanned out into other areas of China (as it seemed to do rather successfully in the early 20th century), it became known as "Fanchuan", whose connotation is something like "Chuan – Everywhere". 
Zhucheng/Mei'an schools.
These schools started in Shandong, with a lot of folk influence and energy. "Zhucheng" still refers to the sub-set of players who stayed in Shandong. Xu Lisun became the doyen of the "Mei'an" style when he moved to Nantong, in Jiangnan. From there he taught many of the living Jiangnan players, directly or indirectly. In addition, a student of his named Wu Zonghan moved to Taiwan (in 1949?) and has made Taiwan (and by extension Hong Kong) a major reservoir of Mei'an influence.
Other schools.
Moving down the east coast of China, we have Fujian. The "Min" school, of which Chen Changlin calls himself an inheritor, seems largely dead today. In Guangdong there is the Lingnan school, whose major player is Xie Daoxiu. Much cannot be said about these, though Lingnan playing is very interesting. 
Miniature "regional styles" abound and are gathered around particular important teachers. For instance, many in Hong Kong studied from Cai Deyun, who has a very distinctive style ultimately derived from Sichuan.
Conservatory styles.
From the early 20th century, as communication and travel within China improved as well as the adoption of modern musical teaching standards, a new conservatory style emerged. Typically, this style can be identified by the very precise and pitch-accurate play on the qin involving subtle vibrato on most notes and very fast movement of the hand and fingers. Whereas traditional styles are typically soft and fluid, conservatory style is very straight and sharp. 
The "southern conservatory style" is basically what goes on at the Shanghai Conservatory where qin is concerned. A number of masters (including Zhang Ziqian, Wei Zhongle, Shen Caonong, Gu Meigeng, and others) taught there in the 1950s, and Gong Yi has been the doyen since then. He has numerous students; to some extent "southern conservatory style" reduces to "Gong Yi style", just like "Wumen" reduces to "Wu Zhaoji style". Gong Yi has very distinctive ideas and has done major interesting work.
Little is known about Beijing styles prior to the 1950s; the "big three" of mid-century Beijing all apparently had styles hailing from elsewhere. Guan Pinghu apparently based his playing on southern styles, though he studied with masters from all over; Wu Jinglüe and Zha Fuxi were both southerners. It's important to realize that there are lineages and micro-lineages and associations among all masters. For instance, there was some kind of long association between Zha Fuxi and Peng Qingshou (both from Hunan?) that may have been artistically productive. In any event, if there is a "Beijing style" today, it is largely the "northern conservatory style".
Northern conservatory style has two main representatives today: Li Xiangting and Wu Wenguang. The primary older masters contributing to the making of this style were Wu Jinglüe, Zha Fuxi, and Guan Pinghu. Generally, the northern conservatory style is heavier, harder, and more intense than the southern conservatory style. Li Xiangting is of course known for being very hard and athletic in his playing; Wu Wenguang, while rather lighter, still has a more intense and serious tone than Gong Yi.
Individual style.
On top of the regional and conservatory styles, there is the style which does not fit into either. This is the style that many qin players would play since they may either have been taught by numerous teachers and so do not have a main regional style, or are mostly self-taught. It is from this that some interesting and sometimes eccentric styles exist since there are no constraints from the expectation of peers or teachers.

Prix Constantin

The Prix Constantin is an annual French music prize awarded to the best album of an artist who has come to prominence during the course of the past year. It was inaugurated in 2002, following the example of the Mercury Music Prize, as an attempt to bring to light artists who have not had major media coverage ("the talents of today and tomorrow"). It is therefore open to individuals or groups who have not yet had a gold album, with the exception of the nominated album. Its basic purpose is to help newer artists who are not very popular to gain publicity. All albums produced in France in the past year are admissible, without restriction on the nationality or language of expression of the artist. The winner is decided by a jury, headed by a musician, which contains representatives from the press, radio, television and record stores.
The Prix Constantin is named after the record industry figure Philippe Constantin, who died in 1996.

The People Versus

The People Versus was a British game show that aired on ITV from 13 August 2000 to 18 June 2002. Series 1 was hosted by Kirsty Young and Series 2 by Kaye Adams. The central format was that the questions were sent in by the viewers.
Formats.
Series 1.
For every question the contestants got correct, they won £5,000. The rules were: In each round the players were shown five questions from one of their specialist subjects. In Round One, each contestant had to attempt and answer correctly one of those five questions - "one of five to stay alive". In Round Two, on a different subject they had to answer two correctly to stay in, Round Three, three, Round Four, four and finally in Round Five, they had to answer all five. In each round, the player could, if they wanted, earn more cash by answering more questions than the quota required, again for £5,000 a piece. To help, each player was shown all five questions at the start. Each player was also given three 'flips'. If a player wanted to use a flip, they could substitute any of the five given questions for another one. Also, if they had the cash, they could elect to 'buy' answers to questions at £10,000 a time.
Finishing Round 5 meant the contestant would begin again at Round 1. There was no limit on the amount of money someone could win which theoretically meant someone could win more than a million pounds, the top prize of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?", although no contestant ever won anywhere near this amount of money.
If a person got their question wrong, they lost all money in that round and their seat in the game went to the person who set the question.
Series 2.
Studio contestants were asked general knowledge questions set by the public. The rounds were as follows:
The contestant had a four-minute time limit to finish the rounds. Running out of time meant they lost.
If the contestant was stuck on a question, he or she could pass (which discards the question for good), but if they cannot pass any more, they must use a 'Flip'. A contestant had three flips at their disposal. These substituted the question for an alternative one on their specialist subject.
Finishing Round 5 meant that the contestant would bank the £3,000 and have the chance to restart from Round 1 again with their Flips restored. As in the first series there is an unlimited amount of money to be won. The highest sum of money won on the daytime version was £15,900.
If a contestant answered a question incorrectly or could not give an answer within the time limit, then they were knocked out of the game. The person who set the question won £100. (Later in the series this changed to £50 for a Round 1 knockout, with no money being awarded for an elimination in a later round.) The Bong Game was then played.
The studio contestant had the choice of 3 Bong games. One of these three games did not have a bong in it all and went all the way to the money he had in play. An automated voice read out increasing amounts of money. The aim was to stop the voice before the bong sounded. The contestant had to press a button to stop the voice and win whatever was shown on the screen.
If the contestant managed to beat the bong, the rest of the money in play went to the person who caught the studio contestant out. If the studio player failed to beat the bong, then they would win nothing and the member of the public won all of the money in play. The contestant then found out where the bong would have come in.
Transmissions.
Series 1 was broadcast each weekday around 20.30. From Series 2 the series was moved to early evening broadcasting each weekday around 17.00 until 2 November.

Church of St. Michael the Archangel, Kaunas

St. Michael the Archangel's Church or the Garrison Church (; ) is a Roman Catholic church in the city of Kaunas, Lithuania, closing the perspective of the Laisvės alėja, the main pedestrian street. It was built between 1891 and 1895 when Kaunas was part of the Russian Empire, in Neo-Byzantine style largely for the use of the Russian Orthodox garrison of Kaunas Fortress.
History.
The construction of "military" or "garrison" Orthodox churches by the Russian government in former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth lands had started after the suppression of the November Uprising of 1830-31, and peaked during the reign of emperor Alexander III of Russia. Initially the site of this church had been intended to be used for a Catholic church, but these plans had been abandoned after the Uprising. 
The church was designed as an Orthodox cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in 1890 by K. H. Lymarenko; it was authorized for construction on November 10 that year. Official groundbreaking was celebrated on 29 June 1891. The cathedral was completed in four years (unusually quickly for its size), and was inaugurated on 17 September 1895. Later Lymarenko's plan was modified by David Grimm from St. Petersburg. The church's decorative scheme was outlined by Griaznov and implemented by craftsman from Vilnius. Most of the construction was carried out by workers from Chernigov Governorate, and its art-work was implemented by craftsmen from St. Petersburg.
As usual for military churches of the period, the construction of Kaunas cathedral was financed equally by the Military Ministry and by donations from army servicemen. Completion of the church finalized the administrative building complex of the Kaunas Fortress; it symbolized less the presence of Orthodox Christians than the imperial authority of the Russian government. It was also believed that the church would reduce interdenominational frictions.
After the fall of the Kaunas Fortress during World War I the Germans cut down the church bells and transported them to Germany. The church stayed closed until 1919.
In the interwar period the cathedral became a Roman Catholic church of the Lithuanian garrison of Kaunas. There were voices urging the demolition of the church as it was labeled as without architectural value.
During the rule of the Soviet Union, it was used as an art gallery. Nowadays it serves as a Roman Catholic church. The other popular name of the church is "Soboras".
Architecture.
Kaunas cathedral stood out among similar military churches by its size (it was designed to fit 2,000 worshipers) and its unusual architecture - employing triple Corinthian columns in an otherwise typical "neo-Byzantine" (Romanesque) five-dome design. In total the exterior has 266 large and small columns and pilasters. This eclectic spin-off of mainstream "Byzantine" architecture (the so-called "Roman Byzantine" style) was hailed by contemporary architectural journalists, but never gained popularity.
As built, the cathedral reached 50 meters height; it was finished in three shades of sandstone color with equal-armed cross ornament. For the interior the structure relied on four load-bearing pylons designed to appear slimmer and lighter than in reality. The space between external and internal shells of the main dome was filled with hollow clay resonators. Cut from granite, floor tesseras were bought from abroad. In the dome above the altar were images of two Archangels or evangelists. The main altar's stained glass showed God's entrance to heaven. Smaller domes housed bells; one of them had been founded in 1681. Just inside the church and to the right is the entrance to the catacombs, which are accessible to the public.
Museum for the blind.
The Kaunas Museum for the Blind is located underneath the church. It originated as a 2005 art installation - "21st century catacombs" – designed for the blind, the visually impaired, and the sighted. The project was overseen by the Lithuanian sculptor, Robertas Antinis, and architect, Linas Tuleikis.

Mineral del Monte

Mineral del Monte, commonly called Real del Monte () or El Real, is a small mining town, and one of the 84 municipalities of Hidalgo, in the State of Hidalgo in east-central Mexico.
It is located at an altitude of on a mountain pass, it is the highest town in Hidalgo. As of 2020, the municipality had a total population of 14,324 — with Mauricio Rodriguez Téllez as head of the municipal council.
Etymology.
Mineral Del Monte was originally known as "Magosti" by native Otomi amerindians. The name is a compound noun of "Ma" and "Gohtsi", roughly translating to "high pass"; e.g. the site of the mountain pass between Huasteca (to the east) and territories of the Otomi state of Metztitlan (to the north), and city of Tenochtitlán (Mexico City) in the west. This historic road was first seized by the Spanish in colonisation that followed the defeat of the Aztec Empire in 1519 and renamed ""Real del Monte"; from the Spanish "real" meaning "kingly/royal"" and "monte" for mountain. The vernacular usage of the original Otomi "Magosti" continued and eventually transmuted to "El Hiloche", this name survives but is now only applied to the forest to the west of the town. 
"Mineral del monte" literally translates to "mineral mountain"
History.
The Mine District of Pachuca—Real del Monte has a long and rich heritage. The mines in the district are conservatively estimated to have produced 1.2 billion Troy ounces of silver and 6.2 million ounces of gold. That is 6% of the silver mined throughout the world during the last five centuries. Some of the mines have continued limited production until the present day.
Gold and silver were discovered after the Spanish conquest of Mexico in the 1520s. The Colonial Spanish began mining in the 16th century in the Pachuca area, but the mines were suffering from flooding by 1725. In 1741, Pedro Romero de Terreros and Jose Alejandro Bustamante started a drainage program using an adit.
The native Mexican Amerindians were often enslaved to work the mines, despite the Royal mandate for Colonial Jesuit Reductions and later Franciscan Indian Reductions. In addition, Africans were imported to replace Indian slaves. The Real del Monte 1766 Strike is considered by many to be the first real labor strike in North American history.
The town's steep streets, stairways and small squares are lined with low buildings, some dating back to the Spanish colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain period (1500s - 1810). The older houses with high sloping roofs and chimneys in town show the 19th century Cornish and English influence.
19th-century Cornish miners.
Mining.
The Cornish role in the development of Mexican silver mining is significant. The Cornish brought "new" mining technology of the Industrial Revolution in the 1820s, reviving Mexican silver mining. Especially important was British equipment to drain mine tunnels flooded by groundwater since the Spanish period. The majority of immigrant miners came from the Cornish Central Mining District of Camborne-Redruth-Gwennap in Cornwall. The Cornish firm that ran the Real del Monte-Pachuca mines between 1824 and 1848, employed 350 Cornish miners and, when the mines were in full operation, the municipality was once the richest in the state.
One of the leading personalities in 19th-century Mexico mining was Francis Rule, from Camborne in Cornwall. Known as "El Rey de la Plata" (Silver King), Rule left a mark on the Pachucan cityscape, with civic generosity to his adopted homeland. His opinion could be a barometer for the rise and fall of mining shares. He became very wealthy from his numerous mining interests in the district. One was the Santa Gertrudis Mine, which by 1898 was one of the most productive in the State of Hidalgo under Cornish management. 
Four extant Cornish mine engine houses, and the 'English' Cemetery ("Panteon Inglés") containing the graves of hundreds of Cornishmen in Pachuca, bear witness to the Cornish contributions to Mexican silver mining for over a century. The cemetery is undergoing restoration following storm damage in 2016.
Sports.
It was the Cornish who first introduced soccer/football to Mexico (Pachuca). The first game of what would go on to be Mexico's national pastime ("futbol"), was first played in Mexico by Cornish miners at Pachuca in 1900, a fact that is celebrated each year. The first soccer club in the country, the Pachuca Athletic Club, was also founded in that year. The first team consisted of Charles Dawe, John Dawe, James Bennetts, John Bennetts, William Blamey, Richard Sobey, William Bragg, William Thomas, Percy Bunt, Lionel Bunt, Albert Pengelly and William Pengelly, a decidedly 'Cornish' team. The Pachuca club encouraged the formation of teams in Mexico City and Orizaba, the first championship was played in 1902 and 'El Pachuca' won the 1904-05 tournament. Also rugby union, cricket, tennis, polo, chess among other sports, were introduced here.
Methodism was introduced to Roman Catholic Mexico by the Cornish upon their arrival, and most of the descendants of the Cornish in Real del Monte and Pachuca are of Methodist faith. They brought Methodist Christianity to other major Mexican cities as they relocated. Mexican remittances helped to build the Wesleyan Chapel in Redruth, Cornwall, in the 1820s.
Geology.
The Pachuca-Mineral del Monte silver mining district is at the southern end of a metalliferous mineral zone that extends northwest to encompass Mineral del Chico to the Zimapan lead-mining district to the northwest. The ore deposits occur in the volcanic Tertiary Pachuca Group, principally andesite-rhyolite flow series with intervening tuff beds. The deposits are epithermal sulfide minerals within steeply dipping normal fault veins. Acanthite and argentite are the principal silver ore minerals. Between 1973 through 1981, Compania De Real Del Monte Y Pachuca, S.A., produced 24,762,667.2 Troy ounces of silver and 133,950.33 Troy ounces of gold.
The richest vein of silver was the Veta Vizcaina, or the Vizcaina Vein, which extended 5 km to the east of Real del Monte. Productive mines along this vein included the San Francisco, Santa Agueda (1767), Santa Teresa (1734), La Joya (1734), San Cayetano (1751), Dolores (1734), and La Palma (1734). By 1750, Pedro Terreros had control of this lucrative vein. Production continued until the mid-1770s.
Tourism.
Real del Monte was named a "Pueblo Mágico" by the federal government, for its unique historical qualities, aesthetics, and traditions. There are significant examples of Spanish Colonial architecture, in individual buildings and via the overall cityscape, that are preserved in the town.
Little Cornwall.
The twin silver mining settlements of Pachuca and Real del Monte (Mineral del Monte) in the State of Hidalgo have been marketed as 'Mexico's Little Cornwall' by the Mexican Embassy in London since 2007. This represents the first attempt by the Spanish-speaking part of the Cornish diaspora to establish formal links with Cornwall. The Camborne Town Council voted on 19 July 2007 to twin with Pachuca and on 16 August 2007 a public meeting confirmed the earlier decision of Redruth Town Council to twin with Real del Monte. The formal twinning ceremony took place at Mineral del Monte in July 2008 during the visit of the Cornish Mexican Cultural Society.
Real del Monte is a home of the paste in Mexico, with 30 "paste" producers in the town. A little larger than cocktail pasties common to the UK, the Mexican-made versions are widely varied including: meat and potato, black bean, shredded chicken, and sausage, all heavily laced with chillies plus a range of sweet pasties including: pineapple, apple, strawberry, and blackberry. A number have developed into national chains with shops in towns and cities across Mexico. The town of Real del Monte is the site of a museum of Cornish pasties, opened in 2011.
In October 2009 the town of Real del Monte (twinned with Redruth, Cornwall) held the first International Pasty Festival (Festival Internacional del Paste). Organised by the Municipality of Real del Monte, the paste producers and the Cornish Mexican Cultural Society Chapter Mexico, the Festival was a great success drawing an estimated 8,000 visitors to the town for the three-day event. A coach of visitors travelled from Cuernavaca, some four hours away, and another from Mexico City. The Festival was opened by the President Municipal of Real del Monte, Ing. Omar Mariano Skewes. During the opening speeches it was stated that "Cornish people rebuilt our shattered mining industry giving us work and now again, when we have lost that industry, the Cornish have given us pastes and a new source of income."
As is usual on festival days in this town, the programme commenced with a visit to the Cornish Cemetery and a guided tour by Bridget Galsworthy of the British Society, followed by wreath-laying at the Miner´s Monument. The main street was transformed with a long line of tented stands where 'pastes' of all descriptions were produced and a large stage next to the Miners' Memorial provided dance and other entertainments throughout the Festival.
Notable people.
At the end of the 19th century, the engineer Andrés Aldasoro worked in the Las dos Estrellas mine. Two of his sons, Juan Pablo Aldasoro and Eduardo Aldasoro Suárez, were born in Mineral del Monte. As adults, they became pioneers in aviation, and both became members of the Early Birds of Aviation. Alfred C. Crowle was the Cornish born miner who emigrated to Mexico and in 1935 became manager to the national Mexican football team.
John Edgar Benjamin Vial was a Cornish-Mexican who fought in the British Imperial Forces during World War I. He died in the Battle of Somme. For his service he received the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. There is a monument in his honor at the "Panteon Inglés".
Demographics.
According to the 2020 census by INEGI, the town had a population of 11,149 which accounted for 77.83% of the municipality's inhabitants. There were 5255 men and 5894 women: a ratio of 89.16 men per 100 women. There were 2499 privately owned homes. 
In terms of language and ethnicity; only 38 spoke a indigenous language (0.34%). 1.17% (130 people) were afro-mexican. Catholisism was by far the most common religion with 9579 declarations (85.91%), but 813 were protestant (7.29%; possibly Cornish methodist) and 15 declared other religions. 730 declared no religion.
Mines.
All mines in the municipality extracted silver ore which was then dressed using the patio process. The mines were originally worked by indigenous Otomini later by the Spanish from the 16th to 19th centuries. From 1824 many of the mines became British interests but these were soon renationalised an in turn became worked by American companies in the 20th century. The last mine to operate was Mina San José La Rica which closed in 2005.
Engine Houses.
The municipality is home to two surviving Cornish engine houses: at Dolores Mine and Acosta Mine. A further two, no longer extant, are known to have existed.

Payne also helped Maryland to its first-ever ACC Tournament championship in 1996. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in biology.
Professional.
In 1997, Payne signed with the New Orleans Riverboat Gamblers of the USISL A-League. Payne began as a backup to Tom Dutra but became the starter after Dutra was injured early in the season. That season, the Riverboat Gamblers won the Central Division, but fell in the second round of the playoffs. He then moved to the Netherlands where he played during 1998. In February 1999, Payne was an undrafted invitee to the Chicago Fire training camp, but was released during the pre-season. He then signed with the Maryland Mania of the USL A-League. In April 1999, he was called up to D.C. United of Major League Soccer when backup Mark Simpson was injured. He played on exhibition, but no regular season games before returning to the Mania the first week of July. On July 31, 1999, the Colorado Rapids signed Payne for the remainder of the season. He played fourteen minutes in one game. The Rapids waived him on February 24, 2000, after acquiring several goalies in the draft and through trades. Payne then signed with the Boston Bulldogs of the USL A-League. During the 2000 season, he played at least one game with the Cape Cod Crusaders. He was called up to the MetroStars as a backup goalie for three games early in the season when Mike Ammann was injured. He also spent time with the New England Revolution and Los Angeles Galaxy in July as a backup goalkeeper. In August 2000, the MetroStars signed Payne on loan and he played one game for them, allowing two goals in eight minutes. On February 5, 2001, the MetroStars drafted Payne in the sixth round (70th overall) in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. This gave them the rights to Payne for the upcoming season. In March 2001, the MetroStars released him during the preseason. He then moved to Derry City F.C. of the League of Ireland where he played eleven games at the end of the 2000–2001 season. During the 2001–2002 season, Payne was Derry City's Player of the Year. In 2002, he moved to SV Elversberg of Germany where he played two seasons. In 2004, he signed with Shamrock Rovers. Payne made his debut for The Hoops on September 11, 2004, against Cork City and went on to make 16 appearances. His last game was against St Patricks Athletic on May 13, 2005, where he had a nightmare game. Due to a team in decline he only kept one clean sheet in this time, against his old team Derry City.
Coach.
At the end of the 1997 USISL A-League season, Payne returned to the University of Maryland where he served as an assistant coach for the 1997 collegiate season. He then coached collegiately at George Washington in 1997–98 as the goalkeeper coach. Payne spent three seasons as the goalkeeper coach for the SV Elversberg U-16 team. While playing for Derry City F.C., he also served as the club's U-18 goalkeeper coach. In 2005, he left Ireland to become assistant coach with the Maryland Terrapins. In his first season back in College Park they won the National Championship for the first time since 1968. In the summer of 2006 and 2008, Payne served as an assistant coach for the U.S. U-20 team that played in the Milk Cup in Northern Ireland. In December 2009, Payne became the head coach at West Point. Payne and his wife, model Vanessa Payne, live in West Point, N.Y. They have two children, Harper Elizabeth Payne (born December 2009) and Kellen Payne.

Paste (pasty)

A paste () (known as an empanada or Inglesa in other Latin American countries: Argentina and Guatemala) is a small pastry produced in the state of Hidalgo in central Mexico and in the surrounding area. They are stuffed with a variety of fillings including potatoes and ground beef, apples, pineapple, sweetened rice, or other typical Mexican ingredients, such as tinga and mole.
The paste has its roots in the Cornish pasty introduced by miners and builders from Cornwall in the United Kingdom, who were contracted in the towns of Mineral del Monte (Real del Monte) and Pachuca in Hidalgo starting in 1824.
Festival.
The International Pasty Festival is held in Real del Monte for three days each October.

Jersey Railway

The Jersey Railway was originally a long standard gauge railway on Jersey in the Channel Islands. Opened in 1870, it was converted to narrow-gauge in 1884 and extended . The line closed in 1936. 
History.
In 1864, the States of Jersey passed a law authorising the construction of the island's first railway. This standard gauge line was constructed, connecting St. Helier to St. Aubin, and the first train ran 25 October 1870. This railway was not a success and the company declared bankruptcy in 1874. The railway continued to operate but passed through a succession of proprietors until 1883.
Meanwhile, the owner of a granite quarry near La Moye had petitioned to build a railway linking his quarry to St. Aubin. This law passed in June 1871 and the St Aubin &amp; La Moye Railway commenced construction to the narrow gauge of on Monday 11 August 1873 at a point near General Don’s Farm. However, the construction did not proceed to plan and in 1874 the states refused to allow an extension of time with the company, and the works were suspended. This resulted in 150 men being thrown out of employment. This line too, ran into financial problems and although construction trains ran on the section from La Moye to Pont Marquet, the company declared bankruptcy in 1878 before completion or opening to the public.
In 1883, the Jersey Railway and the partially completed St Aubin &amp; La Moye Railway were amalgamated into the Jersey Railways Company Limited. The St. Helier to St. Aubin line was relaid to gauge and the railway re-opened to passengers on 15 March 1884, initially operating as two separate sections until the two lines were connected at St. Aubin to form a complete railway. The first through service ran between St Helier and La Corbière on 31 August 1884.
In 1894 the "London Evening Standard" reported that an attempt to wreck a train running round St Aubin’s Bay was made by placing heavy stones on the rails. This was the third attempt within a few days.
This railway too hit financial difficulties and in 1895 entered voluntary liquidation.
In 1896, a new company, the Jersey Railways and Tramways Co. Ltd. was formed to take over the assets of the failed company. The railway was improved, with an extension to La Corbière Pavilion opening in 1899 and was successful up to the outbreak of the First World War. The railway continued during the war, but by 1917 traffic had declined significantly. 
In 1922 the decision was made to introduce railcars to reduce operating costs. In 1923 Sentinel-Cammell steam railcars were demonstrated on the railway. They accommodated 56 passengers, were long, weighed 14 tons and could be driven from either end. These helped the company to revive its fortunes in the mid-1920s with 1925 being the peak in terms of passengers carried and profitability. The Jersey Railway was not a typical sleepy narrow gauge railway, instead operating a very intensive commuter style timetable peaking at 32 trains in each direction in 1925, when almost 1.1 million passengers were carried.
By 1928, competition from buses and private cars was threatening the railway's future.
The decline was quite rapid, and by 1932 the winter service had been withdrawn. In October 1936, a fire destroyed the roof of St. Aubin station and consumed 16 carriages. The line did not reopen for the 1937 summer season, and all remaining locomotives and railcars were scrapped in 1937.
The States of Jersey purchased the route of the line from St Helier to La Corbière on 1 April 1937 for the sum of £25,000. The rails were lifted and the smaller stations demolished.
The route.
The Jersey railway, in its final form, was a single track route with passing places at the termini, Millbrook, St Aubin and Don Bridge.
The main station at the Weighbridge (now Liberation Square) in St Helier was the operating headquarters of the line and featured an impressive building, glass roof and two platforms.
The locomotive sheds and maintenance workshops were also at this location. The workshops were capable of very heavy repair work and the manufacture of carriages – the distance from the mainland made the railway very self-sufficient.
Between St Helier and St Aubin, the railway ran a picturesque route along the seafront – between the beach and main promenade road (Victoria Avenue).
Millbrook station featured two platforms and a footbridge. It was moved and rebuilt on a new site in 1912 to make way for an extension to the seafront promenade.
St Aubin station, the original limit of operations, had two platforms and another impressive glass roof. When the line was extended to La Moye in 1884, an additional platform was added, bypassing the original terminus that continued in use for the St Helier – St Aubin trains.
After St Aubin, the railway turned sharply inland through a rock-lined tunnel and climbed steeply away from the sea, rising over in with gradients as steep as 1 in 30. The summit was reached just after Don Bridge Station. The track then dropped towards La Corbière where the substantial granite-built station overlooked the lighthouse. La Corbière station had a loop line but only one passenger platform.
German occupation.
On 1 July 1940, German forces occupied Jersey, Hitler declaring that the Channel Islands would become an impregnable fortress.
Work was soon begun building gun emplacements, bunkers, tunnels, and sea walls.
To support this work, the occupying German army (Organisation Todt) re-opened almost the entire St. Helier to La Corbière line to gauge. This line was used for construction materials and never carried passengers. A branch line was built to serve the large granite quarries at Ronez in the north of the island. This joined the La Corbière line at Pont Marquet. At the St Helier end of the line, the original Weighbridge terminal was bypassed and the rails went direct to the dockside quays and linked with the 60 cm gauge lines in the east of the island (following the route of the old Jersey Eastern Railway which had closed in 1929).
Steam and diesel locomotives worked the line for the duration of the war but it seems to have fallen out of use by 1945 and the line was taken up at the cessation of hostilities by the liberating troops.
Proposed revival.
In January 2012, a proposal was made to reinstate of track between St Aubin and Corbière. An offer of a gauge steam locomotive has been made.
As of 2025, Jersey Western Railway Limited have begun efforts to return the full length of the railway between St. Helier and Corbière 
Remains.
It is possible to walk or cycle over the entire route of the Jersey Railway as a seafront promenade, cycle track, and walking and cycling trail now occupy the trackbed.
In St Helier, the 1901 headquarters and terminus building at the Weighbridge housed Jersey Tourism until 2007, although the trainshed has been demolished. The site behind the former terminus building is now Liberation Station, the main bus terminus.
The intermediate station at Millbrook (built 1912) is now the Old Station Cafe and the station building and hotel at St Aubin now serves as the Parish Hall of Saint Brelade. Beyond St Aubin, the tunnel built in 1899 to avoid some tight curves is still there, although much enlarged during the Second World War as a munitions store.
Walkers can view the trackbed and its bridges, embankments and cuttings right to La Corbière. The Old Station House at La Corbière, registered as a Building of Local Interest, was sold by the States of Jersey to the private sector in 2004. Planning permission was granted to convert the house into a modern architectural showpiece.
The locomotive nameplates are preserved by the National Railway Museum in York and locomotive No.5 'La Moye' is preserved intact in South Africa where she worked in industry until 1992. A coach body and artefacts are preserved at the Pallot Steam Museum in Jersey and other artefacts are on display in the Jersey Museum in St Helier.

Marc Ó Sé

Marc Ó Sé (born 25 April 1980) is an Irish sportsman. A teacher by profession, he works in the CBS in Tralee County Kerry, he played Gaelic football for the Kerry county team from 2002 until 2016 and played with his local club team An Ghaeltacht until 2018. He has played right across the back line for Kerry. His older brothers, Darragh and Tomás, also represented Kerry.
Playing career.
Early years: 2002–2005.
In his rookie season of 2002, Ó Sé impressed throughout the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in a Kerry team under the management of his uncle Páidí. In the final of that year he marked Diarmuid Marsden of Armagh. Marc was given a torrid time as Kerry let what looked like a certain win with 25 mins to go slip and lost by a single point, 1-12 to 0-14.
In 2003, Kerry reached the All-Ireland semi-final, but again suffered disappointment. After a terribly below par performance against a Tyrone team who used what analyst Pat Spillane (himself of Kerry origin) called "puke football" to suffocate Kerry,
2004 was a busy year for Ó Sé. First he lost the All Ireland Club Championship with his club. He then won the National League beating Galway in a cracking game by a single point. He starred in the 2004 campaign showing great defensive awareness and beautiful on the ball skill. Kerry won the title, defeating Mayo 1-20 to 2-09 in what was described as a 'rout'. Ó Sé's brother Tomás won the player of the year award, but despite his fine performances Ó Sé did not win an All-Star.
In 2005, Ó Sé continued to perform for Kerry who this time were narrowly defeated by Tyrone. Many people from around the country felt the fact that Kerry had not been tested in the championship in almost a year and a half, and the fact that this was Tyrone's 10th game of a gruelling campaign as key factors in the final result. Again Ó Sé was overlooked in the All Star selection despite a sterling campaign.
Middle years: 2006–2009.
Kerry bounced back in 2006. The team defeated Galway in the final of the National League again in a far less impressive game as the corresponding fixture 2 years earlier. Kerry were shocking in the Munster Championship, in which they were nearly defeated by minnows Waterford and eventually defeated in a replay against Cork. However, this proved to be a false dawn for the rest of Ireland as Kerry regrouped. They beat Longford in the qualifier and were written off for their quarter final against Armagh. Armagh and Tyrone were perceived as Kerry's bogey teams in recent years and Armagh were expected to deal with Kerry in a similar fashion as Tyrone had done the previous year. As it happened, Kerry produced a masterful second half display achieved a 10-point turnaround. Marc was immense and scored 2 glorious points from the back, many experts said that there were few forwards in the game who could have taken their scores as well. Kerry gained revenge against Cork in the Semi-Final before handing Mayo and even more severe beating than they had two years earlier. Kerry had the game wrapped up after only 10 minutes with a score of 2-04 to 0-00 and despite a mini revival by Mayo, Kerry won comprehensively, 4-15 to 3-05. Marc won an All-Star award in 2006.
In 2007, Ó Sé won the Munster championship with Kerry. The team advanced to the All-Ireland series, and reached the final, in which they beat Billy Morgan's Cork side 3-13 to 1-9. It was Kerry's 35th all-Ireland. Marc's performances were recognised as he won an All-Star and was named Texaco Footballer of the Year. His brothers Darragh and Tomás were also included, making it the first time three brothers had been selected for the All-Star team.
In 2008, Ó Sé reached the National League and Munster finals with Kerry, but lost both. The team went on to reach their fifth consecutive All-Ireland final, but lost to Tyrone by four points.
In 2009, Ó Sé won the All-Ireland again.
Later years: 2010–2014.
He won his fifth All Ireland medal in 2014 when Kerry defeated Donegal.
In October 2016, Ó Sé announced his retirement from Inter-county football.
In total Ó Sé won five-All-Ireland titles and 10 Munster titles and the Player of the Year in 2007 along with three All Star awards.

Latvijas Gāze

A/S Latvijas Gāze is a Latvian natural gas company, which deals in the importation and sale of natural gas.
Latvijas Gāze is owned by Gazprom (34%), Rietumu Bank (28.97%), Uniper Ruhrgas International (18.26%) and Itera-Latvija (16%). In January 2016 the Marguerite Fund acquired a 28.97% stake from E.ON.
The Latvia's gas transmission network was unbundled from the company in 2016 by establishing an independent transmission and storage company Conexus Baltic Grid. For operating the distribution network, Latvijas Gāze established the gas distribution system operator Gaso.
History.
In 1862, an artificial gas factory started operating in Riga, which produced fuel gas from coal for lighting the streets of Old Riga. Later, fuel gas was also used in gas stations and households. The second gas factory in Riga was opened in 1875. The Liepaja gas factory was opened in 1882. After the Second World War, in 1949, liquefied petroleum gas began to be used in Latvia, in 1961, the Main Gasification Board of the Council of Ministers of the LPSR was established, which was later reorganized into the State Gasification Committee of the LPSR. In 1962, a gas pipeline from Dashava in Ukraine reached Riga, and natural gas was used for the first time. In 1968, the Inčukalnas underground gas storage began to operate. In the 1970s, the Giprospecgaz institute in Leningrad prepared a perspective plan for gas supply in Latvia, which provided for the construction of new gas pipelines and compressor stations. In 1972, the Valdais-Pleskava-Riga gas pipeline was opened, which received gas from the Vuktila deposit in Western Siberia. In 1986, the construction of the main gas pipeline Saurieshi-Ogre-Jēkabpils-Daugavpils was completed. The construction of Dobele underground gas storage was also planned, but it was not realized. In 1987, the State Gasification Committee of the LPSR was reorganized into the production association Latvijas Gāze.
In 1991, after the restoration of Latvia's independence, the government took over the entire gas supply infrastructure on the territory of Latvia under its jurisdiction, merging them into the state company Latvijas Gāze (LG), which was registered on 25 March 1991, but on 31 January 1994 it was transformed into a state share society and in 1996 was included in the list of objects to be privatized. From 1997 to 2002, the privatization of Latvijas Gāze took place, and E.ON Ruhrgas International AG, AAS Gazprom and SIA ITERA Latvija became the shareholders of the company. In March 2014, E.ON Ruhrgas announced that it plans to leave the Latvian market. In 2016, E.ON Ruhrgas International GmbH was renamed Uniper Ruhrgas International GmbH, which on January 28 sold 28.97% of shares of Latvijas Gāze to the investment fund Marguerite Fund, in which the financial institutions Caisse des Depots et Consignations, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, European Investment participate bank, Instituto de Credito Oficial, KfW and PKO Bank Polski.
On 11 February 2016 the Saeima adopted amendments to the Energy Law, stipulating the right of users to choose a gas supplier, thereby implementing the final stage of the natural gas market reform, and by 3 April 2017 it was instructed to separate gas transmission and storage from distribution and trade. On 2 September 2016 the shareholders of Latvijas Gāze approved the reorganization of the company at an extraordinary meeting, on December 22 they established a new commercial company Conexus Baltic Grid and transferred the transmission and storage system assets to it. On 22 November 2017 Latvijas Gāze founded a subsidiary company Gaso, to which the functions of the distribution system operator were transferred.
Management.
The governing bodies of Latvijas Gāze are the shareholders' meeting, the council and the board, of which the shareholders' meeting is the highest. The council is the supervisory body of the company, which represents the interests of the shareholders and supervises the activities of the board between meetings of the shareholders. The council consists of 11 members who are elected for three years. In April 2014, the chairman of the council was Kirils Selezņovs, his deputies were Juris Savickis and Ahims Zauls.
The board manages and manages all affairs of the company, represents the company and manages the company's property in accordance with the Laws. The board decides all issues related to the company's activity, which are not within the competence of the council or the shareholders' meeting. The composition of the Company's Board consists of 5 members, who are elected by the council for three years. In April 2014, the chairman of the board was Adrians Dāvis, his deputies Mario Nulmeiers and Aleksandrs Mihejevs. In August 2015, Aigars Kalvītis, the former Prime Minister and President of Latvia, was appointed as the chairman of the board.
In 2022, one person worked on the board of JSC "Gaso", a subsidiary of JSC "Latvijas Gāze", while five Russian citizens worked on the board. On 16 June 2022 the Saeima adopted amendments to the National Security Law, which prohibited legal entities and citizens of Russia and Belarus from participating significantly in capital companies important to Latvia's security.
Support programs.
In 1997, Latvijas Gāze became a supporter of the Latvian Olympic Committee and the general sponsor of the Latvian National Men's Basketball Team. In 2003, it started funding an annual award for lifetime achievement in science, promising applications in the fields of gas, heating technology, related chemistry, and cardiology. In 2004, Latvijas Gāze was named a patron of the Latvian National Opera and also participated in organizing the International Opera Music Festival and supporting various international music festivals and competitions.

Goodeniaceae

Goodeniaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Asterales. It contains about 404 species in twelve genera. The family is distributed mostly in Australia, except for the genus "Scaevola", which is pantropical. Its species are found across most of Australia, being especially common in arid and semi-arid climates.
Morphology.
Species in Goodeniaceae are generally herbaceous with spiral leaves. Flowers have a single plane of symmetry (monosymmetric; "Brunonia" being the sole exception), and are either fan-like (e.g., "Scaevola") or bilabiate (as in "Dampiera"). Corolla lobes often have two thin marginal wings, which also occur in other families of Asterales such as the Menyanthaceae and Argophyllaceae. The style bears a pollen-cup, also known as an indusium, at the tip, a unique character for the family. The indusium has a function in secondary pollen presentation, a phenomenon also occurring in the related families Asteraceae and Campanulaceae. The ovary is inferior and the fruit is a drupe, a nut or a capsule. The seeds from capsular fruits usually have a mucilaginous wing.

Arazi (horse)

Arazi (March 4, 1989 – July 1, 2021) was an American-bred, French-trained Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 1991 Breeders' Cup Juvenile.
Background.
A chestnut colt with a crooked white blaze on his face (like his grandsire, Northern Dancer), at Arazi was a small horse by Thoroughbred standards. Bred by Ralph C. Wilson Jr., owner of the NFL Buffalo Bills, he was bought at the Keeneland Sales in Kentucky as a weanling for $350,000 by American businessman Allen E. Paulson. Chairman of Gulfstream Aerospace and a pilot, Paulson named the horse for the Arazi aeronautical navigational checkpoint in the Arizona desert. Paulson owned racing stables in the United States and Europe and he sent Arazi to France, where trainer François Boutin took charge of his conditioning.
Racing career.
1991: two-year-old season.
Ridden by jockey Gerald Mossé, in France, as a two-year-old Arazi won six of his first seven races, with an explosive come-from-behind style that was popular with spectators. In October, Paulson prepared to bring him to the United States for the 1991 Breeders' Cup. Prior to the race, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum made Paulson an offer of $9 million for a 50% share in Arazi.
Arazi competed in the 1991 Breeders' Cup Juvenile on November 2, 1991, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, ridden by American jockey Pat Valenzuela. Previously, seven European horses had won Breeders' Cup races, but all had been on grass; a number had failed to win a Breeders' Cup race on dirt. For Arazi, it was his first-ever race on dirt. The colt drew the outside post position, considered the least desirable spot in a field of 14 horses. Among the competitors in the Juvenile was the highly regarded California champion Bertrando, a future Eclipse Award winner, who came into the Breeders' Cup having won the Grade I Norfolk Stakes and the Del Mar Futurity.
Bertrando broke on an early lead and set a quick pace. By the time the field reached the far turn, Arazi was far back, more than a dozen lengths behind the front-running Bertrando. Suddenly, Arazi progressed through the field until he reached the third- and fourth-place horses. He moved between the two, swinging wide to pull up alongside Bertrando. at the top of the stretch, Arazi passed Bertrando and pulled away from the field. He was taken under a hard hold by his jockey and slowed as he crossed the finish line. As he did, NBC Sports race announcer Tom Durkin called, "Here indeed is a superstar!"
The win was the biggest winning margin in the history of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. In 2006, the win was described as possibly "the single-most spectacular performance in Breeders' Cup history." Durkin later noted that Arazi could have won by as much as ten lengths had he not been slowed by his jockey. Arazi's performance earned a Timeform rating of 135, in comparison with an average two-year-old rating of 110 to 120. For his 1991 season, Arazi earned the United States Eclipse Award for Outstanding Two-Year-Old Male Horse, the Cartier Champion Two-year-old Colt, and Cartier Horse of the Year.
While Arazi's victory made him an early favorite for the 1992 Kentucky Derby, shortly after the Breeders' Cup his racing future was placed in doubt when the colt underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove chip fractures from the top joint of both knees. The operation was controversial; press reports suggested that Boutin thought it was a mistake. The operation was successful, and the colt was sent to recuperate at his home base at Lamorlaye, about 35 km north of Paris. Arazi's recovery took longer than Boutin had hoped, but five months later, transplanted American jockey Steve Cauthen won easily with him in the Prix Omnium II, race on the grass at Hippodrome de Saint-Cloud.
1992: three-year-old season.
The pre-Kentucky Derby publicity for Arazi was compared to that of Silky Sullivan in 1958. Newspaper reporters and television crews met Arazi's plane at Louisville's Standiford Field. In interviews, jockey Steve Cauthen rated the colt in the same class as Affirmed, on whom he had won the U.S. Triple Crown in 1978. Jockey Patrick Valenzuela, who had ridden Arazi in his Breeders' Cup win and won the 1989 Derby aboard Sunday Silence said, "Arazi can do more [than Sunday Silence]." He added, "This race is over."
In the days leading up to the Kentucky Derby, press coverage of Arazi was extensive, and the racing world speculated as to whether the horse would remain in the United States in an attempt to win the Triple Crown or be shipped back to Europe to try to become the first Kentucky Derby champion to ever win England's Epsom Derby. "The New York Times" called the colt "mythical and almost mystical", and "Time" magazine stated, "Arazi is fast winning a reputation as the second coming of Secretariat". Joe Hirsch, with the "Daily Racing Form" said, "He [Arazi] is such an extraordinary animal that he makes other great horses look like hacks."
For the 118th running of the Kentucky Derby on May 2, 1992, Arazi drew post position 17 in a field of 18 horses. The outside post meant he would begin the race from an auxiliary starting gate. Despite this handicap, bettors wagered as much on Arazi to win as on the other 17 horses combined. Having raced only once in the previous seven months (apart from the Prix Omnium at St Cloud), from the start of the Derby the energetic colt had to be kept under wraps by his jockey. Near the back of the field for most of the race, after the quarter pole Arazi made a quick move. Running eight horses wide, and mirroring his dramatic performance in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, the colt flew past horse after horse with ABC television announcer Dave Johnson exclaiming, "Arazi is flying! - Arazi is gaining ground with every stride!" The colt moved into third place, tightly bunched with the leaders. But as they approached the homestretch, instead of pulling away as he had always done previously, Arazi tired and faded to finish eighth. Lil E. Tee, a little-known colt and an 18-1 longshot, won the race.
The racing world's consensus of Arazi's performance was that his knee surgery had affected his ability. Some blamed his poor showing on the fact that the colt had made only one prep start on soft grass before the Derby, while others} said he was a "miler" horse and the Derby's extra quarter-mile was too much for him. The upset spawned a book, "The Longest Shot: Lil E. Tee and the Kentucky Derby", by "Baltimore Sun" sportswriter and racing commentator John Eisenberg.
Returning to France, Arazi raced four more times, where future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Steve Cauthen rode him to victory in the Group II Prix du Rond Point and the Prix Omnium II.
His final race was a return to the United States, where fans made him the 3-2 favorite in the Breeders' Cup Mile at Gulfstream Park. He finished 11th.
Stud record.
Arazi was retired to Sheikh Mohammed's horse breeding operation at Dalham Hall Stud in Newmarket, England. Later, Sheik Mohammed purchased Allen Paulson's 50% share and then moved Arazi to Three Chimneys Farm in Kentucky, before he was sent to a breeder in Japan in 1997. He then went to the Independent Stallion Station in Victoria, Australia, in 2003. Arazi spent one season at Swiss breeding facility Gestut Sohrenhof, returning to Independent Stallion Station in 2006. He sired a gray colt named Karazi, who won three races in France before being shipped to Del Mar for the 2007 season.
Among Arazi's offspring are Congaree, who won the 2001 Wood Memorial Stakes, the 2002 and 2003 Cigar Mile Handicap, and the 2003 Hollywood Gold Cup and Carter Handicap. The greatest part of his reputation as a stud may be as a broodmare sire; offspring from his daughters include the ill-fated Electrocutionist, winner of the Dubai World Cup who died of a heart attack at 5 in 2006; Lahudood, winner of the 2007 Breeders' Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf and Eclipse Award champion turf filly; Bribon, winner of the Grade I Metropolitan Handicap in 2009; and Americain, winner of the Melbourne Cup in 2010.
In September 2017 Arazi, aged 28, was reported to be enjoying his retirement at Stockwell Stud, Victoria, alongside Brief Truce, who beat him in the 1992 St James's Palace Stakes.
On July 1, 2021, it was announced that Arazi, aged 32, had died from age-related complications.

Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts

Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts, formerly Mountview Theatre School, is a drama school in Peckham, south London, England, founded in 1945. Mountview Academy provides specialist vocational training in acting, musical theatre and actor musicianship, as well as production arts and theatre creative practices. The President of the school is Dame Judi Dench, and the Principal is Sally Ann Gritton.
History.
Mountview was founded in Crouch End, north London, in 1945 by Peter Coxhead and Ralph Nossek as "The Mountview Theatre Club", an amateur repertory company staging a new production for a six-day run every second week. Among the club's productions were Coxhead's staging of Eugene O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra", a production of the complete Arnold Wesker Trilogy – "Chicken Soup with Barley", "Roots" and "I'm Talking about Jerusalem" directed by Peter Scott-Smith – and "Buttered Both Sides", a revue written and composed by Mountview member Ted Dicks and directed by Gale Webb, which later transferred to the Fortune Theatre in London's West End.
Early in 1946, when 21 years old, Coxhead borrowed £2,300 to buy the lease of Cecile House, a large derelict property at Crouch End. Development at Cecile House included the conversion of a gymnasium into what became the Mountview Theatre.
The Mountview Theatre officially opened in November 1947 with a production of "The Importance of Being Earnest". The theatre presented one play each month until 1949, after-which Coxhead bought the building outright from the leaseholders. For the next 25 years the theatre staged a new production every two to three weeks. Ralph Nossek went on to pursue a professional acting career in 1955 that lasted 56 years.
Acting courses and technical theatre skills training were introduced part-time from 1958 when Mountview Theatre School was formally recognised in name. Its first president was George Norman, with Coxhead as its principal. This remained the case for the next ten years.
In 1969 the school began full-time drama courses. In 1971 a second performance space was built and opened as the Judi Dench Theatre. There were also 10 working studios for acting students, three for technical students and a wardrobe with more than 15,000 costumes. By 1985 the school had leased additional premises at Wood Green, that were named the Sir Ralph Richardson Memorial Studios.
Coxhead retired as principal in 1996; he was replaced by Paul Clements, former director of drama at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. Coxhead became chairman and chief executive of the school board until 2000, when Mountview Theatre School changed its name to the Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts, In 2001, Coxhead was appointed an MBE for Services to the Arts. He died in 2004, after 59 years involvement with the school.
Paul Clements remained as principal until 2008, when he was replaced by Sue Robertson, previously dean of the School of Arts at City University London, who was subsequently replaced by Stephen Jameson in 2014. Jameson was previously associate director at LAMDA.
In 2007, the British reality television show "E4 School of Performing Arts" offered several would-be actors the chance to win scholarships to Mountview, Italia Conti and the Academy of Contemporary Music. Mountview's Director of Acting Programme, Amir M. Korangy, appeared on the show as part of the panel.
In 2011, Mountview principal Robertson announced plans to relocate to part of Hornsey Town Hall in Crouch End, a stone's throw from Crouch Hill where it was founded, opening there for the 2014–15 academic year. A multi-use regeneration was planned for the Grade II-listed Town Hall and the site to its rear, a £19 million project. Haringey Council's cabinet approved the plan on 26 April 2011 on the basis of a business case that included Mountview. The plan fell through when Mountview withdrew, and in 2016 Mountview received planning permission for a new site in Peckham, south-east London. The new building opened in September 2018.

Michael Richard (photographer)

Michael Richard (1948 – August 28, 2006) was an American professional rock musician and amateur photographer. In 2002, surgery to remove a malignant tumor behind his right eye left him legally blind, and he began taking abstract photos of urban scenes. Those images have been exhibited at galleries in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Music career.
Richard was born in Brooklyn, New York and studied music at City College of New York. After graduation, he moved to California.
He played guitar for advertising jingles and television show soundtracks. He also played backup guitar for Little Richard and The Coasters.
Photography.
Following surgery to remove the tumor behind his eye, Richard could see only gauzy shapes. In a 2003 interview, he said they were "like the most extreme soft-focus photos you can imagine."
Richard had been an amateur photographer prior to the surgery but expected to have to give up that hobby after losing most of his vision. While learning to use a cane at the Braille Institute of Los Angeles, Richard heard about a photography class at the institute. The class, taught by a professional magazine photographer, offered the visually impaired tips on the model of camera to use and suggestions on film developing.
Richard obtained a manual camera and used a magnifying glass to adjust the settings. His wife, Patrice Hughes, drove him to locations around Los Angeles. Richard used black-and-white film to transform buildings and street vistas into abstract forms.
Richard developed the prints himself and began exhibiting the photos at optometry schools, centers for the blind, and art museums.
His work was included in "Blind at the Museum," a show about blindness and the visual arts, in 2005 at Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.
Richard's photos have also been shown at the Los Angeles gallery LA Artcore and at two major art fairs, Photo LA and Photo San Francisco.

Rake (cellular automaton)

A rake, in the lexicon of cellular automata, is a type of "puffer train", which is an automaton that leaves behind a trail of debris. In the case of a rake, however, the debris left behind is a stream of spaceships, which are automata that "travel" by looping through a short series of iterations and end up in a new location after each cycle returns to the original configuration.
In Conway's Game of Life, the discovery of rakes was one of the key components needed to form the "breeder", the first known pattern in Life in which the number of live cells exhibits quadratic growth. A breeder is formed by arranging several rakes so that the "gliders"—the smallest possible spaceships—they generate interact to form a sequence of "glider guns", patterns which emit gliders. The emitted gliders fill a growing triangle of the plane of the game. More generally, when a rake exists for a cellular automaton rule (a mathematical function defining the next iteration to be derived from a particular configuration of live and dead cells), one can often construct puffers which leave trails of many other kinds of objects, by colliding the streams of spaceships emitted by multiple rakes moving in parallel. As David Bell writes:
The first rake to be discovered, in the early 1970s, was the "space rake", which moves with speed "c"/2 (or one unit every two steps), emitting a glider every twenty steps. For Life, rakes are now known that move orthogonally with speeds "c"/2, "c"/3, "c"/4, "c"/5, 2"c"/5, 2"c"/7, "c"/10 and 17"c"/45, and diagonally with speeds "c"/4 and "c"/12, with many different periods. Rakes are also known for some other cellular automata, including Highlife, Day &amp; Night, and Seeds.
Gotts (1980) shows that the space rake in Life can be formed by a "standard collision sequence" in which a single glider interacts with a widely separated set of 3-cell initial seeds ("blinkers" and "blocks"). As a consequence, he finds lower bounds on the probability that these patterns form in any sufficiently sparse and sufficiently large random initial condition for Life. This result leads to standard collision sequences for many other patterns such as breeders.

Raffaele Giammaria (born 1 September 1977 in Civitavecchia) is an Italian racing car driver.
He was runner-up in the Formula Renault 2000 Italy series in 2000, then progressed through German and Italian Formula Three and Italian Formula 3000 to International Formula 3000 for 2003 with the Durango team. He scored one podium and was placed tenth in the championship with 12 points, a respectable score in his début season.
2004 was even better for Giammaria, with 27 points scored and eighth place in the championship secured by the season's end. However, he missed one of the races due to financial problems, and was forced to switch teams, from Durango to Astromega.
It was therefore not much of a surprise when he failed to get a drive in the rebranded GP2 Series for 2005. He competed in Formula Renault 3.5 Series and Italian F3000 instead, but only in part-time roles. He was also part of A1 Team Italy for the inaugural season of the A1 Grand Prix series, but never drove the car.
He competed in Italian GT racing for 2006.

David Lennox

David Lennox (1788 – 12 November 1873) was a Scottish-Australian bridge builder and master stonemason born in Ayr, Scotland.
Personal details.
Trained as a stonemason, Lennox worked on Telford's Menai Suspension Bridge at Anglesey in Wales and on Over Bridge at Gloucester before emigrating to Australia following the death of his wife. He arrived in August 1832 aboard the ship Florentia.
Prior to this time, the young colony of New South Wales had no skilled stonemasons, and so it was almost fate that a chance meeting with the Surveyor-General, Major Thomas Mitchell should result in Lennox—by now a Master Stonemason with twenty years' experience—becoming, provisionally, Sub-Inspector of Bridges and later Superintendent of Bridges.
Lennox moved to Melbourne in 1844, to take up a position responsible for bridges in the Port Phillip district.
Lennox retired in November 1853 and returned to New South Wales two years later where he lived in Parramatta. He died on 12 November 1873, and was buried in old St John's cemetery, Parramatta. His grave was never marked so it is not known exactly where he was interred.
Partial list of works.
As well as bridges, Lennox was also in charge of roads, wharves and ferries in the Port Phillip district.

Julie Fowlis

Julie Fowlis (born 20 June 1979) is a Scottish folk singer and multi-instrumentalist who sings primarily in Scottish Gaelic.
Early life.
Fowlis was born and grew up on North Uist, an island in the Outer Hebrides, in a Gaelic-speaking community. Her mother was a Gaelic-speaking islander from a family of fishermen and crofters which originated on the island of Heisgeir, while her father was originally from Pitlochry on mainland Scotland. Her parents ran a hotel for many years on North Uist. She moved with her parents to Ross-shire on the mainland when she was 15 years old after her father took a new job. The family lived in Strathpeffer and Fowlis finished her secondary education at Dingwall Academy. She attended the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow and studied the oboe and the English horn. She graduated in 2000 with a BA in Applied Music. After university, Fowlis attended the Gaelic language college Sabhal Mòr Ostaig on the Isle of Skye to improve her Gaelic and formally study traditional Scottish music. After completing her studies on Skye she returned to Ross-shire. From 2001-2004, she was music development officer at the Gaelic language and culture organisation Fèis Rois in Dingwall.
Career.
Fowlis had been involved in singing, piping and dancing since she was a child. She began her professional music career as a member of the Scottish sextet Dòchas which included Shetland fiddle player Jenna Reid. The group formed while four of its members were students at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and Fowlis was a student at nearby University of Strathclyde. Billed as "a young and dynamic all-female band playing traditional music from the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and Ireland," the band released its first album in 2002. The group was nominated for the "Best Up and Coming Artist/Band" award at the inaugural Scots Trad Music Awards in 2003 and won the award in 2004. Fowlis herself was nominated for the "Gaelic Singer of the Year" award the same year.
While continuing with Dòchas and releasing the band's second album "An Darna Umhail" in 2005, Fowlis began to strike out on her own. Also in 2005 she released her first solo album "Mar a Tha Mo Chridhe" ("As My Heart Is"). The album was produced by Iain MacDonald and Fowlis and instantly gained her worldwide acclaim. Fowlis' future husband Éamonn Doorley played bouzouki on seven of the tracks. She was also accompanied by Kris Drever, Ross Martin of the Gaelic super group" Dàimh, John Doyle, Iain MacDonald, Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh of Danú, and many other performers prominent in the traditional Irish and Scottish music scenes. The album was remastered and re-released in 2012.
Her second solo album "Cuilidh" was released in March 2007, becoming a worldwide top-seller in the Traditional and World Music charts. Her album is a collection of songs from her native North Uist. Doorley again played bouzouki on nearly all the tracks and co-produced the album with Fowlis. She is also accompanied by John Doyle, Ross Martin, John McCusker, Iain MacDonald, Kathleen MacInnes, and many others.
Fowlis won the "Horizon" award at the 2006 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, won "Folk Singer of The Year" at the 2008 awards and was nominated for the "Folk Singer of the Year" award at the 2007 awards. She appeared on "Later With Jools Holland" on BBC Two on 25 May 2007, and performed "Hùg air Bhonaid Mhòir" on the show. Notable fans of Fowlis include Björk, Ricky Gervais and Radiohead's Phil Selway.
In 2008, Fowlis recorded an album with long-time friends and collaborators Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh, Ross Martin and husband Éamonn Doorley. The album, entitled "Dual", was released in October 2008. Fowlis toured extensively around Scotland, Ireland, central Europe and America and launched both her solo albums while on tour. Fowlis recorded a Scottish Gaelic cover of The Beatles' song Blackbird for "Mojo" magazine to celebrate the 40th anniversary of The Beatles' "The White Album". The song was released as a download single from Fowlis' website in October 2008.
On 24 April 2009, Fowlis announced that she would begin recording her third studio album in May and that she would preview tracks from the project on her May 2009 tour of England. On 10 August 2009, she announced the album's title, "Uam" (Scottish Gaelic for 'From Me'). The album was released 26 October.
In September 2011, she performed the hour-long "Heisgeir" at the Phipps Hall in Beauly. The piece, "half-documentary, half-arthouse meditation", celebrated "the history, landscape and legend" of the now-uninhabited Heisgeir, as part of the six "Blas 2011" concert series.
In 2012, Fowlis contributed to the Pixar film "Brave" with the songs "Touch the Sky" and "Into the Open Air", sung in the off-screen musical thoughts of the lead character Merida.

All of Fowlis' albums including "Dual" have been released on the Machair Records. The label, which is operated by Fowlis and her husband Éamon Doorley, is an outlet for their music. Machair "is a Gaelic word which describes rich and fertile low-lying land. Almost half of all Scottish machair occurs in the Outer Hebrides and it is one of the rarest habitat types in Europe. It is a fragile environment which is under threat, a little like the music which is produced on this label." Their label distributes through Cadiz Music.
Broadcasting career.
Fowlis has a notable broadcasting career complementing her musical accomplishments. She appeared as a guest on BBC Radio Scotland's flagship traditional music programme Travelling Folk and the world music show Global Gathering.

In 2012, a short documentary on Fowlis, her family, and her band broadcast on the United States television channel PBS as part of an episode of the program "Sound Tracks: Music Without Borders".
In 2015, Fowlis and her frequent musical collaborator Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh hosted a television series "Port" dedicated to traditional Scottish and Irish music. In each episode, Fowlis and Nic Amhlaoibh travel to a new location highlighting local folk musicians and the local traditional music scene. The programme is narrated by Fowlis in Scottish Gaelic and Nic Amhlaoibh in Irish, with English-language subtitles. It is broadcast on both BBC Alba and TG4. The first season ran seven episodes, and a second season of seven episodes in 2016.

Reflector (cellular automaton)

In cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, a reflector is a pattern that can interact with a spaceship to change its direction of motion, without damage to the reflector pattern. In Life, many oscillators can reflect the glider; there also exist stable reflectors composed of still life patterns that, when they interact with a glider, reflect the glider and return to their stable state.
Types.
As well as whether a reflector is a still life or an oscillator, a reflector might be characterised by the angle between the input and output spaceships (for example a 180° reflector would flip a spaceship). For most spaceships, this can only be 0°, 90°, or 180°. Another property is whether the reflector is colour preserving. That is, if it doesn't change the state of a spaceship as it gets reflected. If a reflector isn't colour preserving, it's known as colour changing.

1951 NFL Championship Game

The 1951 NFL Championship Game was the National Football League's 19th championship game, played December 23 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California.
It was a rematch of the previous year's game in Cleveland, with the Los Angeles Rams (8–4) of the National Conference meeting the defending league champion Cleveland Browns (11–1) of the American Conference. In the league championship game for the third straight year, the Rams were seeking their first NFL title since moving to California in early 1946 (the Cleveland Rams won the 1945 title, then left a month later). The Browns were favored to win this title game on the road by six points.
This was the first NFL championship game to be televised coast-to-coast, and was blacked out by the league in the southern California area. The DuMont Network purchased the championship game TV rights from the NFL in May for five years (1951–55) for $475,000.
The home underdog Rams upset the Browns 24–17 for their second NFL championship before a then-record crowd for the title game of 59,475. The "World Championship" banner awarded to the Rams was given as a gift to Tom Bergin after the game in gratitude for hosting the post-game dinner. As of 2016 it still hangs in the Tom Bergin's Irish pub in Los Angeles, the only one in private ownership. This was also the first time that the Browns under Paul Brown did not finish the season with a championship after 4 wins in the AAFC and a championship in their first NFL season in 1950.
This was the Rams' only NFL championship as a California team until their victory in Super Bowl LVI against the Cincinnati Bengals, which is coincidentally the team founded by Brown. The Rams won their first NFL championship during their final season in Cleveland, and also won Super Bowl XXXIV during their fifth season in St. Louis.
Game summary.
After a missed field-goal attempt by Cleveland on its opening drive, the Rams were the first to score, with a 1-yard run by fullback Dick Hoerner in the second quarter. The Browns answered back with an NFL Championship record 52-yard field goal by Lou Groza, following the first of two interceptions by Rams QB Bob Waterfield, who would later be replaced by Norm van Brocklin. The Browns later took the lead with a 17-yard touchdown pass from Otto Graham to Dub Jones, which accounted for the halftime score of 10–7.
In the third quarter, Ram Larry Brink landed a hard tackle on Graham, causing him to fumble the ball, which Andy Robustelli picked up on the Cleveland 24 and returned it to the two-yard-line. On third down from the one, "Deacon" Dan Towler ran the ball in for a touchdown to give the Rams a 14–10 lead.
After Graham threw an interception in two of the Browns' next three possessions, the Rams increased their lead with a 17-yard field goal by former local UCLA great Bob Waterfield early in the fourth quarter. The Browns answered back with an 8-play, 70-yard drive that ended with a 5-yard touchdown run by Ken Carpenter to tie the game at 17–17. 
Twenty-five seconds later, Tom Fears beat defenders Cliff Lewis and Tommy James, and received a Norm Van Brocklin pass at midfield and raced to the end zone for a 73-yard touchdown. Van Brocklin had entered the game at quarterback for Bob Waterfield, whose two first-half interceptions accounted for two of the Rams' three turnovers.
The go-ahead touchdown from Van Brocklin to Fears was followed by Graham's third interception of the game and two more empty possessions by the Browns and thus secured the Rams' first NFL title in Los Angeles. Their second title in Los Angeles came in February 2022.
The next NFL title for the franchise came 48 years later, when the St. Louis Rams won Super Bowl XXXIV in January 2000.

Wizards in Winter

"Wizards in Winter" is an instrumental track by Trans-Siberian Orchestra, released on the 2004 album "The Lost Christmas Eve". A clip of the band playing the first few seconds of the piece was used in a commercial for its most recent concert tour, and the song is often used to open their live shows. Its musical style incorporates progressive rock, symphonic metal, and heavy metal, with influences from classical music.
Christmas lights phenomenon.
During the 2004 Christmas season, electrical engineer Carson Williams set up a Christmas light show in the front yard, driveway, windows, and roof of his house. It took him about two months and 16,000 lights. The lights were synchronized to the music, and the show was free for anyone passing by who tuned to a specific low-power FM frequency on their car radio. It is also available to download on iTunes as a music video. A still image of the light show serves as the cover art for the single.
A three-minute video of the show playing circulated widely on the Internet, and also spawned many others who imitated the style of setting their Christmas lights to this and other songs. It was later adapted by Miller Brewing Company into a 30-second TV advertisement for Miller Lite that aired on U.S. stations in late 2005.
A similar animation was used in a commercial for the UK's National Lottery, although, according to a press release, the advertising campaign "was created by Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO". No mention of Carson Williams' light show was made.
The advertisement can be seen on the "tellyads.com" website.
The piece is also used in Jordan's Furniture's 2009 Christmas LITE (Laser Imagination Theater Experience) show. Tesla Motors have also used it in December 2015 in the Merry Model X-Mas teaser video for the Tesla Model X, and in December 2016 activated the show in all customer cars. Disney used the piece for a segment of "World of Color: Season of Light", featuring Goofy putting up his Christmas lights to the track.

3 ÖVP, 2 Freie Unabhängige Liste - Lebenswert, 1 FPÖ.
Twin towns and sister cities.
Thörl is twinned with:
Traffic.
Streets.
The Mariazeller Straße is the most important road link between Kapfenberg and Mariazell, the most popular pilgrimage site in Austria. In its further course it leads to Sankt Pölten, the capital of the neighbouring state of Lower Austria.
Railway (History).
In 1893, the Thörlerbahn, a narrow gauge railway with a track gauge of 760 mm, which linked the area with Kapfenberg and the Austrian Southern Railway (Südbahn), was opened. In particular, the local iron industry benefited from this. A connection to the Austrian Western Railway was planned, but never realized.
In 1959, the passenger traffic was terminated. However, in 1991, the "Verein Thörlerbahn" ("Thörlerbahn Association") took out a trial run with a nostalgic train. But when a bank failure bankrupted the local iron industry, the operator of the railway, Steiermärkische Landesbahnen, lost their largest (and actually the only) freight customer. As a consequence of that, they had to close the track.
In 2003 and 2004, the train tracks were removed and replaced by a cycle track.

Heorogar was a legendary Danish king who appears in the Old English poem "Beowulf" as the eldest son of Healfdene (Halfdan), and the brother of Hroðgar (Hroar), and Halga (Helgi). The people in parentheses are personages found also in Norse sources.
He is mentioned in lines 2155-2165 of the poem, when King Hrothgar gives Beowulf the armour and weapons that originally belonged to King Heorogar:
Translation:
Unlike Halga, Hroðgar, Healfdene, and Heorogar's son Heoroweard, Heorogar does not appear in Norse sources. However, Heorogar may explain why Heoroweard (according to Norse sources) rebelled against Hroðulf (Hrólf Kraki) and killed him. As the son of Heorogar, the eldest of Healfdene's sons, Heoroweard had greater right to the Danish throne than Hroðulf.

Wilston State School opened on 16 August 1920 on the site of the former Coronation Park.
After seven years of agitation, Brisbane's tram service was extended to Grange in July 1928. The opening ceremony was attended by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, William Jolly, and two Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, James Stevingstone Kerr and Charles Taylor. The mayor had threatened not to attend any ceremony for the opening of the tram service because two rival groups were organising separate celebrations; he would only attend if there was a single ceremony.
Grange Heights Methodist Church opened on Saturday 23 February 1946 at 26 Progress Road (), now in Alderley. It became Grange Heights Uniting Church. It closed between 1975 and 1990. The building still exists and is used as a childcare centre.
St Paul the Apostle's Anglican Church at Grange Heights (the elevated western part of the suburb) was dedicated on 4 April 1964 by Archbishop Philip Strong. It was at 17 Blandford Street (). It closed on 29 November 1989. It is now called Blandford Place and used as commercial premises.

Samuel Laing (science writer)

Samuel Laing (12 December 1812 – 6 August 1897) was a British railway administrator, politician, and writer on science and religion during the Victorian era.
Early life.
Samuel Laing was born on 12 December 1812 in Edinburgh. His father, also called Samuel Laing (1780–1868), was a well-known author, whose books on Norway and Sweden attracted much attention. Laing the Younger's uncle was historian Malcolm Laing. Laing the Younger entered St John's College, Cambridge in 1827, and after graduating as Second Wrangler and Smith's Prizeman, was elected a fellow. He remained at Cambridge temporarily as a mathematics coach, before being called to the bar in 1837.
Career.
He became private secretary to Henry Labouchere, later 1st Baron Taunton, who was then the President of the Board of Trade. In 1842, he was made secretary to the railway department, and retained this post until 1847. He had by then become an authority on railways, and had been a member of the Dalhousie Railway Commission; it was at his suggestion that the "parliamentary" rate of a penny a mile was instituted. In 1848, he was appointed chairman and managing director of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR), and his business acumen showed itself in the largely increased prosperity of the line. He also became chairman (1852) of The Crystal Palace Company, but retired from both posts in 1855.
In 1852, he was elected to Parliament as a Liberal Party candidate in Wick Burghs. After losing his seat in 1857, he was re-elected in 1859, and appointed Financial Secretary to the Treasury; in 1860 he was made finance minister in India. On returning from India, he was re-elected to parliament for Wick in 1865. He was defeated in 1868, but in 1873 he was returned for Orkney and Shetland, and retained his seat until 1885. Early in 1867 he was elected to the board of the Great Eastern Railway who by that point were sliding towards receivership. On 1 July, the day before the GER went into receivership, he was reappointed chairman of the Brighton line, which was now on the point of bankruptcy following the over-ambitious expansion plans of the previous chairman. He continued in that post until 1896, and gradually restored the company to financial health. He was also chairman of the Railway Debenture Trust and the Railway Share Trust.
Science writer.
In later life, he became well known as an author, his "Modern Science and Modern Thought" (1885), "Problems of the Future" (1889) and "Human Origins" (1892) being widely read, not only by reason of the writer's influential position, experience of affairs and clear style, but also through their popular and at the same time well-informed treatment of the scientific problems of the day. Laing's attitude was generally positive towards new developments in science, and he offered an optimistic vision of progressive modernity. He also wrote on religion. His book "A Modern Zoroastrian" argued that the ancient religion of Zoroastrianism was more consistent with modern scientific thought than was traditional Christianity. He argued that the "all pervading principle of polarity" that was central Zoroastrian thought has been confirmed by science, and that modern Christianity should abandon its traditional theology to centre on the figure of Jesus as an ideal of humanity.
Personal life.
Laing married Mary Dickson ( Cowan) (1819–1902). Together, they were the parents of eleven children:
Laing was often claimed to have been the father of the novelist Mary Eliza Kennard (1850–1936). This issue is still in dispute. However birth entries at the General Register Office for her sons Lionel Edward Kennard and Malcolm Alfred Kennard both have Laing as the mother's maiden name. Furthermore, the transcribed parish record entry for her marriage to Edward Kennard on 19 April 1870 at Saint Nicholas church, Brighton gives her name as Mary Eliza Laing, daughter of Samuel Laing.
Laing died on 6 August 1897 at his home in Sydenham, England and was buried in the Brighton Extramural Cemetery.

Castle Coeffin

Castle Coeffin is a ruin on the island of Lismore, an island in Loch Linnhe, in Argyll, on the west coast of Scotland. It stands on a promontory on the north-west coast of the island, across Loch Linnhe from Glensanda, at .
History.
Coeffin Castle was built on the site of a Viking fortress. The name "Coeffin" is thought to come from "Caifen" who was a Danish prince, and whose sister supposedly haunted the castle until her remains were taken back to be buried beside her lover in Norway.
Coeffin Castle was built in the 13th century, probably by the MacDougalls of Lorn. Lismore was an important site within their lordship, being the location of St. Moluag's Cathedral, seat of the Bishop of Argyll. The first written evidence of the castle occurs in 1469–70, when it was granted to Sir Colin Campbell of Glenorchy by Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll. It is unlikely to have been occupied in post-mediaeval times.
The ruins.
The ruins comprise an oblong hall-house and an irregularly shaped bailey. The great hall is an irregular rectangle, measuring The walls are from thick. The bailey was mostly built at a later date than the hall. An external stair probably linked the entrance, in the north-east wall, to the bailey. A second door gave access to the sea to the south-west.
Other features.
A tidal fish trap, of unknown age, is located in the small bay to the south-east of the castle. To the north-east of the castle are the remains of a stone-walled fort. The "Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland", published in 1892, lists a Castle Rachal in the same general location as Castle Coeffin. It is described as "a very ancient Scandinavian fortalice in Lismore and Appin parish, Argyllshire, on the NW side of Lismore island, from the north-eastern extremity, now a dilapidated ivy-clad ruin."

Samuel Laing (travel writer)

Samuel Laing (1780–1868) from Papdale in Orkney was a Scottish travel writer. He travelled in Scandinavia and northern Germany and published descriptions of these countries. Laing was the first translator of Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson.
He unsuccessfully contested the Orkney and Shetland parliamentary constituency in 1832 against incumbent MP George Traill. Held after the passage of the Great Reform Act, this was the first election in which Shetlanders had the right to vote. Laing had won an early majority of votes counted in Orkney and was initially celebrated as the victor, however the delayed arrival of votes from Shetland produced a majority of 11 for Traill. The loss of Laing's majority provoked a riot in Kirkwall, leading to one fatality. Laing's subsequent attempt to lodge a legal challenge to his defeat was also unsuccessful.
Laing's son, also named Samuel Laing, was a railway administrator and important writer on religion and science, and a Liberal member of parliament. Laing's older brother, Malcolm Laing, was a notable historian. The merchant Gilbert Laing Meason was his older brother as well.

Sidney Brownsberger

Sidney Brownsberger (born September 20, 1845, Perrysburg, Ohio; died August 13, 1930, Fletcher, North Carolina) was an American Seventh-day Adventist educator and administrator. He helped to develop Battle Creek College (now Andrews University) and later Healdsburg College (now Pacific Union College).
Early years.
Sidney Brownsberger was the youngest of eight children born to the family of John and Barbara Brownsberger. Twelve years before Sidney was born, the family moved from southern Pennsylvania to Perrysburg, Ohio.
In 1865, he completed preparatory studies at Baldwin University. In 1869, he enrolled in the University of Michigan to pursue a classical degree. graduating with an A.B.
 At the University of Michigan, Brownsberger served on the academic senate.
While a student at Ann Arbor, he first heard of Seventh-day Adventists. He sent for all the literature printed by the church at the time. As a student he spent much of his spare time studying the Bible and the Adventist books he had acquired. Agreeing with what he read, without ever having seen a Seventh-day Adventist, he began keeping the Sabbath alone during his junior year in college in 1868.
Brownsberger's early commitment to his newfound faith faltered. Looking back at those early years of struggling faith, he described the Holy Spirit striving with him telling him to stop trifling and be a man. After his graduation he became superintendent of schools in Maumee, Ohio, and then superintendent of schools in Delta, Ohio. It was here that he resumed his observance of the Sabbath. The following year (1873), Adventist church leaders invited him to head the fledgling school that had been established in Battle Creek, Michigan.
Battle Creek College.
Adventist interest in education began in the 1850s. James White wrote out reasons for the development of Church schools in the Review and Herald. The first school on record is one started at Buck's Bridge. Goodloe Bell began a school at Battle Creek with the Kellogg and White children. When plans developed for a formal College, the organizers turned to Brownsberger. Goodloe Bell did not have the decree standing of Brownsberger.
In 1872, Ellen White had published her views on "Proper Education". She presented these to the board of the new school. Afterwards, people turned to Brownsberger for his reaction. He said he knew nothing about managing such a school; manual labor combined with education based on the Bible.
The board decided to start an ordinary school rather than one meeting Ellen White's recommendation.
Brownsberger would later observe that Ellen White's educational principles were so far advanced that no one understood how to implement them.
Disrupted marital life.
While at Healdsburg College, Brownsberger's marriage broke down. His wife divorced him; he didn't contest the divorce. Sometime later he married his secretary. Willie White, Ellen G. White's son and assistant, commented about the difficult relationship Brownsberger had with his first wife. While in Australia, Ellen White wrote a letter to Haskell discussing Brownsberger's situation. She reported that he had confessed his wrong and that she believed that God had forgiven him. However, she expressed concern that his record would follow him. Otherwise, she would have invited him to come to Australia and work for the church there.

Lil E. Tee

Lil E. Tee (March 29, 1989 – March 18, 2009) was an American-bred Thoroughbred racehorse who in 1992 scored one of the biggest upsets in the history of the Kentucky Derby.
Background.
A bay colt, Lil E. Tee was bred in Pennsylvania by Lawrence I. Littman.
The name of the colt was explained by Gwen Rynkiewicz, assistant trainer at Laurel Race Course: All of Littman's horses have "Lil," the initials of Lawrence I. Littman, somewhere in their names. Rynkiewicz said she was told "that Lil E. Tee was so ugly and gangly when he was a foal that they named him after E.T., the extraterrestrial creature in the Steven Spielberg movie."
Many sportswriters have described his pedigree as being unimpressive. Although his sire, At the Threshold, was a multiple Grade I stakes winner, he produced only eight stakes winners during his stud career. Lil E. Tee's dam, Eileen's Moment, never won a race and had career earnings of $570. However, At the Threshold was sired by Norcliffe, who was a son of U.S. Hall of Fame Champion Buckpasser. Norcliffe earned Horse of the Year honours in Canada and was elected to the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. At stud, he was North America's leading juvenile sire by number of wins and was second in earnings in 1981.
As a weanling, Lil E. Tee nearly died but was saved by emergency stomach surgery. Considered to have little racing potential, he was sold for $2,000 as a yearling. When he was two, his owner tried to sell him again but was rejected by an auction company that deemed the horse unsaleable. Lil E. Tee ended up in the hands of a Florida owner and was stabled at Calder Race Course in Miami, Florida.
Racing career.
Florida: Two-year-old season.
In Florida, Lil E. Tee finished second in his first start and then won a 7-furlong maiden race. He was sold again, this time to W. Cal Partee, who shipped him to trainer Lynn S. Whiting at Churchill Downs, where Lil E. Tee won a one-mile allowance race. Of his four starts at age two, the horse won twice and finished second twice.
Arkansas: Prep races.
Racing in Arkansas, at age three Lil E. Tee won the Grade II Jim Beam Stakes and finished second by a neck to Pine Bluff in the Arkansas Derby, results that led to his appearance in the 1992 Kentucky Derby.
Kentucky Derby: The build-up.
Lil E. Tee was ridden by jockey Pat Day, who hadn't won a Derby in nine previous attempts. On a track rated as fast, the horse went off at odds of 17–1 in front of a record crowd that had come to see European Horse of the Year Arazi. The press had talked about little except Arazi since his dominating win in the previous October's Breeders' Cup Juvenile. The New York Times called him ""mythical and almost mystical" and TIME magazine said, "Arazi is fast winning a reputation as the second coming of Secretariat"." Joe Hirsch, a respected columnist with the New Jersey–based Daily Racing Form, wrote that Arazi was ""such an extraordinary animal that he makes other great horses look like hacks". Arazi's jockey, Patrick Valenzuela, who had won the 1989 Derby aboard Sunday Silence, assured reporters that "This race is over"." Fifteen years after his Breeders' Cup win, a National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) 2006 article said that "Arazi turned in what many still consider to be the single-most spectacular performance in Breeders' Cup history."
Kentucky Derby: The race.
Starting in post position #10, Lil E. Tee got off to a clean start in the 1992 Kentucky Derby and was in tenth place after half a mile. Arazi, who had started on the far outside in post position #17, made an explosive move. ABC television announcer Dave Johnson exclaimed "Arazi is flying" as the colt went seven wide, sweeping past horse after horse to move into third place, tightly bunched with the leaders. Lil E. Tee followed Arazi, moving into 5th place. As they approached the home stretch, though, Arazi tired badly. Lil E. Tee made his move and soon caught the front-running Casual Lies to win the most prestigious race in America and $724,800.
Later career.
After the Derby, Lil E. Tee was entered in the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the American Triple Crown races. He finished 5th, five lengths behind winner Pine Bluff. Lil E. Tee then skipped the Belmont Stakes after being diagnosed with a lung infection. On June 9, the colt's racing season ended when he underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips from his front ankles. Recovered, in 1993 at age 4, Lil E. Tee won the Grade II Razorback Handicap. He also finished second in the Oaklawn Handicap. He was retired that year with a lifetime record of 7-4-1 from 13 starts and earnings of $1,437,506.
Stud career.
Lil E. Tee stood at stud at Old Frankfort Stud near Lexington, Kentucky, until he was euthanized on March 18, 2009. Farm owner Jim Plemmons said the horse fell ill the month prior following an operation to repair an obstructed bowel.
Lil E. Tee sired 20 stakes winners in total, with progeny earnings reaching $9.9 million. His best runners include multiple graded stakes winner Mula Gula and graded winner Jim'smrtee.
Mula Gula currently stands stallion duties at Midas Hill Farm in Texas.

Hurricane Dennis (1981)

Hurricane Dennis caused severe flooding in Miami-Dade County, Florida, in August 1981. The tenth tropical cyclone and fourth named storm of the season, Dennis developed from a tropical wave well south of Cabo Verde on August 7. The depression intensified into a tropical storm early the next day. Dennis then encountered strong wind shear, causing the storm to weaken to a tropical depression on August 11. After crossing the Windward Islands on August 12, Dennis degenerated into a tropical wave several hours later over the Caribbean Sea. The wave became a tropical depression again late on August 15 while approaching Cuba. Dennis reintensified into a tropical storm before landfall in Matanzas Province. The cyclone emerged into the Straits of Florida on August 16, before striking the Florida Keys and then mainland Monroe County early the next day. It drifted across Florida, reaching the Atlantic near Cape Canaveral on August 19. Dennis continued to intensify and made landfall near Emerald Isle, North Carolina, but moved east-northeastward and soon tracked offshore. Late on August 20, Dennis deepened into a hurricane with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), before weakening to a tropical storm over colder waters on August 21. Dennis became extratropical northeast of Bermuda early on August 22 and persisted until being absorbed by a frontal system on August 26.
In the Caribbean, Dennis dropped heavy rainfall on some islands, including Martinique, Saint Lucia, Virgin Islands, and the Greater Antilles. Flooding in Jamaica left at least 50 people homeless. In Florida, heavy rain fell in many areas to the east of the storm's path. Much of southeast Florida received at least of precipitation, while over of rain fell in Homestead. Nearly all of Miami-Dade County was flooded to the south of Kendall Drive. Many businesses and homes in cities such as Homestead and Florida City suffered water damage. However, the worst damage was incurred to crops, which experienced a loss of over $17.26 million (1981 USD). One death and nearly $18.5 million in damage occurred in Florida. Further north, Dennis also caused flooding in the Carolinas, inundating many streets and causing crop damage in both states. A weather-related traffic accident in South Carolina resulted in two fatalities. Twenty families in Columbus County, North Carolina evacuated after the Waccamaw River overran its banks. Overall, Dennis caused three deaths and about $28.5 million in damage.
Meteorological history.
Satellite imagery indicated that a well-organized tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on August 5. The wave headed westward and organized further, developing into a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on August 7 while situated about south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. Early on August 8, satellite imagery indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dennis. The cyclone strengthened slightly further, reaching winds of 45 mph (75 km/h); wind shear prevented additional deepening and eventually caused Dennis to weaken to a tropical depression while approaching the Lesser Antilles on August 11 Early on August 12, the system crossed through the Windward Islands with a poorly defined circulation, making landfall in or passing close to Martinique. Dennis continued weakening after entering the Caribbean Sea, degenerating back into a tropical wave at 00:00 UTC on August 13 while located about south of Dominican Republic. 
The remnant tropical wave gradually curved northwestward and brushed western Jamaica on August 14. As the wave approached the south coast of central Cuba, it rapidly re-organized into a tropical cyclone, becoming a tropical depression again at 18:00 UTC on August 15. Around 00:00 UTC the following day, the depression re-intensified into a tropical storm and made landfall in Cuba near Playa Girón in Matanzas Province. Dennis moved northward across the island and emerged into the Straits of Florida near Cárdenas shortly after 06:00 UTC. While crossing the Straits of Florida, deep convection associated with the cyclone attempted to become concentrated near the center and develop an eyewall. However, interaction with a trough prevented Dennis from intensifying despite passing over warm sea surface temperatures. The storm decelerated while approaching Florida due to weak steering currents.
Late on August 16, Dennis moved across the middle Florida Keys as a minimal tropical storm. Between 06:00 UTC and 12:00 UTC on August 17, Dennis made landfall in rural mainland Monroe County with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). The cyclone moved slowly north-northeastward across Florida until emerging into the Atlantic just north of Cape Canaveral early on August 19. Dennis continued to deepen while moving offshore the Southeastern United States. The storm curved northeastward and made landfall near Emerald Isle, North Carolina,
with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Dennis then accelerated east-northeastward and soon re-emerged into the Atlantic from Hatteras Island. Later on August 20, a reconnaissance aircraft flight observed sustained winds of and a barometric pressure of – the lowest pressure associated with the storm. On this basis, Dennis was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on Saffir–Simpson scale at 18:00 UTC. The hurricane intensified slightly further, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) around 00:00 UTC on August 21. However, Dennis soon entered a region of increasingly colder sea surface temperatures, weakening into a tropical storm about six hours later. The system also began losing tropical characteristics, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone about 425 mi (685 km) south of Sable Island at 00:00 UTC on August 22. After Dennis became extratropical, the ship "Carista Express" observed sustained winds of . The remnants turned northward on August 24 and began weakening. By August 26, the extratropical storm was absorbed by a frontal system.

Dennis passed through the Caribbean Sea as a tropical depression and during its tropical wave stage, limiting impacts to heavy rainfall on Martinique, Saint Lucia, the Virgin Islands, Hispaniola, and the Greater Antilles. In Jamaica, portions of the island received about of precipitation. The resultant flooding forced the evacuation of dozens of residents and left at least 50 people homeless.
As Dennis approached the Florida Keys, several gale warnings were issued, with the first from Long Key to Dry Tortugas at 04:00 UTC on August 16. These gale warnings were posted progressively farther north along the East Coast of the United States, reaching as far north as Windmill Point in Virginia. Additionally, a hurricane watch was issued in South Florida from Fort Myers to Palm Beach, including the Florida Keys. Hundreds of people were evacuated from the campgrounds of Bahia Honda and John Pennekamp state parks. Shelters were also prepared to open in the Florida Keys if necessary. Typically, when a tropical cyclone approaches South Florida, the South Florida Water Management District drains Lake Okeechobee using the floodgates. However, due to a severe drought, water was instead directed into the lake from the connector canals. The storm resulted in a postponement of a second spraying to combat the spread of Mediterranean fruit flies in the Tampa Bay Area. About 40,000 tourists fled Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, including about 500 people from a campground, causing a loss of about $2 million to tourism. Some United States Military vessels were sent out to sea, while about 70 A-10 jets at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base were flown to England Air Force Base near Alexandria, Louisiana.
Rainfall totals in South Florida were generally between . However, little precipitation fell in Lake Okeechobee. Rainfall amounts in portions of southern Miami-Dade County ranged from , with a peak total of in Homestead. An aerial survey of Miami-Dade County indicated that an approximately area from the eastern edge of the Everglades from just south of Miami to the southern tip of Florida was flooded with of water – described as a "solid sheet of water from Kendall Drive all the way south" – while Homestead and West Kendall were inundated with water about in depth. At a trailer park in Homestead, water approached the doors of the mobile homes. A number of other homes in Homestead and Florida City were flooded. Many businesses in downtown Homestead closed after water began entering the buildings, with some store owners placing sandbags in front of their business. Dozens of cars were abandoned as roads began to flood. News reports noted that homes resembled islands, while roads were reduced to "an impassable goo." Flooding at Homestead Air Force Base forced officials to evacuate 86 aircraft.
There were major losses to commercial and residential buildings due to roof failures caused by Dennis. Damage to private property was estimated at slightly more than $983,000. Heavier losses was sustained to the agriculture of Florida due to slow draining water in some areas. Fruit and vegetable crops suffered just over $17.26 million in damage. Tropical vegetables and avocados in particular experienced extensive losses. Damage to the former reached about $5.1 million, with production losses occurring to of calabaza, cassava, eddoe, and sweet potatoes. Approximately of avocado trees were destroyed, causing a loss of more than 100,000 boxes, with the fruit suffering over $3.5 million in damage. The standing water also caused health issues for local residents, including septic tanks contaminating water wells. The storm spawned two tornadoes, one on Plantation Key and the other in northern Miami-Dade County, though both resulted in only minor damage. Approximately 122,500 businesses and homes in Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties were left without electricity, while more than 8,000 people lost telephone service – mostly in southern Miami-Dade County. Restoration of telephone services took over a week, with the telephone company suffering about $500,000 in damage. One death occurred in the area after a man attempted to drive in high water, but his car swerved and crashed into a palm tree. Overall, Dennis left nearly $18.5 million in damage in Florida.
In response to the flooding, Governor of Florida Bob Graham signed an executive order authorizing 10 high-axle combat vehicles and 20 National Guardsmen to assist in the evacuation of residents south of Miami. At least 25 households were rescued, while dozens of other families left before becoming stranded, some of them by canoe. Three evacuation shelters were opened for those displaced from their homes. On September 24, over a month after Dennis dropped heavy rainfall in far southeastern Florida, Governor Graham issued a disaster declaration for a area just outside the eastern Everglades, where standing water remained.
The storm also brought heavy rainfall to states farther north, such as South Carolina and North Carolina, where similar, but less extensive losses to agriculture occurred. In the former, areas from north of Charleston to northeast Horry County observed of precipitation in a 24-hour period. The Waccamaw River reached its highest level since 1945. In downtown Charleston, several streets were flooded, forcing residents to park their cars on higher ground several blocks away. Two deaths occurred in North Charleston as a result of a traffic accident. Much of southeastern North Carolina observed at least of precipitation, with a peak of of rainfall to the north of Wilmington. Many creeks and streams in that portion of the state swelled significantly. At Pireway, an unincorporated community in Columbus County, about 20 families evacuated after the Waccamaw River exceed its banks. Flooding caused about $10 million in damage to crops in the county. Inundation by water caused several roads to close in New Hanover, Pamlico, and Pender counties. Along the coasts of North Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware, gusty winds and abnormally high tides left generally minor erosion and coastal flooding, though some homes were damaged at Willoughby Spit in Norfolk, Virginia. About to the northeast of Virginia Beach, Virginia, a husband and wife on a schooner became caught in waves, though they were both rescued by the Coast Guard.

The War (Angels &amp; Airwaves song)

"The War" is a song by the American rock band Angels &amp; Airwaves. It was the fourth single from their debut studio album, "We Don't Need to Whisper" (2006), released on Geffen Records. The song impacted radio on October 10, 2006. It peaked at number nineteen on "Billboard" Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in 2007. Tom DeLonge has described this song as anti-war, with specific references to the Invasion of Normandy in World War II. "The War" was the last song the band would play, during their "We Don't Need to Whisper" concerts, with Tom making a speech during the bridge.
Videos.
Although "The War" never received an official music video, a short film and a live video were released. The short film depicts a futuristic environment, a battle on a beach where enemy combatants shoot up through the sand from an underground facility of some kind. After the battle, the underground facility is shown. In this facility, there is a character who is strapped to a hospital type bed. He breaks free and is shown escaping from the facility, running from the soldiers who occupy the facility and then becoming trapped on the top of a cliff with no place to go. As the enemy approaches the end of the video, the character falls backward off of the cliff. This character is played by Bradley Horne, which is notable because he also played the significant role of Captain Lee Briggs in the 2011 Angels and Airwaves Science Fiction film, Love.
Radio promo.
"The War" was released as a radio promo single only, but the disc for the single can be bought on various websites.
The video was played worldwide and in concert and raised 3.3 million dollars which immediately was transferred to the world's trust foundation.

Michał Pius Römer

Michał Pius Römer (; 28 May 1880 – 22 February 1945) was a Polish-Lithuanian lawyer, scientist and politician.
Early years.
Römer was born in Lithuania into a Polish noble family of Baltic-German (Livonian) origin. He was one of szlachta members loyal to the heritage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, referred to as Krajowcy. His father was Michał Kazimierz Römer and mother was Konstancja Tukałło.
He attended the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg (1893–1901) and later studied history in the Jagiellonian University in Kraków (1901–1902), after that he moved to Paris to study in "École des sciences politiques" (1902–1905). In Paris, he belonged to the organisation "Spójnia", where he headed the group "Lithuania", and was closely related to the . He gave the lecture on cultural-ethnographic situation in Lithuania in Café Voltaire, together with another Lithuanian activist, Tadas Ivanauskas. It was later published in Kraków by "Krytyka" under a title: "Stosunki etnograficzno-kulturalne na Litwie". 
In 1905, he returned to Lithuania, where he began to work for the restoration of Lithuanian statehood, not dominated by any nationalism. As he put it, he tried persuading the Lithuanian Poles to have "a common national citizenship () without renouncing cultural and national distinctions". To this end, he and founded the "Gazeta Wileńska", which was published from 15 February 1906. The radical paper was soon closed, on 7 July that year, although it already had 2,000 subscribers. Romer had to flee to Kraków, for fear of being arrested. 
In 1908 he wrote "Lithuania: Study of national revival" (). In his work he justified the Lithuanians' rights to their own statehood. He refuted accusations that Lithuanian activists were Russian agents. He also defended the right of Lithuanian Poles to preserve their own identity in the future Lithuanian state. 
Later that year he came back to Vilnius, when he continued his publicist work. He wrote works on Poles in Lithuania and Ruthenia and on Lithuanians in the Duchy of Prussia (, 1911). He joined the Society of Friends of Science in Wilno and accompanied Ludwik Krzywicki on his archaeological work in Samogitia.
World War I.
At the outbreak of World War I, Römer maintained contacts with independence and socialist circles in Warsaw, and distributed leaflets in Lithuania. He worked on the editorial board of the re-established "Przegląd Wileński". Römer took an oath as a lawyer in early 1915.
In March 1915, he took the Lithuanian politicians Mykolas Sleževičius and Jurgis Šaulys to Warsaw for a meeting with Stanisław Patek. Römer left Vilnius on May 27, 1915 and went via Odesa to Romania and then to Galicia. At the delegation of the Supreme National Committee (NKN), he was accepted into the Polish Legions and sent to the Press Office of the Military Department of the NKN in Piotrków. In August, he submitted an extensive memorandum to the Supreme National Committee entitled "Lithuania at War" (). On August 28, 1915, he left Piotrków, wanting to take part in the armed struggle. On September 14, 1915, after a personal conversation with Józef Piłsudski in Kovel, he was assigned to the 1st Legions Infantry Regiment and, under the pseudonym , took part in the Volhynia campaign as a private. He soon fell ill and was hospitalized for a longer period - in Rzeszów, then Kraków, where he stayed until February 1916. 
After a period of service in the Military Department of the NKN, in September 1916 he returned to the 1st Legions Infantry Regiment's 1st Battalion's 1st Company to the front to Grywiatka, then with the regiment to Baranavichy and Łomża. During the Oath crisis in July 1917, he refused to take the oath of allegiance to the German Emperor and on July 18, 1917, he was interned in the camp in Szczypiorno. In August 1917, thanks to the efforts of his Warsawian friends, he was released from the camp and was nominated as a justice of the peace in Kolno in the Kingdom of Poland, and after a year he was transferred to the position of district judge in Łomża.
Interwar.
Polish–Lithuanian War.
In March 1919 he came to Warsaw at the request of Józef Piłsudski. Piłsudski sent him to Kaunas to head a government composed of Poles and Lithuanians. Romer arrived in Kaunas on 15 April, but his plans were rejected by Lithuanian politicians. He then returned to Vilnius, which was then in Polish hands, but did not take up any public office. In September 1920, after the Lithuanian army had retaken Vilnius, he became the head of "Gazeta Krajowa". The paper supported Lithuanian statehood, respecting the Polish language and culture. After the capture of Vilnius by General Lucjan Żeligowski, he went to Kaunas and in a letter to Józef Piłsudski protested against the violation of Lithuania's rights to its capital. He chose instead to move to Kaunas, which had become the temporary capital of the recently re-established independent Republic of Lithuania.
1920–1939.
He was a notable figure in the interwar Lithuania, and was a member of the Supreme Tribunal of Lithuania (1921–1928) and the State Council of Lithuania (1928–1931). He was a professor at the University of Lithuania/Vytautas Magnus University (1922–1940), Vilnius University (1940–1945), and the rector of the University of Lithuania for three terms (1927–1928, 1933–36 and 1936–1939). As an international lawyer, in 1932 he represented Lithuania at the Permanent Court of International Justice regarding the Klaipėda Directorate. The court found in Lithuania's favor that Otto Böttcher had violated the Klaipėda Convention. He published a work on this matter entitled: (1936).
Römer wrote important works on Lithuanian history and on law, such as the 1908 book and the 1928 book . He is considered to be one of the most prominent Lithuanian jurists, the progenitor, first lector and one of the most prominent authors of interwar Lithuanian constitutional law. While most of his writings on Lithuanian law were written in Lithuanian and his signature on Lithuanian documents and letters was "Mykolas Römeris", (sometimes also credited as "Mykolas Rėmeris" or "Mykolas Riomeris"), he continued to write his diary in Polish and use the German form of his name ("Michael von Römer") for his law writings in German. He did not break his ties with Polishness, and still was publishing in Polish, for example "Listy z Kowna" ("Letters from Kaunas"). He willingly visited Poland and hosted Polish personalities visiting Lithuania.
World War II.
In February 1940 he moved to Vilnius, where the Lithuanian University, of which he was rector, had been transferred. He organised meetings of Lithuanian and Polish activists in an attempt to find common ground. He remained in this position after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania. After the university was closed down by the Germans, he took part in secret teaching. He maintained contacts with the Polish underground movement. He returned to the university after the Red Army occupied Vilnius again in 1944. He died on 22 February 1945. He was buried on Rasos Cemetery.
Commemoration.
The Law University of Lithuania in Vilnius was renamed to the Mykolas Romeris University in 2004.

Polskie Górnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo

Polskie Górnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo S.A. (en: Polish Oil Mining and Gas Extraction S.A.), abbreviated to PGNiG, was a Polish state-controlled oil and gas company, headquartered in Warsaw, Poland. The company has branches and representative offices in Russia, Pakistan, Belarus and Ukraine and holds equity interests in some 30 subsidiaries, including providers of specialist geophysical, drilling and well services.
PGNiG was one of the largest companies in Poland, the largest Polish oil and gas exploration and production company and was listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
History.
Foundation and early history (1976–1995).
PGNiG was established as a state-owned enterprise on September 1, 1982. The company was a successor of the Union of Oil and Gas Mining, which was created by a merger of the Polish Union of Gas Industry and the Oil Industry Union in 1976.
Company development (1996–2012).
In 1996, the company was transformed into a joint-stock company, owned by the state treasury. In 2004, PGNiG Przesyl Sp. z.o.o. (today OGP GAZ-SYSTEM S.A.) was established and became the first step in transforming the company's ownership structure. In 2005, PGNiG was listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
In 2005, PGNiG signed a three-year contract with the government of Pakistan to explore in the Kirthar region, in a joint-venture with Pakistan Petroleum (30%). In the same year the company set up another joint-venture with German Verbundnetz Gas.
In 2006, the company first began plans for the Świnoujście LNG terminal (Polskie LNG terminal).
In 2007 and following years, PGNiG and Gazprom had various heated exchanges about pipeline operator EuRoPol Gaz, a Polish-Russian joint venture that operates the Yamal pipeline, after Gazprom had demanded an increase in shareholder rights. In the following year, Polish oil refiner Lotos and PGNiG signed a deal to jointly explore for Norwegian offshore oil.
Following the Russia–Ukraine gas dispute in 2009, Poland and PGNiG began construction of the President Lech Kaczyński LNG Terminal.
In 2011, PGNiG purchased 99.8% of Vattenfall Heat Poland's assets for PLN 2.96bn, becoming the owner of Elektrociepłownia Warszawskie. In the same year, the company started large-scale exploration for possible shale-gas reserves in Poland. The first shale gas was produced from a well in northern Poland within the same year, and commercial production levels were expected to be reached by 2014. In discussions about the impact of shale-gas extraction (fracking), PGNiG officials stated, that regulation should happen on national levels and not be decided by institutions like the EU. In 2012, Poland granted 111 shale-gas exploration licenses.
In 2011, PGNiG was excluded from developing a gas field in Iran.
In 2012, Polish chemical company Tarnow announced to partner with PGNiG in building a 130 megawatts gas-fuelled heat and power plant.
At the end of 2012, one of the main investment projects for the development of natural gas and crude oil fields in the Lubiatów-Międzychód-Grotów region (LMG project) was completed. Test production had started in early August. The newly erected facilities and 14 wells were expected to produce around 100 million cubic metres of natural gas and 300,000 tonnes of crude oil, and together with another Norwegian project, doubled PGNiG's total oil production levels.
Poland and PGNiG had been following plans to reduce dependence on Russian gas for several years. Following the increase of costs for gas imports from Russia in 2012, the company announced a two-year plan to reduce costs and sell non-essential company assets, while also preparing for two subsidiary IPO's in 2013. The company also ended pricing negotiations with Gazprom in November 2012, agreeing to change a pricing-formula from contracts signed in 1996.
Recent history (2013–today).
In September 2013, the consolidation of all gas companies within the PNGiG consortium into one company, under the name Polska Spółka Gazownictwa, was completed. In December 2013, PGNiG announced a cooperation with Chevron in order to scale-up their shale-gas operations faster. 
On August 1, 2014, PGNiG OBRÓT DETALICZNY was separated from the current structure of PGNiG SA. Its establishment was dictated by legal conditions and the need to prepare for the upcoming full liberalisation of the gas market in Poland. As a result of the change, all retail customer service in the field of natural gas and electricity sales were transferred to the new company. Following these steps in deregulation of the Polish energy market, PGNiG was one of the first companies to directly trade on the nation's gas exchange. In 2014, as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War, PGNiG reported a reduction of gas deliveries from Russia by 45%. As part of this reduction, PGNiG had to temporarily cut their gas exports to Ukraine.
In 2015, PGNiG expanded their cooperation with PKN, jointly exploring for oil and gas in the south-east of Poland.
In June 2016, the President Lech Kaczyński LNG Terminal received the first commercial cargo of liquefied natural gas under a commercial contract between PGNiG SA and Qatar's LNG producer QatarEnergy LNG. Another LNG cargo was delivered from Norway's Statoil, totaling around 140,000 tons.
In 2017, Qatargas signed a new LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with PGNiG, agreeing to deliver two million tonnes per annum (MTPA), starting on 1 January 2018 (until June 2034). The company also announced the first LNG delivery from the United States, which became the first LNG cargo shipment from the US Europe. In March of the same year, Polish energy firms PGNiG, PGE and Energa announced a total investment of $127 million into Poland's coal mining firm PGG. More than half of the investment came from PGNiG. The three companies had become PGG investors in the previous year. In 2017, PGNiG first signed a gas storage agreement with Ukraine's Ukrtransgaz, which was extended in 2018. By April 2022, PGNiG had ordered seven LNG carriers.
In June 2018, PGNiG signed an agreement with Port Arthur LNG to supply Poland with LNG from the Port Arthur facility in Jefferson County, Texas, United States.
In November 2018, PGNiG signed a long-term contract with Cheniere Marketing International. It secures liquefied natural gas supplies from the United States of America.
In December 2018, PGNiG won an exploration licence for blocks in the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). For organizational and nonadministrative purposes, the company will establish a local office in the emirate.
In June 2019, PGNiG agreed with its US counterpart Venture Global for an annual increment of 1.5 million metric tons from the Plaquemines terminal. Thus, the volume of liquefied gas from the Plaquemines terminal will increase from 1.5 to 2.5 million tons per year.
In July 2019, PGNiG Upstream Norway, a subsidiary of the PGNiG bought 20% of the Duva field from Wellesley Petroleum.
On 14 July 2020, PKN Orlen announced its intention to take over PGNiG, and on 10 May 2021, it submitted a takeover application to the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection.
In September 2021, PGNiG bought Ineos' oil and gas business in Norway in a $650 million deal. The deal includes all of Ineos' oil and gas business in production, licenses, fields, facilities and pipelines of Ineos on the Norwegian continental shelf.
In 2021, PGNiG was ranked no. 58 in the Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI) that covers 120 oil, gas, and mining companies involved in resource extraction north of the Arctic Circle.
In September 2022, PGNiG signed a major deal to buy natural gas from Equinor, which was considered one of the major energy companies. Under the agreement, PGNiG will receive 2.4 billion cubic meters of gas per year for 10 years, as the gas will pass through the new Baltic pipeline project. This step comes in an attempt by the government to replace Russian gas and diversify gas supplies in the country.
In October 2022, Shareholders of PGNiG approved the company's takeover by PKN Orlen, this came after PKN Orlen Shareholders done the same.
Relation to Russia.
As part of Polish plan to become fully energy independent from Russia within the next few years, Piotr Wozniak, president of the company, stated in February 2019: "The strategy of the company is just to forget about Eastern suppliers and especially about Gazprom." In 2020, the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce ruled that PGNiG's long-term contract gas price with Gazprom linked to oil prices should be changed to approximate the Western European gas market price, backdated to 1 November 2014 when PGNiG requested a price review under the contract. Gazprom had to refund about $1.5 billion to PGNiG. The 1996 Yamal pipeline related contract is for up to 10.2 billion cubic metres of gas per year until it expires at the end of 2022, with a minimum annual amount of 8.7 billion cubic metres. Following the 2021 global energy crisis, PGNiG made a further price review request on 28 October 2021. PGNiG stated the recent extraordinary increases in natural gas prices "provides a basis for renegotiating the price terms on which we purchase gas under the Yamal Contract."
In the light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, gas supply from Russia became even more difficult. According to PGNiG, the Russian energy firm Gazprom had told it on April 26, 2022, all gas deliveries to Poland would be halted from 08:00 CET the next day. Gazprom stated that the suspension under new rules announced a month before, which mean "unfriendly" countries must pay for gas in rubles. PGNiG has always refused to do this. At this time, PGNiG relied on Gazprom for the majority of its gas imports and bought 53% of its imports from Russia in the first quarter of 2022.

Chattenden and Upnor Railway

The Chattenden and Upnor Railway (also known as the Lodge Hill and Upnor Railway) was a narrow gauge railway serving the military barracks and depot at Upnor, Kent, and associated munitions and training depots. It started life in the early 1870s as a standard-gauge railway. The narrow gauge working began in 1885, initially in a mixed gauge formation with the standard gauge, and post circa 1903 2 ft. 6 in. gauge exclusively. In the latter form the line continued in use until the end of 1961.
History.
Precursors.
The first railway at Chattenden was a standard gauge line laid by the Royal Engineers in the early 1870s. This was used to bring building materials from a wharf at Upnor to be used in the construction of the Chattenden Munitions Depot. According to a report in the issue of "Iron" dated Saturday 29 May 1875: "A detachment of non-commissioned officers and men of the Royal Engineers, commanded by Lieutenant Barker, on Saturday left the School of Military Engineering at Chatham for Upnor, where they will be quartered for some time, as they are to be employed to lay down lines of rails to connect forts on the Thames and Medway with the new powder magazines to be constructed at Chattenden Roughs, a few miles from the old magazines at Upnor Castle. It is expected that more than forty miles of these railways will be constructed." This railway fell out of use when the building work was completed.
An railway is thought to have been laid to help with the construction of the standard gauge line. An locomotive, called "Burgoyne", built by Manning Wardle in 1873 (works no. 448), would have been used in construction, although it may also have been used on the Chatham Eastern Defences 18 inch gauge railway and worked on Borstal Prison construction work. "Burgoyne" was identical as built to "Busy Bee" (Manning Wardle 424 of 1872 for the Admiralty at Chatham Dockyard) and was a member of the classic Manning Wardle '6 by 8' 0-4-0ST specification.
Opening.
In 1885, members of the Royal School of Military Engineering laid an experimental gauge railway on the trackbed of the standard gauge line, initially retaining the standard gauge as a third rail in at least some places. The steep gradients involved allowed the engineers to test the effectiveness of narrow-gauge railways over hilly terrain (according to an article in 'The Locomotive' magazine in 1903, some standard gauge was still extant at this stage). The last standard gauge locomotives were transferred to the Royal Arsenal at some stage between 1898 and 1906.The 1885 gauge adaptation was at the behest of Royal Engineers officers such as Major John Hogg, who were mindful of the shortcomings of the 18 inch gauge lines laid during the abortive Suakin Campaign of the Spring that year. At the time gauge railways were being used extensively in the North-West Frontier Province of India.
Sadly, although no steam locomotives of the Royal Engineers era on the C. &amp; U.R. currently survive, probably the main legacy of the railway in this era was the use of 36 2 ft. 6 in. gauge Bagnall 2-4-2ST's supplied to the Indian States Military Railways in 1901-5 as a Strategic Reserve. Examples saw use in Mesopotamia during World War One and two survive in India today. The locomotives, although of a different wheel arrangement, showed a marked family resemblance to Bagnall 1514 of 1897 (see below).
World Wars.
The Chattenden and Upnor Railway line was taken over by the Admiralty on 1 April 1906. Two new locomotives, "Fisher" and "Chevalier" were purchased just after the start of the First World War to deal with the rise in munitions traffic. In 1918, five Greenwood and Batley battery-electric locomotives were purchased, to work the lines into the munitions stores where steam locomotives were a fire risk.
In 1931 the railway had 91 powder wagons, 16 box wagons to carry ammunition, 17 assorted wagons for ballast, an officers‘ carriage, 7 workmen‘s carriages, 3 brake vans, and a breakdown van.
Two final steam locomotives, "Burnett Hall" and "Norbury" were purchased in 1933 and 1934. These were the main locomotives in use at the start of the Second World War. In 1943, the first of a series of diesel locomotives were purchased.
Closure.
By 1896, the last of the Hoo branch had been lifted, with the remainder removed by 1909.
By 1941, the section of the branch from Upnor to the Tank Field signal box was mostly out of use, and the remaining section to Pontoon Hard (Upper Upnor) was closed. The rest of the line closed on 31 December 1961. The track was lifted in December 1965.
Passenger services.
The line was never opened to the public, but passenger services were run for munitions workers. In 1891 there were nine passenger trains running each day.
During the Second World War, passenger trains were revived using bogie carriages built by Charles Roberts &amp; Co. Ltd. in 1942. These continued until 19 May 1961.
Route.
The railway started at the Lodge Hill munitions depot, at interchange sidings with the standard gauge Chattenden Naval Tramway. It curved around the west end of Chattenden Magazines Enclosure to Lutnor Junction, where a branch ran back into the magazines. The main line continued southeast for to Chattenden Barracks, where the line's locomotive sheds and workshops were located. A long branch ran east from here to the village of Hoo.
South of Chattenden Barracks, the line rose on an embankment to cross the A228 road on an overbridge. It then continued south to Upnor Junction, where two branches ran down to the bank of the River Medway. One branch ran west past Tank Field, to the Upper Pontoon Hard near Frindsbury. The other ran into the Upnor Depot.
The railway had several sections of steep gradients. From Upnor Depot to Church Crossing the line rose at 1 in 26, from there to Upnor Junction the gradient was 1 in 30. There was also a section of 1 in 34 approaching the west gate of Lodge Hill depot.
Accidents.
On 17 March 1907, Colonel Brabazon, the senior officer at Lodge Hill Depot, had a photograph taken of the 78 employees. The locomotive "Lancashire" hauled a special train to bring all the employees up to the depot. The driver was in the group, waiting for the photograph to be taken when the locomotive began to move. It ran away on the downhill gradient in the direction of Upnor and derailed on the curve around Issingham Barracks. The line only had a 5-ton jackscrew and a large crew spent most of the next day re-railing the locomotive.
2 ft. 6 in. gauge locomotives.
Battery-electric.
A large number of battery-electric locomotives were used, mainly to move munitions around the Lodge Hill depot. Six supplied in 1928 were also suitable for use on the main line. They had central cabs with large square-cornered windows and tramway skirts covering the wheels. These were replaced by six Greenwood and Batley 8-ton locomotives built between 1938 and 1945.
The rest of the battery-electric fleet were motorised wagons without cabs that were restricted to use in the depot. Twenty-four were supplied by Greenwood and Batley in batches between 1918 and 1948. Seven came from Wingrove &amp; Rogers and two were built in the workshops at Lodge Hill.

Gholhak

Gholhak or Qolhak () is a neighborhood located in District 3 of Tehran Municipality. It is bounded on the east by the Darrous neighborhood (Fakourian Street), on the west by the Gholhak River, on the north by the British Embassy Garden, and on the south by the Pourmeshkani Street and Zafar Street (Dastgerdi).
The area has had several aqueducts since ancient times, some of which are still in use. The water of the current aqueduct in the embassy, which is very large and still flowing, irrigates the old sycamore trees in the area. In Gholhak area, there are two mosques called Jame Mosque and Gholhak Aazam Mosque. Its oldest mosque is the Aazam Mosque of Gholhak, where palm trees are brought out for mourning during the days of Tasua and Ashura. Also, the bathroom of the people of Gholhak, located in Jalali Street, next to the Shariati dead end, which was known as old Hafez Bath until several years ago, is currently closed. This bath is nearly a hundred years old and its construction date is unknown. Evidence shows that the aqueduct's water, which flowed into the pool from the British embassy and was burned in the oven by the leaves of trees and timber, heated the water and bathed the residents. Has been.
History.
This neighborhood was thirteen kilometers south of Imamzadeh Saleh on the asphalt road. Its population during the Qajar period is estimated at one thousand people. This village is considered to be the first village of Shemiran and from there several rivers have branched around. One went to the foreign embassy, the other to the aristocratic palaces and court gardens of courtiers or employees. Manouchehr Sotoudeh in his book is limited and describes the characteristics of Gholhak as follows: Gholhak is located on both sides of the old road of Shemiran and is limited from the north to Tajrish and from the south to the lands of Chalharz and Davodieh and from the east to the lessons. And from the west to the hills of Elahieh and part of Zargandeh.
The first phone call from Shemiran to Tehran was made from Gholhak on the phone number of the house on the home telephone alley (currently Shahid Yazdanian).
Etymology.
Gholha means small peak; and the word is compounded from Ghol and the suffix "kāf" (-ak), which is a sign of change. Morteza Razfar on the name of Gholhak says: "It was said that after a while, it became Gholhak." There is evidence in Gholhak Hosseiniyah located in Gholhak Grand Mosque that confirms this; for example, Qalahak has been engraved on many buildings, columns, and other structures.
Famous residents.
Mohammad Beheshti and Morteza Motahhari were famous residents of Gholhak. Seyyed Alireza Beheshti, the son of Mohammad Beheshti, says: There were several shops on the street of our house. Laundry, butchers, fruit shops, bakeries, and oil shops were among the busiest and busiest shops in our neighborhood. The reason for naming Motahhari Street is that a very religious market person named Mr. Motahhari lived above our alley. The old name of Shahid Siddiq Street used to be called Turaj, and the name of this alley (Beheshti) was logical in older times, which I think was named after Colonel Manteghi, who once lived here.
In the old days, most of the houses in this neighborhood were one-story or two-story, and most of the residents were middle-class and relatively up-and-coming people, most of whom were employees. The river was almost the same, except that it had a wooden bridge that connected the neighborhood, and it was so narrow that only one car could cross it.
Ayatollah Beheshti's house was bought by Tehran Municipality, and was opened as a museum house later in July 2013.
Abbas Kiarostami, born in Gholhak neighborhood, also completed his high school education at Jam Gholhak School.
Gholhak metro station.
On August 4, 1975, the Children's Park and Library No. 7 in Gholhak will be inaugurated by the Mayor of Tehran, Taghi Sarlak.
In the 1980s, due to the development of the Tehran Metro, Gholhak Children's Park and the library were completely destroyed and turned into a workshop for the construction of the metro station. Finally, in May 2009, Gholhak Metro Station was inaugurated by Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and Mohsen Hashemi, the then Mayor and CEO of Tehran Metro.
Historical events.
Of all the meetings held in the garden of the British Embassy, the most mysterious was the meeting of the Freemasons in this garden. During the first Pahlavi period (1925–41), although he was fired from his job due to a dispute between Reza Shah and Mohammad Ali Foroughi, the terrible, powerful, and invisible groups of Freemasons came out of the British memorial in Gholhak Garden and Reza Shah was forced to return Foroughi.
Foroughi, who was himself the Grand Master of the Masonic Lodges in Iran, often met with representatives from the United States and Britain, including the British ambassador, at the Qolhak Garden Memorial, and tried to figure out the history of Iran. The reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (1941–79) was one of the results of these meetings.

Dejvice

Dejvice is a historical community, a municipal quarter of the Prague 6 district of Prague, Czech Republic. Its history can be traced back to the late Roman era. Dejvice is known for its appeal to the upper middle class, foreign diplomatic corps and as a university district. It is also the home to Dukla Prague, one of the most successful football clubs of the Czechoslovak era.
History.
While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact time in which Dejvice came into existence, archeologists have uncovered a pit that dates back to the late Roman Era. This find is the first preserved archeological site in Prague history. Other than this not much is known until the 10th century when Dejvice, and other towns in the current Prague 6 municipality, came under the auspices of the Břevnov Monastery. The history of modern Dejvice begins in the 1920s. During this time the city was an affluent neighborhood of Prague. Orchards were planted on the surrounding hills. Václav Havel lived in Dejvice during this time. The tram line was established incorporate with a trolleybus by wartime. The build up of the quarter also continued. From the Victory Square it sequentially shifted to the North to neighborhood. During the war, the Hotel International Prague was completed in 1950 and was intended to mimic the architecture of Moscow. After the fall of communism it was renamed the "Hotel Crowne Plaza". The town surrounds a square entitled, Vítězné náměstí (Victory Square). In 1978 the metro line was extended to Dejvice (station was named Leninova, now it is Dejvická). Today's motorway, called Evropska also appeared at that time. That time it was also called Leninova. The airport, united with the center of Prague, and that newly built neighborhood, by a sequence of primary streets.
Character of the quarter.
The architecture of Dejvice was greatly influenced by Czech architect Antonín Engel during the 1920s, when he developed new housing settlements that still stand today. Dejvice is a relatively luxurious residential quarter, catering to the educated elite.
Dejvice is a home to multiple universities with many students. It is home to the main campus of Czech Technical University, University of Chemistry and Technology, newly built Czech National Library of Technology, as well as Catholic Theological Faculty of Charles University.
Hanspaulka league.
The Hanspaulka League, which was the most popular amateur football league in Czechoslovakia, originated in Dejvice. It began in 1972 with eight teams. The league has now grown to over 790 teams. The league is broken into eight divisions based on skill and quality of play. Each game features six players per side and are played on small pitches. The league began four years after the Soviet suppression of the Prague Spring as a means of self-determination for the Czechs. It was staffed by many of the intellectuals and students who participated in the 1968 events.
Transport.
Dejvice is linked with the center of Prague by tram lines (8, 18, 20, 26). The metro line A stop's in Dejvice at the Dejvická metro station, and gets to the heart of the city in minutes.

<doc id="7031297" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7031297" title="Binary-safe">
Binary-safe

A binary-safe function is one that treats its input as a raw stream of bytes and ignores every textual aspect it may have. The term is mainly used in the PHP programming language to describe expected behaviour when passing binary data into functions whose main responsibility is text and string manipulating, and is used widely in the official PHP documentation.
Binary-safe file read and write.
While all textual data can be represented in binary-form, it must be done so through character encoding. In addition to this, how newlines are represented may vary depending on the platform used. Windows, Linux and macOS all represent newlines differently in binary form. This means that reading a file as binary data, parsing it as text and then writing it back to disk (thus reconverting it back to binary form) may result in a different binary representation than the one originally used.
Most programming languages let the programmer decide whether to parse the contents of a file as text, or read it as binary data. To convey this intent, special flags or different functions exist when reading or writing files to disk. For example, in the PHP, C, and C++ programming languages, developers have to use codice_1 instead of codice_2 to read the file as a binary stream instead of interpreting the textual data as such. This may also be referred to as reading in 'binary safe' mode.

Neocarzinostatin

Neocarzinostatin (NCS) is a macromolecular chromoprotein enediyne antitumor antibiotic secreted by "Streptomyces macromomyceticus".
It consists of two parts, a labile chromophore (the non-protein molecular entity shown at right) and a 113 amino acid protein to which the chromophore is tightly and non-covalently bound with high affinity (Kd ~ 10−10 M). The non-protein component is a very potent DNA-damaging agent; However it is extremely unstable and the role of the protein is to protect it and release it to the target DNA. Opening of the epoxide under reductive conditions present in cells creates favorable conditions for a Bergman cyclization, leading to formation of a benzenoid diradical, followed by DNA strand cleavage. Another important member of the chromoprotein group of natural products is kedarcidin.
As a medicine it is among the most potent, and in Japan only it has been used against liver cancer clinically. 
Biosynthesis of NCS Chromophore.
The biosynthesis of neocarzinostatin takes place through a convergence of the activities of a gene cluster, which includes two separate iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) and deoxy sugar biosynthetic pathways. The first type I PKS gene, NcsE, codes for the enediyne moiety. The second type I PKS gene, NcsB, codes for the naphthoic acid moiety. Additionally, a cluster of "NcsC" genes are responsible for coding enzymes for the synthesis of the deoxyamino sugar moiety of NCS chromophore. The biosynthesis can be divided into three preliminary steps with a final convergence of the three moieties:
1. Synthesis of deoxyaminosugar moiety: This part is carried out by the enzymes encoded by a cluster of seven genes, named "NcsC" through "Ncs6". Since, these enzymes have similarity to dNDP-D-mannose synthases, it has been proposed that, the synthesis starts from D-mannose-1-phosphate. Since the C-2 hydroxyl group (-OH) is ultimately eliminated, the possibility of having D-glucose-1-phosphate cannot also be ruled out. However, additional studies indicate that, D-mannose-1-phosphate is the more likely starting point.
2. Synthesis of naphthoic acid moiety: "NcsB", "NcsB1", "NcsB2" and "NcsB3" are enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the naphthoic acid moiety. This is similar to other enediyne natural products, the genes involved in construction of the aromatic moiety are an iterative type I PKS rather than a type II PKS system. The methyl group on the phenol group is added by SAM.
3. Synthesis of enediyne moiety and convergent assembly: The enediyne is synthesized by 14 enzymes encoded by "NcsE" to "NcsE11" plus "NcsF1" and "NcsF2". "NcsE" to "NcsE11" constitute another iterative type I PKS, while "NcsF1" and "NcsF2" have epoxide hydrolase activity.
Finally, the building blocks are assembled in a convergent fashion. Ncs6 glycosyltransferase catalyzes the coupling between the enediyne core and the dNDP-deoxyaminosugar. The naphthoyl group is attached to the enediyne core by the enzyme NcsB2 CoA ligase. There is an additional carbonate functionality added, probably originating from CO2 (or bicarbonate), however, it remains to be determined whether this step is truly enzymatic.

Yusef Abad

Yusef Abad (also transliterated as Yousef Abad, Yusuf Abad, Yusof Abad, Yousuf Abad; , ) is an old neighbourhood of Tehran, consisting of an area developed through nearly parallel streets including; Sayed Jamaleddin Asad Abadi (usually considered to be the main street of Yusef Abad area), Ibn-e-Sina (Avicena or Poor Sina), Jahan Ara, Mahram (Modabber), and Akbari (Mostowfi). The latter is the most beautiful, and seemingly the most expensive part of it. The area was first built by Mirza Yusef Ashtiani Mostowfi ul-Mamalek in north-west of Dar-ol Xelafe Naseri, so was named after his name as Yusef Abad locality.
People residing there are, generally expected to be, of upper middle class, well-off, and prestigious. The area is located in the north-central part of the city and is served by Valiasr Street, as well as Kordestan and Hemmat Expressways.
Three parks are, commonly supposed to be, the most reputable recreation centers in the region; Shafaq park, almost in the middle of the area, wherein Shafaq public library, and the well-known Shafaq or Student Community/Cultural Center are located. Second one is Qezel-Qale (translated as Red Castle) park, which is located at the beginning of Jahan Ara street. This place used to be a part of the former Qezel-Qale prison that has been abandoned for many years. The latter is Dustan (translated as Friends) park, that is situated on the northern part of Yusef Abad.
Yusef Abad has a gas station and a cinema/theater. The Yusef Abad Police Station is located on the corner of Asad Abadi Square (formerly known as Kalantari Square, translated as Police Station Square).
The locality is one of the major neighbourhoods in Tehran with the highest population of Iranian Jews. Others are Oudlajan, Gisha, Sheikh Hadi, and Gorgan.
Yusef Abad is host to a few synagogues, also one of the largest in north of the city, named Yusef Abad Synagogue.
The area is home to some of the first and prominent residential skyscrapers in Tehran, the A.S.P. Towers. The towers are located on the corner of Kordestan and Hakim Highways. These well-built constructions were completed in 1976, and have been landmarks ever since.
Tehran International Tower is also situated just behind the A.S.P. Towers. The skyscraper has the title of the tallest residential tower in Iran.

Store Street Aqueduct

The Store Street Aqueduct in central Manchester, England, was built in 1798 by Benjamin Outram on the Ashton Canal. A Grade II* listed building, it is built on a skew of 40° across Store Street, and is believed to be the first major aqueduct of its kind in Great Britain and the oldest still in use today.
Aqueduct.
The aqueduct was constructed to cross Shooters Brook. It is built of stone with large voussoirs and retaining walls of coursed masonry and is wide with triangular buttresses. The brook was culverted in about 1805 and Store Street was built over it. The canal is about wide and deep. The arch has a square span and a skew span rising above road level.
Generally, where a canal (or later a railway) crossed a road, or vice versa, the road would be diverted to cross at right angles. It had not always been acceptable but attempts to build masonry arch bridges at an angle, or "skew", of greater than 15 degrees had proved unsatisfactory. The method up to that time had been to build the voussoir arch with the stone coursework parallel to the abutments. This transmitted the load outward from the crown in a straight line to the foundations, parallel to the faces of the arch. If a skew was attempted, it threw the lines of force outside the abutments, leading to weakness in the structure.
William Chapman had partially solved the problem in 1787 when building bridges for the Kildare Canal, the first being the Finlay Bridge near Naas, Ireland. The Kildare was part of the Grand Canal Company, for which William Jessop had been the engineer. Jessop would no doubt have discussed it with Outram, his partner, and he experimented with the idea on the Rochdale Canal. Examples are Gorrell's Lane and March Barn road bridges, though built possibly later. The method used was to build timber falsework parallel to the proposed arches. Planks were laid on the falsework parallel to the abutments. The position of the courses at the crown were marked out, then those across the remainder of the arch.
Although the aqueduct still exists and is structurally sound, years of neglect led to water leakage through the joints, and the spiral construction can no longer be seen, the surface of the intrados having been rendered.
Later railway engineers improved on the system, producing what became known as helicoidal construction that became the norm in English skew bridge building. An exact solution to the problem was determined in the form of the French, or orthogonal, design. However, this was complicated and expensive to build.

Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange

The Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange (TTSE) is the main stock exchange in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, and the largest stock exchange in the Caribbean region by market capitalization.
As a member-state of CARICOM several companies from Barbados, Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Eastern Caribbean Securities Exchange also cross-list their stocks onto the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange.
The unique four symbol alphanumeric Market Identifier Code (MIC) used to identify the TTSE as defined under ISO 10383 is XTRN.
History.
Foundation and establishment.
The Securities Market which informally existed in Trinidad &amp; Tobago for well over twenty years prior to the opening of the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Stock Exchange really achieved significance in the early 1970s when the Government decided as a matter of policy to localise the foreign owned commercial banking and manufacturing sectors of the economy. The thrust of the policy was to get such companies to divest and sell a majority of their shares to nationals.
Two bodies chosen to effect this policy were the Capital Issues Committee which was set up by the Ministry of Finance in July 1970 to direct developments in the primary market and the Call Exchange (an association of share dealers) which was established under the umbrella of the Central Bank in August 1965 to monitor activities in the secondary market.
Parallel to this development in the public sector in the early 1970s was the rapid establishment of private institutions such as trust companies and stock broking firms to satisfy the demands of investors in both the primary and secondary markets.
With such infrastructure in place and the concomitant increase in the securities business the decision was taken to establish a securities market within a framework of established Rules and Regulations to facilitate the development of the domestic capital market.
The establishment of the Stock Exchange under the provisions of the Securities Industry Act 1981 was a natural extension of the policy to formalise the securities market in Trinidad and Tobago. This Act was proclaimed on 23 October 1981 and the Stock Exchange was formally opened on 26 October 1981 under the auspices of the Ministry of Finance.
1995 Regulatory issues and updated legislation.
Over the years and leading up to the current time, there was no doubt that the original Securities Law, that is, The Securities Industry Act, 1981 became ineffective. In attempting to bring both Primary and Secondary market activity under one umbrella, the Act created confusion, and for the most part the provisions were unenforceable.
This was because the Exchange as a regulatory Organisation, had no discretion to reasonably moderate the strict and unreasonable application of the letter of the Act once a particular provision was not explicitly stated in the Act. The Ministry of Finance, in recognizing this problem, worked with the Exchange to introduce a more dynamic piece of legislation.
As a remedial measure, the Government, through the Ministry of Finance, passed legislation repealing the 1981 Act and replacing it with the Securities Industry Act of 1995 which brought into operation the establishment of a Securities and Exchange Commission.
The 1995 Act vests with the Commission, the authority to maintain surveillance over the securities market and ensure orderly, fair and equitable dealings in securities. Furthermore, all market actors, meaning issuers, underwriters, investment advisers, stockbrokers and dealers, etc. must register with the Commission, who will be responsible for controlling and supervising their activities. The Exchange on the other hand will regulate trading on the secondary market, as well as the activities of the Members of the Exchange, subject of course to the oversight by the Commission.
On December 31, 2012 the Securities Industry Act of 1995 was repealed and replaced by the Securities Act, 2012.
2007 - present.
The TTSE experienced some slowdown, both in terms of activity and listings from legislation which restricted institutions from holding more than 10% of their portfolio in any single company's shares. The Great Recession also contributed to a depressed state of liquidity, listings and pricing on the TTSE. This was further compounded by the slowdown in the Trinidad and Tobago economy stemming from depressed commodity (oil and gas) prices from 2014 onwards. Despite this, there has been a number of large cap listings, including the listings of First Citizen's Bank and the Trinidad and Tobago Natural Gas Company Limited.
Trading.
In August 2018, the TTSE Market Capitalization was estimated at TT$120 billion (US$17.7 billion), with conglomerates and financial institutions accounting for the vast majority of value. The companies with the greatest capitalisation on the exchange are Republic Bank (RBL) and First Caribbean International Bank (FCIB). Significant capitalisation is also represented in West Indian Tobacco (WCO), Scotiabank Trinidad and Tobago (SBTT), National Enterprises Limited(NEL), ANSA McAL (AMCL), First Citizen's Bank (FIRST), National Commercial Bank of Jamaica Limited (NCBJ), Trinidad and Tobago Natural Gas Company Limited (TTNGL) and Massy Holdings (MASSY).
Clico Investment Fund (CIF), listed on the Mutual Fund Market, is a company vested with the shares of Republic Bank Limited which were held by the now collapsed CL Financial. The security consists of those shares as well as Government of Trinidad and Tobago Bonds (S&amp;P Rating: BBB+ (neg)). The company was listed in January 2013 and is a closed end mutual fund with a lifespan of approximately 20 years.
The energy sector of Trinidad and Tobago, which is the main driver of the economy and the major source of revenue for the country, is poorly represented on the TTSE, with only the minor oil company, Moraven Holdings (MOV) and National Enterprises (NEL) offering any access to the local energy market. The listing of TTNGL provided some opportunity to buy into the local energy market but significant companies such as Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago (Petrotrin) and National Petroleum Marketing Company (NP) still remain entirely owned by the state. NEL is a government holding company which holds the state owned shares of the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago, Atlantic LNG (Trinidad and Tobago), TRINGEN (ammonia production) and the National Flour Mills (NFM), which in itself is separately listed on the exchange.
Since 2019, successive Ministers of Finance have mooted the idea to have large, successful state agencies list on the TTSE. These entities include, but are not limited to Petrotrin, Hilton Trinidad and the Unit Trust Corporation. There have also been calls to have NEL divested into its individual entities and have these entities listed separately. In addition, suggestions have been made for large multinationals operating in Trinidad and Tobago to list Depository receipt to allow wider national participation in these companies. Such companies include BP (Trinidad and Tobago Ltd), and Repsol (Trinidad and Tobago Ltd). As a result of the sale of RBTT Holdings to the Royal Bank of Canada in a cash and share deal in the late 2000s, a significant number of RBC shares are held by former shareholders of RBTT Holdings, which, at the time of its delisting, was one of the widest held shares on the TTSE.
Regulation and location.
The Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange falls under the jurisdiction of the Trinidad and Tobago Securities and Exchange Commission.
The TTSE is located at the Nicholas Tower building on Independence Square in Port of Spain.

Microsoft Software Updater

Microsoft Software Updater (earlier Nokia Software Updater and Ovi Suite Software Updater) is a Windows and OS X (though the Mac version is only in Beta) based application launched in 2006, that enables customers to update and recover their mobile device firmware of a S40 or S60 or Lumia device from any Internet enabled access point. To avoid data loss users are prompted with on-screen advice on how to safely update their device.
In 2015 Microsoft Mobile offers four distinct software update applications, the Microsoft Software Updater serves primarily to update their feature phones, while the Lumia Software Recovery Tool and Windows Phone Recovery Tools are applications used to update and recover Windows Phone devices, though the Lumia Software Recovery Tool also supports Symbian and other Nokia platforms, and the Nokia Care Suite enables users to install Microsoft Mobile firmware updates for Microsoft Lumia devices. Further Microsoft Mobile offers desktop synchronisation applications which also offer updates to device components such as the Nokia Suite and its predecessor the Nokia PC Suite for legacy Nokia telephones, though the Nokia Suite also supports content migration for Microsoft Lumia devices such as messages, contacts, and device software.
All software suites except for the Windows Phone Recovery Tool were originally developed under Nokia while the Windows Phone Recovery Tool was created specifically for the Windows 10 Technical Preview for phones.
History.
The service was launched in beta in 2006, and the Nokia Software Updater's beta phase ended at 25 August 2011. Nokia Software Updater 3.0.495 was released to consumers in 2011. After acquisition of Nokia's devices and services divisions by Microsoft, the application was renamed to Microsoft Software Updater. the Microsoft Software Updater does not install any pre-release of Nokia device software, but will restore the latest updates.
The service can be used to restore the firmware on "bricked" phones which previously could only be done at local Microsoft Care customer service centres. Microsoft Care's range of software update and recovery programs also include a software recovery tool for Lumia-branded Windows Phones that don't start up or respond which may restore the latest firmware. The Recovery tool requires the telephone to have 70-80% battery charge and works only with Windows Phone 8 or higher devices.
In 2015 Microsoft used the software to update their Series 30+ based Nokia 130 devices.
Lumia Software Recovery Tool.
The "Microsoft Care" division of Microsoft Mobile had several other specialised versions of the Microsoft Software Updater. This included the Nokia Software Recovery Tool which can recover lost software and unbrick phones in a similar manner to the Microsoft Software Updater. Its primary aim is to restore lost data after failed update installation attempts. The 1.3.1 version requires Windows 7 or later and was a re-released version of the older Symbian recovery tool. As part of Microsoft's new wave of rebranding it was renamed the Lumia Software Recovery Tool. It was updated and renamed to Nokia Software Recovery Tool again in 2015. In 2016 Microsoft closed down all Nokia sites and download servers. This affected all Nokia firmware downloader softwares. In 2017 Microsoft has outsourced the old Nokia phone software service to a rather unknown company named B2X.
Windows Device Recovery Tool.
In February 2015, to coincide with the launch with the technical preview of Windows 10 Mobile, Microsoft launched a similar application for Windows Insiders known as the Windows Phone Recovery Tool. This application will remove Windows 10 from the device and restore the most current Windows Phone 8.1 software and the device's latest available firmware (i.e. Lumia Cyan or Lumia Denim).
Microsoft issued an update to the Windows Phone Recovery Tool in April 2015 to address difficulties for Nokia Lumia 520 and other low-memory devices while installing the Windows 10 technical preview, because their limited (512 MB) memory caused these devices to become "bricked". The update resolved these issues by lowering the data blocks being fed to the device from 2MB to 128kBs at a time while recovering these defective models.
On 13 May 2015 Microsoft added support for the HTC One (M8) for Windows devices in version 2.0.3 while earlier the Windows Phone Recovery Tool exclusively worked with Microsoft/Nokia Lumia devices. In September 2015 Microsoft updated the Windows Phone Recovery Tool which renamed it to the Windows Device Recovery Tool alongside several minor fixes such as improved support features, and some accessibility improvements. In November 2015 Microsoft added additional support for another non-Microsoft made Windows mobile device, the "LG Lancet".
On 30 March 2016 Microsoft added support for the Microsoft HoloLens and the Microsoft HoloLens Clicker devices which is a Windows 10-based augmented reality headset and companion device based on Windows Holographic.
Microsoft Care.
Microsoft Care (formerly Nokia Care) centres are physical locations created to deliver personalised customer support services and fix broken Lumia and Nokia-branded devices. This centres employ highly skilled engineers to repair and fix Nokia and Microsoft devices, though initially Nokia Care centres were the only place where customers could upgrade their Symbian devices prior to the launch of the Nokia Software Updater.
In rural African areas Microsoft Mobile operates Microsoft Care as a service to deliver customer support with vans by sending engineers, which can be reached via an SMS-warranty scheme.
In June 2015, Microsoft announced it will rebrand its Nokia Care centres to Microsoft Care and then Lumia Care Point Locations. It was later reported that Microsoft would close the majority of their care facilities in Poland and other European countries in favour of having more large centralised facilities as opposed to smaller ones being a part of the larger restructuring within Microsoft's mobile devices strategy based on their plan of laying off former Nokia employees.

Lordscairnie Castle

Lordscairnie Castle is a ruin situated near Moonzie, north-east of Cupar, in Fife, Scotland. It is protected as a scheduled monument.
History.
Cairnie was a property of the Lindsay family, later Earls of Crawford, from 1355. The tower was constructed around 1500 by Alexander Lindsay of Auchtermoonzie (died 1517). The second son of the 4th earl of Crawford, Alexander subsequently became 7th earl, inheriting the earldom from his nephew who was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. According to John Knox, James V of Scotland visited the castle just before his death in 1542.
James VI visited Ballinbreich Castle in June 1583 and then went on to Lordscarnie. James Stewart, Earl of Arran stayed at "Carnye, the house of Crawford" in July 1583. In September 1583, after the collapse of the Gowrie Regime, Robert Pitcairn negotiated to be released from Lochleven Castle to be held on bond at Lordscairnie.
The castle was unoccupied in the 17th century, and was used for religious meetings by an outlawed Episcopal congregation. It was later used for agricultural purposes.
Description.
It was originally an L-plan tower house with five storeys, including a barrel-vaulted basement and a garret. The stair tower is located on the north-west side, linking all floors from a ground floor entrance. The parapet and many of the dressed stones forming the window surrounds have been lost. To the north-east is a single round tower, once flanking a gate within an outer enclosure wall.
Potential restoration.
In 1997 the castle was bought by an American entrepreneur, Robert Bourne, who planned to restore it as a second home and a retreat for software developers. From 1997 to 2003 he completed a program of historical research, geophysical and archaeological exploration of the site, detailed engineering and design surveys and other pre-planning consent work under the guidance of Historic Scotland; the castle was subsequently sold to a local hotelier. It was on the market again in 2012, with an asking price in the region of £220,000. It was estimated that at least £1 million would be needed to undertake restoration.

Sobekhotep VIII

Sekhemre Seusertawy Sobekhotep VIII was an ancient Egyptian ruler during the Second Intermediate Period whose exact chronological placement remains uncertain. He may have ruled over the Theban region in Upper Egypt. Scholars debate whether he belonged to the 13th, 16th, or 17th Dynasty. If Sobekhotep VIII was a king of the 16th Dynasty, it is thought that he is listed in the Turin Canon (11:2), which credits him with a 16-year reign.
Reign.
Almost nothing is known about Sekhemre Seusertawy Sobekhotep.
Reign length. His reign length lasted to the end of Year 4 as attested by the Inundation Stele, which is his only and highest attestation. The stela was dated to the very end of Year 4 just prior to Egyptian New Year and he most likely continued to reign into his Year 5 based on this evidence. If he can be associated with Turin King List 11:2, then the list credits the ruler with 16 regnal years. However, a longer reign would suggest there would be more attestations of this ruler.
Attestation.
The Inundation Stela.
The only contemporary attestation of Sobekhotep VIII is a stela found inside the third pylon at Karnak. This stela was used as construction material to fill the pylon during Amenhotep III's extensive works at the site. The stela is dated to the epagomenal, or final five days, of Sobekhotep VIII's fourth regnal year, and describes his attitude at a temple, probably that of Karnak, during a massive Nile flood: 
According to Egyptologist John Baines, who studied the stela in detail, by coming to the temple as it was flooded, the king reenacted the Egyptian story of the creation of the world in imitating the actions of the creator god Amun-Ra, to which the stela iconography closely associates the king, ordering the waters to recede from around the primordial mount.
Non-contemporary attestations.
Karnak King List.
The Karnak King List 43 (44) mentions Sekhemre Seusertawy (sḫm-rꜤ swsr-tꜢwi). He is listed between Merkawra (42 (45)) and a lost name (44 (43)).
Turin King List.
The Turin King List does not mention Sekhemre Seusertawy. The list is heavily fragmented and many names have been lost. Some have speculated that he can be identified in Turin King List 11:2 as Sekhemre [...].
Theories.
Chronological position.
A king of the 13th Dynasty.
Egyptologists Jürgen von Beckerath and Labib Habachi considered Sobekhotep VIII to be a king of the 13th Dynasty.
A king of the 16th Dynasty.
The Turin King List (11:2) reads: "The Dual King Sekhemra ... 16 years ...". Egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker assign this entry to Sekhemre Seusertawy, which is Sobekhotep VIII's nomen. If this identification is correct, then Sobekhotep VIII reigned for 16 years as the third king of the 16th Dynasty. This would make him the direct successor of Djehuti and the predecessor to Neferhotep III, although his relation to both of these kings remains unknown. In his reconstruction of the chronology of the Second Intermediate Period, Ryholt proposes that Sobekhotep VIII reigned from 1645 BC until 1629 BC, shortly after the Hyksos 15th Dynasty took over the Nile Delta and the city of Memphis, thereby precipitating the collapse of the 13th Dynasty.

Shahin Diniyev

Shahin Khadakerim oglu Diniyev (, ; born 12 July 1966) is an Azerbaijani football manager and former midfielder who most recently coached Azerbaijan Premier League side Sabail.
Diniyev served as both captain and head coach of the Azerbaijani national team. His two sons, Karim and Coşqun, are also professional footballers, with the latter having been a senior international since 2015.
Personal life.
Shahin Khadakerim oglu Diniyev was born on July 12, 1966, in the Beylagan district. At the age of 17, he was admitted to the Azerbaijan State Academy of Physical Education and Sports.
His sons, Karim Diniyev and Coşqun Diniyev, are football players, and his nephew, Ramil Diniyev, is a former referee.
Career.
Diniyev played for clubs in his native Azerbaijan, as well as Russia, Moldova and Israel. After retirement, he became a coach, first with FK Qarabağ and then Kapaz PFC.
In November 2005, he impressed the AFFA sufficiently to be awarded with the national team job, promising to restructure the squad with an emphasis on youth and to help turn Azerbaijan into a credible force within UEFA competition. Replacing Vagif Sadygov, Diniyev's first game in charge was a friendly against Ukraine in Baku at the Tofig Bakhramov Stadium; the result was 0-0, a minor success against stronger opposition.
In further friendlies, a shock 1–1 draw against Turkey and another 0–0 draw against Moldova followed. Diniyev was soon to witness his first defeat as Azerbaijan coach: in August 2006 he watched his team succumb to a 6–0 defeat against Ukraine, this time in Kyiv. This game was the final friendly match before qualification for the 2008 UEFA European Football Championship began.
Under Diniyev, the Azerbaijan squad has given debuts to not only young players but also some naturalised foreigners, such as Leandro Gomes of FC Baku, who was born in Brazil.
In December 2022, Diniyev was appointed as the head coach of the Azerbaijan Premier League club Sabail. On November 3, 2024, he announced his resignation from the head coach position at the club.

Zale Corporation

The Zale Corporation (best known as Zales) is an American jewelry retailer, incorporated in Delaware in 1993. The principal executive offices are located in Coppell, Texas.
History.
The company began in 1924 in Wichita Falls, Texas, when the two Russian-Jewish immigrant brothers Morris (M. B.) Zale and William Zale (born Zalefsky/Zalewski), along with Ben Lipshy opened the first Zales Jewelers store (now a division in the multi-division company).
As a marketing strategy, the Zale brothers instituted a credit plan whereby customers could pay "a penny down and a dollar a week", making jewelry and other merchandise affordable for the average working American. The success of this credit policy led to the company expanding to a total of 12 stores in Oklahoma and Texas by 1941. Zales Jewelers moved its headquarters from Wichita Falls to Dallas in 1946. In 1998, online shopping was opened at www.zales.com.
Corporate restructuring.
In 1957, Zales Jewelers opened its first store in a shopping center—a major shift from operating only in downtown locations. The same year, Zales announced the initial public offering of its stock (ZLC) and began trading its public shares on the American Stock Exchange in 1958. In 1989, Zale acquired Gordon's Jewelers, which had been a major competitor. Zales bought the Skillern Drug pharmacy chain in the 1960s, but sold it in 1980.
Until 1986, Zales operated a catalog showroom called O. G. Wilson.
In 1986, People's Jewelers bought Zales.
On January 1, 1992, Zale filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
In 1999 and 2000, Zale expanded with two major acquisitions: Peoples Jewellers of Canada and Piercing Pagoda.
In 2007, the company divested its Bailey Banks &amp; Biddle brand to Finlay Enterprises.
In February 2014, Signet Jewelers agreed to buy Zale Corporation, with Zale shareholders receiving US$21 a share in cash in US$1.3 billion deal. The merger created a $6.2 billion firm.
In January 2017, Zales announced it would close a handful of its mall stores when the leases expire, to avoid duplication with former rival Kay Jewelers.
In 2018, the company moved its headquarters to a new building in Coppell, Texas.

Hreðric and Hroðmund

Hreðric and Hroðmund were the sons of the Danish king Hroðgar and his queen, Wealhþeow, in the Old English epic "Beowulf". They are only mentioned in passing, and there seems to be some foreshadowing in "Beowulf" that their cousin, Halga's son Hroðulf, i.e. Hrólfr Kraki, would usurp the throne from them.
Scandinavian tradition.
It has been suggested that Hreðric corresponds to Hrœrekr Ringslinger (aka Hrörekr, Rørik, Hrókr or Roricus) in Scandinavian tradition. However, the traditions vary and so Hrörekr is either killed by Hrólfr Kraki or his successor as the ruler of Zealand (the Danish heartland).
In Saxo Grammaticus's "Gesta Danorum" (Book 2), Hrólfr Kraki kills a Rørik: "... our king, who laid low Rorik (i.e. Rørik), the son of Bok the covetous, and wrapped the coward in death." "Rørik" is the expected Old East Norse form of "Hreðric", and personages named "Rørik", "Hrok" or similar such names can be found in most versions of the Hrólf Kraki tradition.
In the "Skjöldunga saga", Valdar disputes Hrörekr's succession of Hrólfr Kraki as the king of the Daner. After the war, Hrörekr took Zealand, while Valdar took Skåne. If based on the same tradition as "Hversu Noregr byggdist", Valdar had the right to claim the throne being the son of the former king Hróarr (Hroðgar).
Even though Hrólfr Kraki was made their guardian, their mother could have easily fled back to her Wuffing kin, as the male line of Hroðgar seemed to live on through Valdar. Valdar also took power in Scane, which makes sense as it is near Östergötland. After Ingjald's death, "Sögubrot" relates, Ivar Vidfamne gave the East Geatish throne to Hjörmund, the son of Hjörvard, since it had been the kingdom of Hjörmund's father Hjörvard. As Ivar Vidfamne was a great grandson of Hroðgar and his Wuffing wife Wealhþēow, this could be seen as a reward for loyalty as well as kinship with the Wuffings.

House of Perkūnas

The House of Perkūnas is one of the most original and Gothic secular buildings, located in the Old Town of Kaunas, Lithuania. Originally built by Hanseatic merchants and served as their office from 1440 until 1532, it was sold in the 16th century to the Jesuits who had established a chapel there in 1643. The Jesuits have also completed the Church of St. Francis Xavier at the Town Hall Square in 1722.
The ruined house was rebuilt in the 19th century and served as a school and theatre, which was attended by Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. At the end of the 19th century it was renamed the "House of Perkūnas", when a figure, interpreted by the romantic historians of that time as an idol of the Baltic pagan god of thunder and the sky Perkūnas was found in one of its walls. Today, the house of Perkūnas once again belongs to the Jesuits and houses a museum of Adam Mickiewicz.
Lithuanian historian, theologian and translator Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz was born in the house.
The House of Perkūnas was included into the Registry of Immovable Cultural Heritage Sites of the Republic of Lithuania in 1996.

Delano Ames

Delano Ames (May 29, 1906 – January 1987) was an American writer of detective stories. Ames was the author of some 20 books, many of them featuring a husband and wife detective team of amateurs named Dagobert and Jane Brown. A later series of novels involved a character named Juan Lorca, of the Spanish Civil Guard, who solved local mysteries.
Life.
Ames was born in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, the son of Benjamin and Isabel Kirk Ames. Delano's father Benjamin worked for the local newspaper, but moved the family in 1917 to New Mexico. Ames' grandfather was Columbus Delano, Secretary of the Interior under President Ulysses S. Grant. Ames attended Yale and Columbia universities.
Ames married Australian-born writer Maysie Coucher Ames (1901–1971) in Greenwich Village, New York City, in 1929. Under the pen name Maysie Greig, she was a prolific author of light-hearted romance novels. They divorced on 17 April 1937.
Ames lived in England for the next few years, where he married his second wife, Kit, and was assigned as a British intelligence officer during World War II. He also worked on anthologies on mythology and as a translator for Larousse in France. His last book was an introduction for a book of photography of Spain in 1971.
He died in Madrid, Spain, in January 1987.
Critical reception.
Ames' books were reviewed frequently in prominent publications such as the "New York Times" and "Kirkus Reviews", and were generally reviewed positively though not viewed as high art. The "New York Times" called 1949's "She Shall Have Murder" "amiable," comparing Dagobert Brown to Dorothy L. Sayers' detective Lord Peter Wimsey. Kirkus Reviews called his 1959 novel "For Old Crime's Sake" "fuzz-brained fluff for light entertainment."

Netocracy

Netocracy was a term invented by the editorial board of the American technology magazine "Wired" in the early 1990s. A portmanteau of "Internet" and "aristocracy", "netocracy" refers to a perceived global upper-class that bases its power on a technological advantage and networking skills, in comparison to what is portrayed as a bourgeoisie of a gradually diminishing importance.
The concept was later picked up and redefined by Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist for their book "Netocracy — The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism" (originally published in Swedish in 2000 as "Nätokraterna : boken om det elektroniska klassamhället", published in English by Reuters/Pearsall UK in 2002).
The netocracy concept has been compared with Richard Florida's concept of the creative class. Bard and Söderqvist have also defined an underclass in opposition to the netocracy, which they refer to as the consumtariat.
The consumtariat.
Alexander Bard describes a new underclass called the consumtariat, a portmanteau of consumer and proletariat, whose main activity is consumption, regulated from above. It is kept occupied with private problems, its desires provoked with the use of advertisements and its active participation is limited to things like product choice, product customization, engaging with interactive products and life-style choice.
Cyberdeutocracy.
Similar to netocracy, is the concept of cyberdeutocracy. Karl W. Deutsch in his book "The Nerves of Government: Models of Political Communication and Control" hypothesized about "information elites, controlling means of mass communication and, accordingly, power institutions, the functioning of which is based on the use of information in their activities." Thus Deutsch introduced the concept of deutocracy, combining the words 'Deutsch' and 'autocracy' to get the new term. Cyberdeutocracy combines 'deutocracy' with the prefix 'cyber-' and is defined as a political regime based on the control by the political and corporate elites of the information and communication infrastructure of the Internet space. As a tool of social control, Cyberdeutocracy allows elites to engage in the:
The term was coined by Phillip Freiberg in his 2018 paper "What are CyberSimulacra and Cyberdeutocracy?"
Other usages.
Netocracy can also refer to "Internet-enabled democracy" where issue-based politics will supersede party-based politics. In this sense, the word "netocracy" is also used as a portmanteau of "Internet" and "democracy", not of "Internet" and "aristocracy":

Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?

Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie? (1969) was written by Don Petersen and premiered at the Belasco Theatre in New York. It helped to launch the careers of actors Al Pacino, Roger Robinson and Ron Thompson.
Title.
The character Fullendorf says, "Does a tiger wear a necktie? It ain't for us to go straight. We're like the tigers. We always chucked on raw meat. We was raised on it, and we like it."
"Does a tiger wear a necktie? No, it would be against his nature – and reform is against the nature of addicts like Bickham", Clive Barnes explained in his "New York Times" review.
Plot.
The story is a racially charged drama about teen drug addicts at a rehabilitation center, located on an island in a river bordering a large industrial city.
An English teacher tries to make a difference in his students' lives. He encounters barriers in trying to do this—the same barriers created by the system that hinders the addicts' development and keeps them coming back.
One addict, Bickham, is a tough white teenager who searched for his father and found him working in a seedy barber shop. Upon meeting his son, the barber shows him a dirty photograph.
Contrasting Bickham is Conrad, an African-American addict. Conrad wants to recover and marry his love Linda. During the play, his character leaves the rehabilitation group to live with his sister, who is also an addict.
Aside from the students, there are only four characters in the rehabilitation center – a teacher, a psychiatrist, a policeman, and the center's principal.
Production.
"Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?" was directed by Michael Schultz in his Broadway debut after years of professional work with the Negro Ensemble Company, and was produced by Huntington Hartford, an heir to the A&amp;P supermarket empire.
The original 1969 production was at the Belasco Theatre. It had nine previews and thirty-nine performances.
The play enjoyed a 2002 revival at the Looking Glass Theatre in New York, where it was directed by Michael LoPorto. It is a regular on the community and school theater circuit and in acting classes.
Cast.
The play helped launch the career of Al Pacino, who won a Tony Award for Best Dramatic Actor in a Supporting Role for his portrayal of Bickham. Jack Kroll in "Newsweek" wrote that Pacino had "the choreography of a hood, with a poetic soul."
A poll by "Variety" of drama critics named Pacino the "most promising new Broadway actor" for his performance.
Hal Holbrook played Mr. Winters, the teacher who cared enough to reach his students. Lauren Jones received a 1969 Tony nomination for playing Linda. Michael Brandon played Prince, and Conrad was portrayed by Roger Robinson.
Actor Ron Thompson later won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for his 1973 theater lead performance in "Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?"
Impact.
The play portrays addicts as the victims of loveless upbringings. They fail in isolation or find strength in love.
The play, however, was characterized as more of a documentary about the lives of addicts and our rehabilitation system. It does not provide morality or solutions. It leaves judgment to the audience.

Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Scott Yanow wrote that "...even if the results are not all that unique, her voice is often in near-miraculous form. ...Sassy sounds in prime form, on such songs as 'I Didn't Know What Time It Was', 'Autumn Leaves', 'The Island' and 'You Are Too Beautiful'. It is hard to believe, listening to her still-powerful voice on this CD reissue, that she had already been a recording artist for 40 years". "The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings" considers the album to be possibly Vaughan’s best for the Pablo label.

Shūmei

Shūmei (, "name succession") are grand naming ceremonies held in kabuki theatre. Most often, a number of actors will participate in a single ceremony, taking on new stage names. 
These stage names, most often those of the actor's father, grandfather, or teacher, are passed down between generations of actors' lineages, and hold great honor and importance. Many names are associated with certain roles or acting styles, and the new possessor of each name must live up to these expectations; there is the feeling almost of the actor not only taking a name, but embodying the spirit, style, or skill of each actor who previously had that name. Many actors will go through at least three names over the course of their career, their participation in a "shūmei" representing their passage into a new chapter of their performing career.
The "shūmei" usually is followed by a performance significant to the actors' new names; these might involve larger parts, a new play, or roles traditional for actors with those names. For example, the stage name of Ichikawa Danjūrō is strongly associated with the role of the hero in the "Shibaraku" scene. Many of the thirteen men to be called Ichikawa Danjūrō excelled at this role, and so upon becoming the next Ichikawa Danjūrō, an actor may perform that role, which he never would have as a younger, less experienced actor with a different stage name.

Brendan Cummins (GAA player)

Brendan Cummins (born 11 May 1975) is an Irish hurler and hurling coach who played as a goalkeeper for the Tipperary senior team.
Born in Ardfinnan, County Tipperary, Cummins arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Tipperary minor football team, before later joining the minor hurling team and the under-21 sides in both codes. He made his senior hurling debut in the 1993-94 National Hurling League. Cummins went on to play a key role as goalkeeper for twenty years, and won two All-Ireland medals, five Munster medals and three National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions.
Cummins represented the Munster inter-provincial team at various times throughout his career, winning two Railway Cup medals in 2000 and as captain in 2001. At club level, he plays hurling with Ballybacon–Grange and football with sister club Ardfinnan.
Throughout his hurling career Cummins made at the time a record 73 championship appearances for Tipperary. He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 17 October 2013.
His father, John Cummins, enjoyed a lengthy career as a Gaelic footballer and as a coach at various levels with Tipperary.
Cummins is widely regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the game. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, and collected five All-Star awards during his career.
In March 2015, Cummins was featured on the TG4 documentary series "Laochra Gael".
Cummins released his autobiography called "Standing My Ground" in October 2015.
Biography.
Brendan Cummins was born in Ardfinnan, County Tipperary in 1975. He was born into a family that had a strong association with Gaelic games, particularly Gaelic football. His father, John Cummins, played football with Tipperary in the 1960s and also featured on the Munster inter-provincial team.
Cummins was educated at the local national school in the village, before later receiving his secondary schooling in nearby Cahir. He currently works as a bank official with the Allied Irish Bank and is based in Cahir.
Playing career.
Club.
Cummins plays his club hurling with Ballybacon–Grange and Gaelic football with sister club Ardfinnan.
In 1998, Cummins was goalkeeper on the Ballybacon–Grange team that captured the South Tipperary intermediate championship. It was the first of four divisional titles in-a-row for Cummins and his club.
After failing to secure a fifth successive divisional championship, Ballybacon–Grange returned in 2003 to claim the South Tipp title once again. It was the first of two-in-a-row for Cummins and his team.
Cummins won a seventh South Tipp intermediate championship medal in 2007.
After an absence of five years Ballybacon–Grange were back in the divisional decider once again in 2012. Cummins registered 1–1 in that game to give Ballybacon a 1–13 to 0–11 victory over St. Mary's. It was an eighth divisional medal for Cummins.
Minor and under-21.
Cummins first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a dual player in the respective minor grades.
He won a Munster medal as goalkeeper with the Tipperary minor hurling team in 1993 following a 1–12 to 1–9 defeat of Cork. Tipperary were subsequently defeated by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final.
Two years later in 1995 Cummins had joined the Tipp under-21 team. That year he won a Munster medal in that grade following a 1–17 to 0–14 defeat of Clare. Tipp later reached the All-Ireland decider where Kilkenny, the reigning champions, were the opponents. A 1–14 to 1–10 victory gave Tipp the title and gave Cummins his first All-Ireland medal in any grade.
Senior.
Cummins became a dual player at senior level in 1993. He made his debut with the Tipperary hurlers in a one-point National Hurling League victory over Waterford on 14 November 1993. His first silverware in the top flight came in April 1994, when the Tipperary senior football team won the delayed final of the McGrath Cup.
The retirement of Ken Hogan as first-choice goalkeeper on the Tipp senior hurling team in 1993 meant that the door was now open for a new player to join the starting fifteen. Cummins, who was just out of the minor grade, was overlooked as the position of custodian for the 1994 championship went to Jody Grace.
Cummins made his championship debut in Tipperary's opening championship game in 1995.
In 1997, Tipperary were narrowly defeated by Clare in the provincial decider. Clare subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland decider, however, due to the introduction of the "back-door" system Tipperary provided the opposition in the first all-Munster All-Ireland final. The game itself was one of the best of the decade. Clare were well on top for much of the game, however, Liam Cahill and Eugene O'Neill scored twice for Tipp in the last ten minutes. John Leahy missed a goal chance in the last minute while another Tipp point was controversially ruled wide. At the full-time whistle Clare won by a single point – 0–20 to 2–13.
In early 1999, Tipperary seemed to put down a benchmark for the championship when the team reached the final of the National League. In a repeat of the 1996 decider, Galway were the opposition. This time the result was reversed with Tipperary taking a 1–14 to 1–10 victory. It was Cummins's first National Hurling League medal.
In spite of a lack of championship success, Cummins was recognised as the top goalkeeper of the year in 2000 and duly collected his first All-Star award.
In 2001, Cummins lined out in a third successive National League final. Clare were the opponents in that game, however, the great Clare team of the 1990s was now heading over-the-hill. Tipperary were the victors by 1–19 to 0–17, giving Cummins a second National League medal inside three years. Tipp later qualified for a Munster final meeting with Limerick. A 2–16 to 1–17 victory gave Cummins his first Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Tipperary against old rivals Galway. Mark O'Leary scored two goals to give Tipperary a reasonably comfortable cushion, just enough to withstand a Galway comeback. Fergal Healy hit the post twice, however, his goal, Galway's second, cut the deficit to one point with just nine minutes left in the game. Tipp outscored Galway during that period to secure a 2–18 to 2–15 victory. It was Cummins's first All-Ireland medal and Tipp's first championship in a decade. He was later honoured by claiming a second All-Star award as goalkeeper.
Tipperary hurling went into decline following this win, however, Cummins won a third All-Star award in 2003.
After losing back-to-back Munster finals to Cork in 2005 and 2006, worse was to follow for Cummins in 2007. Following Tipp's drawn game with Limerick in the opening round of the championship, Cummins was sensationally dropped by manager Babs Keating in favour of his understudy Gerry Kennedy. Cummins remained sidelined for all subsequent games, and saw Tipp exit the championship with a defeat by Wexford in the All-Ireland quarter-final.
Speaking in 2013 about being dropped in 2007, Cummins said "2007 was certainly a challenge but I’d always preached that the team was the most important thing, now it was my turn to practise what I was preaching, my main focus was Gerry Kennedy — he was a young fella caught in the middle of a storm. I wanted Tipp to beat Limerick and what I’d normally do with a young fella is make sure he was ready for the game, for the rest of the year, I just trained harder. Then I got a lucky break in a lot of ways when Liam Sheedy came in and offered me a second chance."
Cummins was reinstated as first-choice goalkeeper under new manager Liam Sheedy in 2008. Tipperary announced their return to the big time in 2008 by remaining undefeated in the National League before meeting Galway in the final. In an exciting game Tipp emerged victorious by 3–18 to 3-16 and Cummins collected his third National League medal on the field of play. Tipperary later qualified for the Munster final where they defeated a resurgent Clare team by 2–21 to 0–19. Cummins collected his second Munster medal that day, however, Tipperary were subsequently defeated in a tense All-Ireland semi-final by Waterford on a scoreline of 1–20 to 1–18. Cummins was once again presented with an All-Star award.
In 2009, Cummins won his third Munster medal as Tipp defeated Waterford by 4–14 to 2–16. After a six-week lay-off and a facile semi-final win over Limerick, Tipperary qualified for an All-Ireland final meeting with Kilkenny. For much of the match it looked as if Tipp would pull off a shock and deny 'the Cats' a record-equaling four-in-a-row. Two quick goals in the space of a minute, one from a penalty by Henry Shefflin, sealed a 2–22 to 0–23 victory and defeat for Tipperary.
After surrendering their Munster title to Cork, Tipperary regrouped in the qualifiers and reached a second successive All-Ireland decider. Kilkenny, a team chasing a fifth successive championship, provided the opposition and a great game was expected. Tipperary got off to a great start which was bolstered by an early Lar Corbett goal. He subsequently completed a hat-trick of goals and Tipperary had a fourth by Noel McGrath to deny Kilkenny's drive-for-five and secure a remarkable and convincing 4–17 to 1–18 victory. It was Cummins's second All-Ireland medal. He finished off the season with a fifth All-Star award.
Tipperary returned as provincial kingpins once again in 2011. A 7–19 to 0-19 trouncing of Waterford in the southern decider gave Cummins a fourth Munster medal. For the third successive year, Tipperary faced off against Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final, however, on this occasion Kilkenny were slight underdogs going up against the new champions. Kilkenny started quickly and never surrendered the lead in the 2–17 to 1–16 victory.
In spite of an indifferent National League campaign, Tipperary were regarded as potential All-Ireland champions once again. A 2–17 to 0–16 defeat of Waterford in the provincial decider gave Cummins a fifth Munster medal. Tipperary later faced a humiliating 4–24 to 1–15 defeat by eventual champions Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final.
In 2013, Cummins started his 19th competitive season in the Tipperary goalkeeper's jersey under new manager Eamon O'Shea.
On 17 October 2013, Cummins announced his retirement from inter-county hurling.
He admitted that it was time to move on and spend more time with his family and that the 2013 would be his final year. His final game was against Kilkenny at Nowlan Park on 6 July 2013 in phase 2 of the All-Ireland Qualifiers, a game which Tipperary lost by 1–14 to 0-20. Speaking about the game he said "It was probably the most emotional I'd been after a game, when the full-time whistle blew that day, I fell to my knees, I’d like to say thanks for the support from my family, the support from Tipperary fans and from the club."
He kept 22 clean sheets during his championship career of 73 matches.
Inter-provincial.
Cummins has also lined out regularly with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling championship. He first played for his province in 1996 as Munster trounced Ulster by 5–13 to 0–7 in the semi-final. Cummins was replaced by Davy FitzGerald for the final which Munster won.
Cummins was the first-choice goalkeeper for Munster between 1999 and 2004, a period which saw some success on the inter-provincial front. Munster reached the final of the competition in 2000. Arch-rivals Leinster provided the opposition and a close game developed between the provinces finest. Munster just about sneaked a 3–15 to 2–15 win, giving Cummins a Railway Cup winners’ medal.
In 2001, Cummins was honoured by being appointed captain of his province for the series of games. After a defeat of Leinster he led his team out for the final against Connacht. Munster had a rather flattering 1–21 to 1–15 victory, however, Cummins had the distinction of lifting the Railway Cup on behalf of his province while also collecting a second consecutive winners’ medal.
In total, Cummins was part of the Munster hurling panel in the Inter-Provincial competition in 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, and 2013 winning 4 medals in 1996, 2000, 2001 (as captain), and in 2013.
Poc Fada.
Cummins has also enjoyed success in the famous Poc Fada competition held annually in the Cooley Mountains. After winning the pairs competition with Ian Scallan from Wexford in 1999, Cummins later went on to win nine singles titles between 2004 and 2015.
Coaching career.
In January 2014, Cummins was unveiled as the new goalkeeping coach for the Kerry hurling team, working under Tipperary native Eamonn Kelly . However, for Kerry's 2020 Joe McDonagh Cup Semi-Final match against Carlow, Cummins failed to show up, opting instead to commentate on the Senior Hurling Quarter-Final between his native Tipperary, and Galway, in which Tipperary were beaten.
On 8 September 2021, Cummins was announced as the new manager of the Tipperary under-20 hurling team on a three-year term.
On 31 May 2025, Tipperary won the 2025 All-Ireland Under-20 Hurling Championship after a 3-19 to 1-16 win against Kilkenny in the final.
Media career.
Cummins has been a guest panelist on various GAA programmes during his playing career. In May 2014, it was announced that Cummins would join RTÉ's team of GAA analysts on radio and television, starting with the 2014 championships.
He has also written articles for the official GAA website in 2014, the "Irish Independent" and other sports websites.

Legacy of the Ancients

Legacy of the Ancients is a fantasy role-playing video game published by Electronic Arts in 1987.
Gameplay.
The player takes on the role of a young shepherd who finds and loots a recently dead body while on a first trip to the city, taking a black disk, a bracelet, and a leather scroll. The Galactic Museum mysteriously appears to the player after collecting these items. The player learns that by taking these items, he has become the next in a line of adventurers attempting to destroy the Wizard's Compendium, the leather scroll the player picked up.
The museum has various display cases that require the insertion of special coins of various types to access. Some coins can be bought in random encounters with NPCs, some can be found as loot after combat, and some coins can only be found at the bottom level of various dungeons, meaning the player cannot proceed beyond a certain point until that dungeon is finished.
Unlike many RPGs, the game does not use an experience point system. The player gains levels only through the successful completion of various quests.
The game is mostly in top-down style for the world maps, towns, and castles, but switches to a 3D style in the dungeons and in the museum.
Several different areas of the game, like games in towns and certain museum displays, allow the character to play in special mini-games, which, if done successfully, will permanently increase attributes. Also, various casinos about the towns let players gamble to win money. It is also possible to rob banks in cities, but this attracts the attention of the town guards, who will remember the robbery until the player enters another town.
Copy protection.
The game makes use of a code wheel copy protection that requires the player to match a gemstone and the name of a world on which another branch of the Galactic Museum exists. The player then has to enter a six-digit number to proceed. One of the worlds on the disk, Bantross, became the setting for the sequel, "The Legend of Blacksilver".
Another part of the copy protection involves an attempt by the program to modify the program disk itself on startup and render it unusable. On authentic game disks, this operation fails since the disks are write-protected. When playing the game using an emulator, it is advisable to set the read-only attribute for each disk image to avoid this modification.
Development.
"Legacy of the Ancients" shares a similar design to "Questron". Although not a sequel, it uses an updated engine shared by "Questron" and "Questron II", and the same developers worked on the games.
Reception.
"Computer Gaming World" in 1987 described "Legacy of the Ancients" as "an advancement by the design team that created "Questron"", with "more lavish use of color than its predecessor". The magazine's Scorpia in 1988 enjoyed the museum setting of the game, but noted there was very little interacting with the world. The game's difficulty was described as "suitable for beginner and intermediate-level play". In 1993 she called the game "a hack'n'slash of moderate interest".
The game was reviewed in 1988 in "Dragon" #131 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 3½ stars.

It Corresponds to the Tlaxcalans coming from the center of the country to facilitate the colonization and the founding of towns like that of San Miguel de Aguayo of the New Tlaxcala, today Bustamante; The Real of San Pedro de Boca de Leones, today Villaldama; The Real of Santiago of the Sabinas, today Sabinas Hidalgo; And the Mission of Our Lady of Sorrows of the Point of Lampazas of Naranjo.
In 1690 was founded the Real San Pedro de Boca de Leones by Captain Juan de Villarreal, Francisco de Bobarbarigoo and Tlaxcala Antonio Gonzalez who discovered the first mines in the Valley of Boca de Leones. 
By consolidating the triumph of independence changed the political life of the country and what was the new Kingdom of León was called the State of Nuevo León. The Real went to the political category of Villa on 17 March 1828. In 1830 of new account the Old Mines were exploited by Don Darío Guerrero, from where he obtained the silver he gave to frame the painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe in the temple of the same name. 
The armed Struggle of 1910, barely lasted six months, which is why mining worked normally. Between The years 1914 and 1918 in the Hacienda of Guadalupe were built four vertical kilns and three of rotation, in Old Mines a vertical oven was installed. The mining production was silver and zinc. Minas Viejas is located in the Sierra of the same name. During The revolutionary movement, a bout was recorded, which is remembered for being very bloody, on 3 May 1913. The revolutionary troops were in command of the Lord Jesus Carranza, who triumphed over the federal troops under the command of Colonel Villanueva.
Currently the Rancho Minas Viejas is owned by Don Pedro Elizaldi Cantu, who worked as a miner in these properties more than 40 years ago, and who 20 years ago was one of the mayors of Lampazas de Naranjo, Nuevo León.

Gastronomy.
The Municipality of Villaldama is famous for the number of good bakeries it has had throughout its history. Throughout the municipality they find a wide variety of bakeries, which still use traditional stone ovens, where you can buy empanadas (pumpkin, pineapple, caramel, among others), volcanoes, Coyotas, hojarascas, among other pieces of bread.
Popular Fiestas.
Feria de la Santa Cruz: 26 April through 3 May.
Illustrious Characters.
Of Villaldama are originating some illustrious personages, like the baseball player: Epitacio "La Mala " Torres and the lawyer and former Senator of the Republic: Angel Santos Cervantes, among others. 
David Carrillo González, (Villaldama, Nuevo León 29 October 1920, State of Mexico, 16 December 2015.). Dean of the Mexican caricature, he has been President and Founding Partner of the Mexican Society of Caricaturists; Thanks to his vision the Museum of the Caricature is created and a showcase contains his work and personal objects. The Founders ' Hall bears its name. His work has been disseminated in newspapers of greater circulation such as Universal, Excelsior and the Sun of Mexico. In Television He worked in Duel of Cartoonists, alternating with Cabral, Freyre and Isaac. He Has exhibited throughout the Mexican Republic and in cities in the United States. He'S Got eight books published. In 1939 he made his first cover in Magazines Magazine; Then he collaborated in the newspapers The Universal Illustrated and The Afternoon where he began as a political caricaturist. In 1945 Carrillo paints a large format box commissioned by the Pan American Legion, in which he captured among others the figures of George Washington, José Martí, Hidalgo, Morelos, Juárez, Chian-Kai-Chek, De Gaulle, Manuel Ávila, Camacho, Roosevelt, etc. This work was titled "Continental Fraternity" was given to then President Roosevelt, by the Government of Mexico and the Pan American Legion.
Carrillo's caricature uses the drawing to dialogue through a benevolent and scathing language, accessible to all. The satire and parody of Carrillo's political caricatures have contributed to a more critical and detailed look at the historical episodes of national life.
Main Population Centers.
The municipality of Villaldama has 43 population centers, the principal ones being:

Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario

The Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (IPC; ) was established as an officer of the Legislature by Ontario's "Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act" (FIPPA), which came into effect on January 1, 1988. The current commissioner is Patricia Kosseim.
Mandate.
The commissioner is appointed by and reports to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and is independent of the government of the day. The function of the office is to uphold and promote open government and the protection of personal privacy in Ontario. The IPC also has responsibility for the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (MFIPPA) and the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 (PHIPA).
Together, these three Acts establish rules about how the institutions covered may collect, use, and disclose personal data. They also establish a right of access that enables individuals to request their own personal information and have it corrected if necessary.
The term "freedom of information" refers to public access to general records relating to the activities of government. This ranges from administration and operations to legislation and policy. It is an important aspect of open and accountable government. Privacy protection is the other side of that equation, and refers to the safeguarding of personal information held by government.
Under the three acts and statutory mandate, the IPC is responsible for:
History.
Following the passage of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the IPC office was created with three staff under the first Commissioner, Sidney B. Linden.
FIPPA applies to all provincial ministries and most provincial agencies, boards and commissions, as well as to universities and colleges of applied arts and technology.
Hospitals were brought under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act in January, 2012 to ensure greater transparency and accountability. Like other institutions covered by FIPPA, hospitals are required to make an annual report to the IPC.
MFIPPA broadened the number of public institutions covered by Ontario’s freedom of information and privacy legislation. It covers local government organizations, such as municipalities, police, library, health and school boards, and transit commissions.
After years of advocacy, a Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) was enacted in 2004. This health privacy law applied to all individuals and organizations involved in the delivery of health care services – both public and private sectors – to ensure the protection of personal health information of patients. In the first seven years after its enactment, IPC issued only 11 health Orders.
In accordance with the Acts, the Commissioner has delegated some decision-making powers to staff members. Thus, the Assistant Commissioner (Privacy), Assistant Commissioner (Access) and other designated staff may issue orders, resolve appeals, and investigate privacy complaints.

Monument to Vasil Levski, Sofia

The Monument to Vasil Levski (, "Pametnik na Vasil Levski") in the centre of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, is one of the first monuments to be built in the then newly liberated Principality of Bulgaria. It commemorates the hanging of Bulgarian national hero and major revolutionary figure Vasil Levski on the same spot on 18 February 1873.
The monument is 13 m high, made of grey Balkan granite and designed by Czech architect Antonín Kolář. The bronze bas-relief of the head of Levski, part of the monument, was created by Josef Strachovský (or, according to other sources, Austrian sculptor Rudolf Weyr), whereas Italian Abramo Peruchelli did the stonecutting work. It was inaugurated on 22 October 1895, but was planned and worked on ever since the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, the construction being hindered by a chronic lack of funds and negligence, and taking a whole 17 years. This ignited a wave of indignation among the Bulgarian intellectuals of the time, with the poet Konstantin Velichkov even branding this carelessness in an 1881 poem (see text).
A draft for the monument featured a large Christian cross over a crescent, but it was rejected as religiously intolerant and incompatible with Levski's proper beliefs in equality and tolerance.

Amphilochius of Pochayiv

Amphilochius of Pochayiv () was a 20th-century Ukrainian Orthodox saint from Ternopil Oblast of western Ukraine.
Early years.
Amphilochius of Pochaiv was born Yakov Varnavovich Golovatyuk on 27 November 1894 in the village of Mala Ilovytsia (Mala Ilowica in Polish), in Kremenets Raion of Ternopil Oblast in western Ukraine, at that time part of Austria-Hungary. The village of Mala Ilovytsia is located in the Ilovetska valley, which is wide, and is surrounded by the Kremenets mountains. It is the northernmost village of Ternopil Oblast, off the main roads and surrounded by forested areas.
Yakov was one of 10 children. His father, Varnava, was an able craftsman, making shoe lasts and sleighs, and had a reputation as a skilled bone setter. Yakov often assisted his father in caring for people who came for help.
In 1912 he was drafted into the army of the Tsar. During the First World War he served in Lutsk and then in Tomsk, where he was a medical attendant at the hospital. Later he was posted to the front as a field medic. He was captured as a prisoner of war by the Austrians, and sent to the Alps, where for three years he worked for a farmer. Eventually he managed to flee.
Joining Pochaiv Lavra.
Having returned home, he intended to marry but his experiences during the war, drew him to religious life and the Pochaiv monastery. Yakiv went to the Uspens’ka (Dormition) Lavra in Pochaiv in 1925. He constructed sleighs and wheels, and sang in the choir, always in the spirit of humility and obedience. On 8 July 1932 he was tonsured a monk through "postryh" (clipping of hair ceremony) and took the name Joseph (Yosyp in Ukrainian). On 27 September 1936, he was ordained a hieromonk.
Amphilochius spent much time praying in front of the miraculous icons of Pochaiv. He was appointed the caretaker of the God's Mother's Foot. God's Mother's Foot is a rock footprint left after apparition of Virgin Mary in Pochaiv around 1240.
His earlier work with his father and experience as a medic during the war gave him some skill in healing, and many people came to the Lavra seeking his help. The Archimandrite Abbot of the monastery of the lavra blessed Hieromonk Joseph in this work and allowed him to settle in a small house near the cemetery of the monastery, so as not to disturb the other monks. There the venerable Amphilochius spent 20 years ministering to the sick. He was credited with the gift of healing.
The Soviet regime which seized power after the war wished to stem the constant stream of people seeking healing from the pious monk. Fr. Joseph resisted their attempts to close the Lavra, and was subsequently incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital where he was injected with drugs. Eventually, he was released through he good offices of Svetlana Alliluyeva, whom he had previously met. Upon his release the authorities forbade him to return to the Lavra and so he settled in his native Ilovytsia with his nephew, where for many years he continued to serve the people, frequently conducting a Moleben with the Blessing of the Waters in his yard. It was believed that God gifted him with the grace of prophecy and the performing of miracles.
One day, at the instigation of the local authorities, he was severely beaten and left in an icy swamp. When found, he was taken to the lavra, where, as they thought that he was dying, he was tonsured into the Great Schema and given the name Amphilochius, in honor of Holy Hierarch Amphilochius of Iconium. Amphilochius slowly recovered. As he did not have a residence permit to stay at the Lavra, he returned to the village and resumed his ministry of healing.
He died on 1 January 1971 at the age of seventy-six. On 23 April 2002, Pochaev Elder Schema-abbot Amphilochius was glorified as a saint.

Blank Park Zoo

Blank Park Zoo is a 49-acre zoological park on the south side of Des Moines, Iowa, United States, near historic Fort Des Moines. The zoo is a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).
History.
In 1963, Abraham Harry Blank donated $150,000 for the construction of a children's zoo on decommissioned Fort Des Moines property. The Des Moines Children’s Zoo was officially opened on May 8, 1966. It was originally designed around nursery rhymes and included a castle with moat, replica of Noah's Ark, petting zoo and miniature railroad.
Over the next 16 years the city failed to make improvements to the zoo, and it was on the verge of closing until in 1981 a group of civic-minded business leaders formed the Blank Park Zoo Foundation to help save the zoo. The foundation's number-one goal was to provide financial support for capital improvements, animal acquisitions and promotional and marketing activities.
The foundation succeeded by forming a partnership with the City of Des Moines that resulted in a $1.8 million bond referendum, as well as an additional $1.4 million from the community. At the end of 1982 the zoo closed for some much needed renovations.
On May 17, 1986 the zoo reopened, featuring geographic themed exhibits with spacious, naturally landscaped environments. In 1987 the zoo was accredited by the AZA.
In 1995 the Blank Park Zoo Foundation purchased of additional historic Fort Des Moines property and nine historic buildings for future growth and expansion of the zoo. It also began a capital campaign to build a new great cats exhibit and a indoor Discovery Center exhibit.
On May 1, 1999 the Tom and Jo Ghrist Great Cats exhibit opened, and on September 1, 2001, the Blank Park Zoo opened the Myron &amp; Jackie Blank Discovery Center. On July 1, 2003 the Blank Park Zoo Foundation and City of Des Moines completed a new 28E agreement to transfer the operations and management of the zoo to the foundation. Terry Rich was hired as the zoo's first-ever chief executive officer, marking a new era in zoo history. Initial Spring Break and Holiday Safaris were introduced with much success.
In 2011, new signage and interactives were installed in the Great Cats kiosks, the David Kruidenier Australia Adventure opened featuring the endangered cassowary, the sea lion pool was rebuilt, and a special dinosaur exhibit was open all summer in the Zoo Plex.
The "Big Dig" event was held at Blank Park Zoo to generate excitement about expansion, with 8,000 in attendance.
Behind the scenes a new quarantine facility was constructed to help animal management, and a new veterinarian agreement with Iowa State University was signed.
Major exhibits.
The Blank Park Zoo contains a variety of wildlife in various exhibits.
Myron and Jackie Blank Discovery Center.
The Discovery Center is an entirely enclosed area visitors encounter first when entering the zoo, and contains various species of plants and animals. The Discovery Center contains separate sections to create a unique viewing experience:
Meredith Alpine Exhibit.
Visitors can find the Meredith Alpine Exhibit at the entrance of the Discovery Center, accessible through the zoo's main visitor lobby. Here, visitors can view the zoo's pair of red pandas from an indoor enclosure with attached travel tunnel, allowing the animals additional space in an outdoor exhibit.
The Cave.
The Cave immediately follows the Meredith Alpine Exhibit and contains most of the zoo's nocturnal animals, alongside a few enclosed reptile exhibits including:
Free Range Tropical Aviary.
home to tropical forest-dwelling birds such as the pink pigeon, mountain peacock-pheasant, ringed teal, silver-eared mesia, scarlet-chested parrot, pheasant pigeon, Gouldian finch, sunbittern, common emerald dove, Victoria crowned pigeon, speckled mousebird, and mountain bamboo partridge. Some enclosed exhibits are home to Green Iguana and golden-headed lion tamarins.
Aquarium of the Discovery Center.
The Aquarium of the Discovery Center includes aquatic environments from all around the world. A waterfall feature can be seen above the Amazon River Pool. The pool includes tropical river fish such as tambaqui (Pacu), redtail catfish, and silver arowana. The coral reef exhibit is home to species of aquatic life from coral reefs around the world including coral, sea anemone, clown triggerfish, foureye butterflyfish, clownfish, schooling bannerfish, yellow tang, and Achilles tang.
Jaama Kwa: Connection to Africa.
Opened in spring 2013 at a cost of $4.1 million, the zoo welcomed its new expansion of the existing African Boardwalk on the east side of the park. The expansion brought multiple new species to the zoo, including a pair of the Eastern black rhinoceros, common eland, common ostrich, kori bustard, blue wildebeest, African spurred tortoise, an okapi, nyala, and two red river hogs.
Prior to the expansion, the zoo held a smaller collection of African species, including Reticulated giraffe, Hartmann's mountain zebra, addax, rhim gazelle, grey crowned cranes, and helmeted guineafowl. All still reside at the zoo on the renovated boardwalk adjacent to the newly constructed area.
After coming to the zoo in 2012 based on a Species Survival Plan (SSP) recommendation, the zoo's eastern black rhinos Ayana and Kiano welcomed their first calf, female Tumani in 2016. In 2019, a second rhino birth was announced from the same pair. A name contest was conducted by the public with the calf officially being named Kamara in the months following.
David Kruidenier Australia Adventure.
Completed in July 2011, this Australian-themed section of the zoo brings visitors into the great Australian outback, which includes an Australian-themed barn, and many animals including double-wattled cassowary, laughing kookaburra, red-necked wallaby, and common peafowl. A specially designed aviary can also be found within this exhibit, homed to the rainbow lorikeet.
Kids' Kingdom.
In late June 2007, the zoo, the Greater Des Moines Leadership Institute, and hundreds of volunteers from around Des Moines built the Kids' Kingdom playground. It includes of slides, mazes, monkey bars, sand pits, fossil digs, and mining sluice. This area features many "contact animals" that visitors can feed. Animals in this area include Nigerian dwarf goats, llamas, miniature donkeys, zebu, Meishan pigs, Brahma chickens, koi fish, trumpeter swans, and dromedary camels.
Tom and Jo Ghrist Big Cat Complex.
The cat exhibit opened in 1999 with snow leopards, Amur tigers, and African lions. Recently, this exhibit got a facelift with new interactive displays and new viewing area rocks.
Hub Harbor Pinniped Pavilion.
The new seal/sea lion pool opened on March 17, 2012 after a year of reconstruction to the old pool. The exhibit now features two high-rise viewing areas, as well as an underwater viewing area for the zoo's California sea lions and harbor seals.
Notable residents of the pavilion include Ross and Meru, two harbor seals that came to the Blank Park Zoo from British Columbia. They were rescued off the coast of Canada when they were just five days old, severely malnourished and dehydrated. The Vancouver Marine Mammal Rescue Center nursed them back to health. After examination, the center declared that they were non-releasable due to health disabilities. They found a permanent home at the zoo after the reconstruction of Hub Harbor, where they now reside.
The exhibit welcomed its newest resident, a young sea lion named Meatball, in spring 2020 from the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in California.
Miscellaneous animal exhibits.
In addition to animals in the major exhibits, the zoo includes many individual exhibits that are home to animals including:
Conservation initiatives.
Starting in 1997, the Blank Park Zoo Conservation Committee has raised funds for a wide variety of worldwide conservation projects. The primary projects of the committee must be international, focus on protecting animals or their natural ecosystems, and have some tie to the Blank Park Zoo. Money is collected through various means such as children's face painting, special event raffles, and coin donation buckets.
In 2012, the Conservation Committee participated in these projects: 
Incidents.
In August 2019, a 12 year-old male okapi named Kidomo brought to Des Moines from the Oklahoma City Zoo was humanely euthanized after sustaining injuries in an incident with his exhibit mate, an 11 year-old nyala named Cloud. Based on initial information, Blank Park Zoo CEO Mark Vukovich stated, "the two animals were playing together and unfortunately the okapi was injured".
In April 2020, Blank Park Zoo announced the death of 3 year-old Duchess, a female Hartmann's mountain zebra, that died following an accidental high-speed run-in with a fence post. Duchess and her mate Duke had arrived at the zoo a year prior from another AZA-accredited institution.

Rokhlin's theorem

In 4-dimensional topology, a branch of mathematics, Rokhlin's theorem states that if a smooth, orientable, closed 4-manifold "M" has a spin structure (or, equivalently, the second Stiefel–Whitney class formula_1 vanishes), then the signature of its intersection form, a quadratic form on the second cohomology group formula_2, is divisible by 16. The theorem is named for Vladimir Rokhlin, who proved it in 1952.
Proofs.
Rokhlin's theorem can be deduced from the fact that the third stable homotopy group of spheres formula_16 is cyclic of order 24; this is Rokhlin's original approach.
It can also be deduced from the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. See Â genus and Rochlin's theorem.
 gives a geometric proof.
The Rokhlin invariant.
Since Rokhlin's theorem states that the signature of a spin smooth manifold is divisible by 16, the definition of the Rokhlin invariant is deduced as follows:
If "N" is a spin 3-manifold then it bounds a spin 4-manifold "M". The signature of "M" is divisible by 8, and an easy application of Rokhlin's theorem shows that its value mod 16 depends only on "N" and not on the choice of "M". Homology 3-spheres have a unique spin structure so we can define the Rokhlin invariant of a homology 3-sphere to be the element formula_23 of formula_24, where "M" any spin 4-manifold bounding the homology sphere.
For example, the Poincaré homology sphere bounds a spin 4-manifold with intersection form formula_13, so its Rokhlin invariant is 1. This result has some elementary consequences: the Poincaré homology sphere does not admit a smooth embedding in formula_26, nor does it bound a Mazur manifold.
More generally, if "N" is a spin 3-manifold (for example, any formula_24 homology sphere), then the signature of any spin 4-manifold "M" with boundary "N" is well defined mod 16, and is called the Rokhlin invariant of "N". On a topological 3-manifold "N", the generalized Rokhlin invariant refers to the function whose domain is the spin structures on "N", and which evaluates to the Rokhlin invariant of the pair formula_22 where "s" is a spin structure on "N".
The Rokhlin invariant of M is equal to half the Casson invariant mod 2. The Casson invariant is viewed as the Z-valued lift of the Rokhlin invariant of integral homology 3-sphere.
Generalizations.
The Kervaire–Milnor theorem states that if formula_29 is a characteristic sphere in a smooth compact 4-manifold "M", then 
A characteristic sphere is an embedded 2-sphere whose homology class represents the Stiefel–Whitney class formula_1. If formula_1 vanishes, we can take formula_29 to be any small sphere, which has self intersection number 0, so Rokhlin's theorem follows.
The Freedman–Kirby theorem states that if formula_29 is a characteristic surface in a smooth compact 4-manifold "M", then 
where formula_36 is the Arf invariant of a certain quadratic form on formula_37. This Arf invariant is obviously 0 if formula_29 is a sphere, so the Kervaire–Milnor theorem is a special case.
A generalization of the Freedman-Kirby theorem to topological (rather than smooth) manifolds states that
where formula_40 is the Kirby–Siebenmann invariant of "M". The Kirby–Siebenmann invariant of "M" is 0 if "M" is smooth.
Armand Borel and Friedrich Hirzebruch proved the following theorem: If "X" is a smooth compact spin manifold of dimension divisible by 4 then the Â genus is an integer, and is even if the dimension of "X" is 4 mod 8. This can be deduced from the Atiyah–Singer index theorem: Michael Atiyah and Isadore Singer showed that the Â genus is the index of the Atiyah–Singer operator, which is always integral, and is even in dimensions 4 mod 8. For a 4-dimensional manifold, the Hirzebruch signature theorem shows that the signature is −8 times the Â genus, so in dimension 4 this implies Rokhlin's theorem.
 proved that if "X" is a compact oriented smooth spin manifold of dimension 4 mod 8, then its signature is divisible by 16.

Antinori

Marchesi Antinori Srl is an Italian wine company, based in Florence, Tuscany, that can trace its history back to 1385. They are one of the biggest wine companies in Italy, and their innovations played a large part in the "Super-Tuscan" revolution of the 1970s.
Antinori is a member of the Primum Familiae Vini and the 10th oldest family owned company in the world.
History.
Rinuccio di Antinoro is recorded as making wine at the Castello di Combiate near the Tuscan town of Calenzano in 1180. The castello was destroyed in 1202, and the family moved to Florence, where they were involved in silk weaving and banking. In 1385, Giovanni di Piero Antinori joined the Guild of Winemakers, and this is the date usually taken as the start of the wine business.
The fame of their wine expanded over the years, to the extent that in 1506 they could afford to pay 4,000 florins for the Palazzo Antinori, built for the Boni family in the 1460s. At this time, Alessandro Antinori was one of the richest men in Florence, but like many Florentines he was soon bankrupted by the ravages of Emperor Charles V and the economic effect of his New World gold. Nonetheless the family prospered in the ensuing peace and gained the title of Marquis from the House of Habsburg-Lorraine in the 18th century.
In the second half of the 16th century, Bernardino Antinori had a relationship with Dianora di Toledo, wife of Pietro de' Medici the son of Cosimo I. Pietro, who was known at the time for his brutality and dishonesty, discovered the relationship, accused his wife of adultery and strangled her with a dog leash in July 1576 at the Villa Medici at Cafaggiolo. Bernardino was arrested and later killed in prison. Cosimo I exiled his son Pietro to Spain.
In 1900, Piero Antinori bought several vineyards in the Chianti Classico region, including 47 hectares at Tignanello. His son Niccolò scandalised Tuscany in 1924 by making a Chianti containing Bordeaux wine varieties. He continued to experiment over the following years with new blends, types of barrel, temperature control and bottle ageing. Niccolò retired in 1966, to be replaced by his son Piero who was even more innovative. He investigated early harvesting of white grapes, different types of barrique, stainless steel vats and malolactic fermentation of red wines.
The real revolution came in 1974 with the launch of Tignanello's first vintage, 1971: a barrique-aged wine from the vineyard bearing the same name containing Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Although the initial blend did not yet contain any Cabernet Sauvignon or Cabernet Franc, no white grape varieties were used, which meant that the wine was ineligible for the Chianti Classico appellation; from the vintage 1975 onwards, the blend contained Cabernet Sauvignon. Technically Tignanello was not the first 'Super Tuscan' – that honour goes to Sassicaia, created by a relative of the Antinoris, the Marquis Mario Incisa della Rocchetta – even though the Antinoris were experimenting with Cabernet blends since the 1920s. But it was Tignanello that really shook up the Italian wine industry, leading to far-reaching changes in rules and attitudes. Although the Chianti Classico DOCG rules have changed to accommodate wines such as Tignanello, the Antinoris continue to sell it as a Toscana IGT wine. Emboldened by the success of the 20% Bordeaux blend Tignanello, in 1978 Antinori launched Solaia - containing 80% Cabernet Sauvignon - from the neighbouring vineyard.
Antinori responded to the inflation of the 1980s and 1990s with a frantic programme of investment in wineries and vineyards, most notably the Atlas Peak winery in California in 1985, and 325 hectares around Badia a Passignano in 1987. They also expanded into Piedmont and Apulia, and set up joint ventures in Bátaapáti, Hungary, Stag's Leap and Col Solare in the USA, Malta, Romania, and Chile. Antinori took complete ownership of Col Solare in 2024.
Retail presence.
Antinori also owns and partners in retail outlets such as "Cantinetta Antinori" and "Procacci" in Via Tornabuoni in Florence, Italy.
The retail presence even extends to the United States, e.g. at the Pebble Beach resort and retail distribution throughout the United States by Ste. Michelle Wine Estates.
Media.
The company and family were featured in a segment of the CBS newsmagazine "60 Minutes" reported by Morley Safer on October 12, 2008; the segment was aired again on May 3, 2009, and on May 22, 2016, following Safer's death.

A14 autoroute

The autoroute A14 is an autoroute in the western suburbs of Paris, France. It connects the business district of La Défense, at Nanterre (Hauts-de-Seine), to Orgeval (Yvelines) where it joins the A13. Its operation is managed by the Sanef group.
History.
The motorway starts at La Défense in Hauts-de-Seine and ends at Orgeval in Yvelines. The A14 was built to relieve the congested A13 between Paris and Normandy. The A14, opened in 1996, is operated by the Société des Autoroutes de Paris Normandie. The motorway is in length and is subject to a toll.
The A14 serves no localities between La Défense and Orgeval and is only a relief road of the A13.
A motorway exit near Saint-Germain-en-Laye were planned but were denied by the French president, François Mitterrand, after mayors wanted to prevent excessive car use in the Forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Other exits were planned but their construction was blocked by communal councils.
A motorway exit was projected west of the Montesson toll booths. The mayor of Montesson had placed a condition on approval of the project that the exit may be constructed if a dual-carriageway relieving the RD121 is also built. Public consultation is in progress.
Many bridges and tunnels were built to carry the motorway. Two long bridges and a tunnel of 2.8 km long were built. The tunnel, built for 4.5 billion FRF, was built to preserve the forest of Saint-Germain.
The toll has a price that varies with the hours of the day. Free access to the motorway is given to drivers practising carpooling.
On June 19, 2024, the A14 became the first to utilize automated number plate recognition to determine the vehicle type and distance travelled to calculate the fee, thereby eliminating the requirement for toll booths.
Route.
The A14 autoroute begins in the west at Orgeval as a split from A13. It heads south-east through Poissy heading through its first tunnel and then a second with the D30 roundabout above it, and an onramp (6b) from the former enters the A14. Continuing east, there is an exit 6 to Chambourcy via the N13. Passing under the bridge of the Route de Poissy it heads south-east passing under another roundabout in Chambourcy that allows an onramp onto the A14 (6a). Shortly after this onramp, the A14 turns east then northeast passing through the southern end of the Foret Domaniale St-Germain-en-Laye as a tunnel. It exits the tunnel briefly at Saint-Germain-en-Laye just after passing under the N184 and D190 interchange before entering another tunnel and continuing under the forest. It exits the tunnel and forest near La Grille Royale and crosses the Seine river as the Viaduc Autoroutier de Montesson.
After crossing the Seine, it heads in an easterly direction crossing over the D121 on the northern outskirts of Montesson before reaching the toll station at the Gare de Peage de Montesson. Leaving the toll booth, it enters a short tunnel under the Route de Saint-Germain D311, before passing through a set of three further short tunnels as the A14 passes through the suburbs of Carrieres-sur-Seine. Leaving the town it turns south-east crossing the Seine river again that is split by the Ile Fleurie.
As the bridge ends, there is an exit to the A86 Nanterre or the D986 Nanterre Centre. Shortly after that exit, the A14 enters the Nanterre-La Defense tunnel heading east through Nanterre passing under the A86 interchange. Just after passing under the interchange, inside the tunnel, the A86 South has an onramp to the A14. In the tunnel, under La Defense, there is an exit to the D914 followed shortly by a tunnel onramp from the N13 South and from the north, the D992 enters the A14 (Avenue de la Division Leclerc). The A14 exits the tunnel just before Pont de Neuilly and ends as it continues south-east as the N13 into Paris.

George Malcolm Brown

Sir George Malcolm Brown, FRS (5 October 1925 – 27 March 1997) was one of the most respected geologists of the second half of the twentieth century. His formidable reputation as an igneous petrologist enabled him to become one of the few scientists invited by NASA to work on the Moon rock samples recovered from the Apollo 11 lunar mission.
Early life.
Brown was born in Redcar and was educated at Coatham School. Following a period in the RAF, he entered the geology department of Durham University in 1947, graduating with First Class Honours in 1950. The Professor of Geology, Lawrence Wager, recognised Brown's abilities, and took him with him as a research student following his move to the Chair in Geology at Oxford University. Brown's research centred on the ultrabasic complex of Rhum, Scotland and built upon earlier work undertaken by W.A. Deer and L.R. Wager. He received his D.Phil in 1954.
Academic career.
Expeditions to Greenland to research the Skaergaard intrusion led Brown to a one-year Harkness Fellowship at Princeton University. He returned to the UK in 1955 as a lecturer at Oxford University where his research involved the igneous intrusions of Skye, Scotland. He returned to Durham University as Professor of Geology in 1967, which served to strengthen that department's already enviable reputation. It was during his time at Durham that Brown was invited by NASA to undertake work on the Apollo 11 lunar samples. A story told to Durham geology undergraduates is that Brown accidentally left the box containing the samples on a train from London, only later to discover that NASA had delivered the genuine samples by secure delivery direct to Durham. The true story is that after appearing on the TV programme "Tomorrow's World", Brown's train from London to Durham broke down at Darlington, and he had to travel by police escort to Durham. This prompted local newspaper headlines "Americans transport moon rock 250,000 miles, BR (British Rail) couldn't take it 14 miles from Darlington to Durham"
His work on the lunar samples secured his worldwide reputation. Like another Durham University geologist before him, Kingsley Dunham, Brown was appointed director of the Institute of Geological Sciences in 1979. During a very difficult time for this Government institution, Brown successfully led a move of its headquarters from London to a site at Keyworth, near Nottingham, and the start of a new chapter for the institute as the newly-titled 'British Geological Survey'. He was knighted upon retirement in 1985.
Honours.
Brown received many awards and honours. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1975. He also received several honorary doctorates from British Universities and was awarded the Murchison Medal of the Geological Society of London. His early work with Lawrence Wager led to publication of "Layered Igneous Rocks", which even today remains an influential text.

Maine State Route 5

State Route 5 (abbreviated SR 5) is a state highway in Maine that runs from an intersection with State Route 9 in Old Orchard Beach, to an intersection with State Route 120 in Andover.
Route description.
From its southern terminus near the Pier in Old Orchard Beach, SR 5 leaves the town to the west, going towards the neighboring city of Saco. The route runs northwest from Saco, passes very briefly through a Northwest corner of Biddeford, and intersects US 202 (US 202) near the Lyman-Waterboro line. SR 5 runs concurrently with US 202 for a short distance to East Waterboro.
Between Waterboro and Cornish, SR 5 is known as the Sokokis Trail. North of Cornish, the highway follows the Saco River, crossing it at Hiram, to the town of Fryeburg. SR 5 continues north through Lovell to Bethel, where it intersects US 2. The two routes run together along the Androscoggin River to Rumford Point in the town of Rumford, where SR 5 leaves to the north. It follows parallel to the west bank of the Ellis River to the route's end in Andover.
History.
As designated in 1925, SR 5 was a longer route than it is today, originally terminating in South Arm near the southern part of Lower Richardson Lake. In 1980, it was cut back to its current northern terminus in Andover at the intersection with SR 120.
In the early 1980s, Interstate 195 (I-195) was being constructed in Saco, partially over the existing alignment of SR 5. The route was shifted alongside I-195 and partially cosigned with US 1. This remains the routing today.
Former auxiliary route.
State Route 5A was a short loop off Route 5 in Lovell. It functioned as an eastern bypass of downtown and connected to SR 5 at both ends. It was designated in 1960 and was removed from the route logs in 2003. It is now an unnumbered road.

Lady Baldwin

Charles B. "Lady" Baldwin (April 8, 1859 – March 7, 1937) was an American left-handed pitcher. He played six seasons in Major League Baseball with the Milwaukee Brewers (1884), Detroit Wolverines (1885–1888), Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1890), and Buffalo Bisons (1890).
Baldwin had his best season in 1886 when he compiled a 42–13 record and a 2.24 earned run average (ERA), threw 55 complete games, and led the National League with 323 strikeouts. Baldwin's 42 wins in 1886 set the major league record for a left-handed pitcher and remains the second highest single season total by a southpaw. Baldwin also pitched five complete games for a 4–1 record and a 1.50 ERA in the 1887 World Series. Arm troubles cut short Baldwin's major league career at age 31.
Early years.
Baldwin was born in 1859 in Oramel, Allegany County, New York, approximately 60 miles southeast of Buffalo. His father, Samuel Baldwin, was a farmer. As a boy, he moved with his family to Barry County in western Michigan, first to Johnstown Township and then to Hastings.
Baldwin was introduced to baseball in Hastings and began his pitching career for the Hastings team. His battery-mate on the Hastings team was Deacon McGuire, with whom he would later play as a member of the Detroit Wolverines.
Professional baseball career.
Grand Rapids.
Baldwin began his professional baseball career in 1883 playing for the Grand Rapids, Michigan, team in the Northwestern League.
Milwaukee Brewers.
In 1884, at age 25, Baldwin played for the Milwaukee Brewers of the Northwestern League. He compiled a 9–10 record in 22 games in the Northwestern League despite having an impressive 1.17 earned run average (ERA). The Northwestern League disbanded during the 1884 season, and the Brewers became part of the Union Association, considered a major league, toward the end of the season. Baldwin made his major league debut with the Brewers on September 30, 1884. He compiled a 1–1 record and 2.65 ERA in two games in the Union Association.
In 1885, the Brewers became members of the Western Association. Baldwin pitched impressively for the Brewers in 1885, compiling an 11–4 record and a 0.68 ERA in 16 games.
Nickname.
Baldwin was given the nickname "Lady" because of his "quiet ways" and his refusal to swear or to come into contact with either tobacco or liquor.
Detroit Wolverines.
During the 1885 season, Baldwin was acquired by the Detroit Wolverines of the National League. He appeared in 21 games for Detroit in 1885 and, despite an impressive 1.86 ERA, managed only an 11–9 record for a team that finished in sixth place with a 41–67 record. Baldwin led the National League in walks plus hits per inning pitched (0.92) and in strikeouts per nine innings pitched (6.775), and he was the only pitcher on the 1885 Detroit team to compile a winning record.
In 1886, the Wolverines acquired "The Big Four" (Dan Brouthers, Deacon White, Hardy Richardson, and Jack Rowe) from Buffalo and improved to second place and an 87–36 record. Baldwin accounted for nearly half of Detroit's victories in 1886. He compiled a record of 42–13 with a 2.24 ERA in 487 innings pitched, striking out 323 of 1,936 batters faced. Baldwin also completed 55 of 56 games, seven of which were via shutout. One of Baldwin's complete games in 1886 was a 3–0, 14-inning victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. Another was a one-hitter against Washington in June 1886 in which he struck out 13 batters.
Baldwin's 42 wins in 1886 set a major league record for a left-handed pitcher and remains the second highest single season total by a southpaw. Baldwin was also "reputed to be the first southpaw hurler to master the curve."
In 1887, the Wolverines won the National League pennant and the 1887 World Series. However, a shoulder injury sidelined Baldwin during the season, and he was "sent home without pay" in late July. Baldwin rejoined the Wolverines in August, and after resting his arm, won seven of his last eight games. Baldwin appeared in only 24 games in 1887 (down from 56 in 1886) and compiled a 13–10 record and a 3.84 ERA. The heaviest load for the 1887 team was handled by Charlie Getzien who compiled a 29–13 record. However, in the World Series, Baldwin pitched five complete games for a 4–1 record and a 1.50 ERA.
Baldwin was also a strong hitting pitcher. During Detroit's 1887 championship year, Baldwin compiled a respectable .271 batting average and a .354 on-base percentage.
In 1888, Baldwin was able to play in only six games. According to some sources, his pitching arm was "dead" from overwork in the three prior seasons. He compiled a 3–3 record in 1888, but saw his ERA balloon to 5.43—nearly 300% higher than his ERA of 1.86 just three years earlier.
Ned Hanlon, who played with Baldwin in Detroit, later said of Baldwin: "I will not hesitate in saying that 'Lady' Baldwin was the best left-handed pitcher of his day and one of the best that ever stood in the box. He had wonderful command, speed and curves, and knew how to work the batters."
Brooklyn and Buffalo.
Baldwin attempted a comeback in 1890. He split the 1890 season between the Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the National League and the Buffalo Bisons of the Players' League. He compiled a 3–5 record and 4.78 ERA in nine games for the two teams. He appeared in his final major league game on June 26, 1890, and was released by Buffalo in early July 1890.
Family and later years.
By 1890, Baldwin had returned to his hometown of Hastings, Michigan, and taken up farming. At the time of the 1900 Census, Baldwin was living in Hastings with his wife Dora E. Baldwin. He remained in Hastings for the remainder of his life and became a successful orchard owner and farmer. In 1910, he was seriously injured when he fell from a hay mow, breaking his collarbone. The injury deprived Baldwin of the full use of his right arm, and he underwent surgery at the University of Michigan Hospital to correct the problem. In 1914, he was again seriously injured after falling from a ladder and was unable to walk for months. He later went into the real estate business in Hastings.
Baldwin died in 1937 after an illness of six months at age 77. He was buried in Riverside Cemetery in Hastings.

Greek ironclad Spetsai

Spetsai (Greek: Θ/Κ Σπέτσαι) was a Greek ironclad battleship of the that served in the Royal Hellenic Navy from 1890 until 1920. She was named after the Saronic Gulf island of Spetses, which played a key role in the war at sea during the Greek War of Independence. "Spetsai" she was ordered in 1885 in response to a crisis in the Balkans and Ottoman naval expansion. The ship was launched in 1889 and delivered to Greece by 1902. She was armed with a main battery of three guns and five guns, and had a top speed of .
"Spetsai" and her sisters saw extensive service with the Greek Navy. They participated in the Greco–Turkish War in 1897 until the Great Powers intervened and prevented the Greek Navy from capitalizing on their superiority over the Ottoman Navy. "Psara" saw action in the First Balkan War at the Naval Battle of Elli and was present at the Naval Battle of Lemnos, but was too slow to actively engage the Ottoman forces. She did not see action during World War I, and was used as a naval communications school until 1929, when she was sold for scrapping.
Design.
"Spetsai" was long between perpendiculars and had a beam of and a mean draft of . She displaced as built. She was powered by a pair of marine steam engines of unknown type with steam provided by four coal-fired fire-tube boilers; they were rated at and provided a top speed of . Coal storage amounted to .
"Spetsai"s main battery consisted of three Canet guns in individual mounts. Two guns were mounted forward in barbettes on either side of the forward superstructure; these were L/34 guns. The third gun, a L/28 gun, was placed in a turret aft. The secondary battery consisted of four L/36 guns in casemates were mounted below the forward main battery, and a fifth 5.9-inch gun was placed on the centerline on the same deck as the main battery. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats. These included four L/22 guns, four 3-pounder guns, four 1-pounder guns, and six 1-pounder Hotchkiss revolver cannons. The ship was also armed with three torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and one in the bow.
The ship was armored with a mix of Creusot and compound steel. The main belt was thick in the central section and was reduced to at either end of the vessel. The main battery barbettes were protected by up to 14 inches of armor. "Spetsai" was fitted with an armor deck that was thick.
Service history.
In 1885, Greece ordered three new ironclads of the . "Spetsai" was ordered from the "Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée" shipyard in Le Havre, France, during the premiership of Charilaos Trikoupis. The ship, named for the island of Spetsai, was launched on 26 October 1889, and by 1892, she and her sister-ships and were delivered to the Greek fleet.
"Spetsai" saw limited action in the Greco–Turkish War in 1897, as the Royal Hellenic Navy was unable to make use of its superiority over the Ottoman Navy. The Ottoman Navy had remained in port during the conflict, but a major naval intervention of the Great Powers prevented the Greeks from capitalizing on their superiority. The conflict was centered on the island of Crete, which was the object of an international naval demonstration in 1897–1898; the Great Powers mediated a solution to the conflict that saw Crete returned to Ottoman control, but with a Greek prince. In 1897–1900, "Spetsai" and her sister-ships were partially rearmed; "Spetsai" was modified at the La Seyne shipyard. Their small-caliber guns were replaced with one gun forward, eight guns, four 3-pounders, and ten 1-pounder revolver cannons. One of the 14-inch torpedo tubes was replaced with a weapon. In 1908–1910, the old 5.9 in guns were replaced with new, longer L/45 models.
The Balkan League, of which Greece was a member, declared war on the Ottoman Empire in October 1912. Two months later, the Ottoman fleet attacked the Greek navy, in an attempt to disrupt the naval blockade surrounding the Dardanelles. The Ottoman fleet, which included the pre-dreadnought battleships "Turgut Reis", "Barbaros Hayreddin", the outdated ironclad battleships and , nine destroyers, and six torpedo boats, sortied from the Dardanelles in the morning, at 09:30. The smaller ships remained at the mouth of the straits while the battleships sailed north, remaining near to the coast. The Greek flotilla, which included the armored cruiser and "Spetsai" and her sisters, had been sailing from the island of Imbros to the patrol line outside the straits. When the Ottomans were sighted, the Greeks altered course to the northeast in order to block the advance of their opponents. In the ensuing Naval Battle of Elli, the Ottoman ships opened fire first, at 09:50, from a range of about ; the Greeks returned fire ten minutes later, by which time the range had decreased significantly to . At 10:04, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed their course, and steamed for the safety of the straits in a disorganized withdrawal. Within an hour, the routed Ottoman ships had withdrawn into the Dardanelles.
The Naval Battle of Lemnos resulted from an Ottoman plan to lure the faster "Georgios Averof" away from the Dardanelles. The protected cruiser evaded the Greek blockade and broke out into the Aegean Sea; the assumption was that the Greeks would dispatch "Georgios Averof" to hunt down "Hamidiye". Despite the threat to Greek lines of communication posed by the cruiser, the Greek commander refused to detach "Georgios Averof" from her position. "Georgios Averof", "Spetsai", and her two sisters appeared approximately from Lemnos; when the powerful Greek cruiser was spotted, the Ottomans turned to retreat with "Georgios Averof" in pursuit. She scored several hits on the fleeing Ottoman ships before breaking off the chase. "Spetsai" and her sisters were too slow to keep up with "Georgios Averof", and played no active part in the engagement.
At the outbreak of World War I at the end of July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I, decided to remain neutral. The Entente powers landed troops in Salonika in 1915, which was a source of tension between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the Greek Navy on 19 October 1916; the heavy units of the Greek fleet were disarmed and placed in reserve for the remainder of the war. "Spetsai" was decommissioned in 1920 and used as a naval communications school until 1929, when she was broken up for scrap.

LL77

LL77 is the debut solo album by American singer Lisa Lisa, released in 1994.
Production.
The album was produced by Guru, Nona Hendryx, and Junior Vasquez, among others. It was Lisa's intention to move away from the Latin bubblegum style of her past as lead vocalist of the band Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam by crafting a harder-sounding record.
Critical reception.
"Rolling Stone" wrote that "the songs, along with dependably crunchy rhythms, give up nifty pop hooks." "Entertainment Weekly" called the album "all atmosphere and no guts," writing that "no matter how sultry the drumbeats, Lisa Lisa’s voice is too thin to provide much soul." "The New York Times" deemed it "brave, flawed and, at moments, brilliant."

Stepped Stone Structure

The Stepped Stone Structure is the name given to the remains at a particular archaeological site (sometimes termed Area G) on the eastern side of the City of David, the oldest part of Jerusalem. The curved, , narrow stone structure is built over a series of terraces (hence the name). A casemate wall adjoins the structure from a northerly direction at the upper levels, and may have been the original city wall.
Excavation and interpretation.
Macalister, the first to excavate the structure in the 1920s, called the remains he had found a "ramp" and believed it to be Jebusite. Work continued in the 1960s with Kathleen Kenyon, who dated the structure to the start of Iron Age II (1000–900 BCE). Yigal Shiloh excavated in the 1970s–80s. After the discoveries by Kenyon and Shiloh, some scholars have suggested that the structure might be a retaining wall of a large administrative building or fortress. Israel Finkelstein "et al." propose and argue that the upper part of the structure was either built, or substantially rebuilt in the Hasmonean period. However, Jodi Magness argues that the archaeological evidence suggests that the structure was initially built in the 12th century BCE (Iron Age I).
Millo theory.
It is hypothesized that the structure may be the Biblical Millo. A recent excavation by Eilat Mazar directly above the Stepped Stone Structure shows that the structure connects with and supports the Large Stone Structure. Mazar's interpretation of the evidence yields her hypothesis that the Large Stone Structure was an Israelite royal palace in continuous use from the tenth century until 586 BCE. She motivates her conclusion that the stepped stone structure and the large stone structure are parts of a single, massive royal palace by citing the biblical reference to the House of Millo in as the place where King Joash was assassinated in 799 BCE while he slept in his bed. Millo is derived from "fill", (Hebrew "milui"). The stepped stone support structure is built of fills.

Nash was also included on the Munster team for the 2014 and 2016 Railway Cup campaigns.
Style of play.
Although regularly lining out as a goalkeeper, Nash has also been noted as a long-range free-taker and as a penalty taker. His technique for the latter — right hand on top but striking left handed — required such a high throw that it carried six or seven metres ahead of him. Using his run-in and stroke to achieve maximum velocity, Nash was only about 13 metres from the goal when he connected with the sliotar. His penalty technique was first highlighted when he scored in Cork's All-Ireland quarter-final defeat of Wexford in 2012. Commentator Ger Canning noticed how far Nash had lifted the ball, saying that it looked like the strike was closer to being 15 metres from goal as opposed to the regulation 20 metres. Nash's technique gained more prominence when he scored goals from close-in frees in each of the drawn and replayed All-Ireland finals in 2013, in spite of being charged down by Clare goalkeeper Patrick Kelly. His advancing penalties subsequently became a major talking point. The dangerous nature of it was being discussed by former goalkeepers such as Ger Cunningham and Davy Fitzgerald, while techniques to stop it were also being discussed. Other players, such as Kilkenny's T. J. Reid, also developed their own Nash-style penalty. The issue was raised again following Stephen O'Keeffe's charging down of a Nash penalty in the Munster quarter-final replay against Waterford in 2014. O'Keeffe's save with his thigh sparked a further debate regarding the safety of the penalty technique and the role of the defending goalkeeper. The GAA's Management Committee quickly clarified the rules in relation to penalties and 20-metre frees insisting that shots should be taken from the full 20 metres out with no rushing the ball from defenders. This clarification was immediately dubbed the "Nash Rule". The rule was later changed again with one-on-one penalties being implemented in 2015.

Songs of the Beatles

Songs of the Beatles is a 1981 album by Sarah Vaughan, recorded in 1977 but not released for four years due to a recording contract problem. It contains songs written and originally performed by the Beatles, with contemporaneous pop and jazz arrangements. On "Something" Vaughan was accompanied by the Brazilian singer and musician Marcos Valle.
Reception.
On balance, "Los Angeles Times" jazz writer Leonard Feather is favorable in his assessment, awarding the album three and a half stars, notwithstanding some ill-advised commercial trimmings:
"Recorded several years ago, inexplicably shelved and now belatedly released, this is neither the ill-advised venture one might fear nor a vital part of musical history. Produced and arranged by the father and son team of Marty and David Paich, it has its moments of superior Vaughan, notably on "Eleanor Rigby" and "Here, There and Everywhere." What went wrong is mostly the fault of the producers: overdressed arrangements ("Fool on the Hill"); overdubbed background singers of which Vaughan was not even made aware; a tiresome tenor sax and rigid rhythm on "Come Together." For the most part, though, on the strength of her indomitable musicianship and the inherent virtues of some of the tunes, Vaughan overcomes."

Speech–language pathology

Speech–language pathology, also known as speech and language pathology or logopedics, is a healthcare and academic discipline concerning the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of communication disorders, including expressive and mixed receptive-expressive language disorders, voice disorders, speech sound disorders, speech disfluency, pragmatic language impairments, and social communication difficulties, as well as swallowing disorders across the lifespan. It is an allied health profession regulated by professional state licensing boards in the United States of America, and Speech Pathology Australia. American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) monitors state laws, lobbies &amp; advocates for SLPs. The field of speech-language pathology is practiced by a clinician known as a speech–language pathologist (SLP) or a speech and language therapist (SLT). SLPs also play an important role in the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), often in collaboration with pediatricians and psychologists. 
History.
The development of speech-language pathology into a profession took different paths in the various regions of the world. Three identifiable trends influenced the evolution of speech-language pathology in the United States during the late 19th century to early 20th century: the elocution movement, scientific revolution, and the rise of professionalism. Groups of "speech correctionists" formed in the early 1900s. The American Academy of Speech Correction was founded in 1925, which became ASHA in 1978.
Profession.
Speech–language pathologists (SLPs) provide a wide range of services, mainly on an individual basis, but also as support for families, support groups, and providing information for the general public. SLPs work to assess levels of communication needs, make diagnoses based on the assessments, and then treat the diagnoses or address the needs. Speech/language services begin with initial screening for communication or swallowing disorders and continue with assessment and diagnosis, consultation for the provision of advice regarding management, intervention, and treatment, and providing counseling and other followup services for these disorders. Services are provided in the following areas:
Speech, language, and swallowing disorders result from a variety of causes, such as a stroke, brain injury, hearing loss, developmental delay, a cleft palate, cerebral palsy, or emotional issues.
A common misconception is that speech–language pathology is restricted to the treatment of articulation disorders (e.g., helping English-speaking individuals enunciate the traditionally difficult "r") or the treatment of individuals who stutter but, in fact, speech–language pathology is concerned with a broad scope of speech, language, literacy, swallowing, and voice issues involved in communication, some of which include:
Primary pediatric speech and language disorders include: receptive and expressive language disorders, speech sound disorders, childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), stuttering, and language-based learning disabilities. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) work with people of all ages.
Swallowing disorders include difficulties in any phase of the swallowing process (i.e., oral, pharyngeal, esophageal), as well as functional dysphagia and feeding disorders. Swallowing disorders can occur at any age and can stem from multiple causes.
Multi-discipline collaboration.
SLPs collaborate with other health care professionals, often working as part of a multidisciplinary team. They can provide information and referrals to audiologists, physicians, dentists, nurses, nurse practitioners, occupational therapists, rehabilitation psychologists, dietitians, educators, behavior consultants (applied behavior analysis), and parents as dictated by the individual client's needs. For example, the treatment for patients with cleft lip and palate often requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Speech–language pathologists can be very beneficial in helping resolve speech problems associated with cleft lip and palate. Research has indicated that children who receive early language intervention are less likely to develop compensatory error patterns later in life, although speech therapy outcomes are usually better when surgical treatment is performed earlier. Another area of collaboration relates to auditory processing disorders, where SLPs can collaborate in assessments and provide intervention where there is evidence of speech, language, and/or other cognitive-communication disorders.
Working environments.
SLPs work in a variety of clinical and educational settings. SLPs work in public and private hospitals, private practices, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), long-term acute care (LTAC) facilities, hospice, and home healthcare. SLPs may also work as part of the support structure in the education system, working in both public and private schools, colleges, and universities. Some SLPs also work in community health, providing services at prisons and young offenders' institutions or providing expert testimony in applicable court cases.
Following ASHA's 2005 approval of the delivery of speech/language services via video conference or telepractice, SLPs in the United States have begun to use this service model.
Children with speech, language, and communication needs (SLCN) are particularly at risk of not being heard because of communication challenges. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) can explain the significance of supporting communication as a tool for the child to shape and influence choices available to them in their lives, even though it is advised that children with SLCN can and should be actively involved as equal partners in decision-making about their communication needs. Building these skills is especially crucial for SLPs working in settings related to traditional education.
Research.
SLPs conduct research related to communication sciences and disorders, swallowing disorders, or other upper aerodigestive functions.
Experimental, empirical, and scientific methodologies that build on hypothesis testing and logical, deductive reasoning have dominated research in speech-language pathology. Other types of research in the field are complemented by qualitative research.
Education and training.
United States.
In the United States, speech–language pathologists must hold a master's degree from an ASHA-accredited program. Following graduation and passing a nation-wide board exam, SLPs typically begin their Clinical Fellowship Year, during which they are granted a provisional license and receive guidance from their supervisor. At the end of this process, SLPs apply for full state licensure and may choose to apply &amp; purchase ASHA's Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) annually. SLPs may additionally choose to earn advanced degrees such as a clinical doctorate in speech–language pathology, PhD, or EdD. 
Methods of assessment.
Many approaches exist to assess language, communication, speech and swallowing. Two main aspects of assessment can be to determine the extent of breakdown (impairment-level), or how communication can be supported (functional level). When evaluating impairment-based level of breakdown, therapists are trained to use a cognitive neuropsychological approach to assessment, to precisely determine what aspect of communication is impaired. Some therapists use assessments that are based on historic anatomical models of language, that have since been shown to be unreliable. These tools are often preferred by therapists working within a medical model, where medics request a 'type' of impairment, and a 'severity' rating. The broad tools available allow clinicians to precisely select the aspect of communication that they wish to assess.
Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some students may not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, students are more likely to qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.
Clients and patients.
Speech–language pathologists work with clients and patients who may present with a wide range of issues.
Infants and children.
United States.
In the US, some children are eligible to receive speech therapy services, including assessment and lessons through the public school system. If not, private therapy is readily available through personal lessons with a qualified speech–language pathologist or the growing field of telepractice. Teleconferencing tools such as Zoom are being used more commonly as a means to access remote locations in private therapy practice, such as in the geographically diverse south island of New Zealand. More at-home or combination treatments have become readily available to address specific types of articulation disorders. The use of mobile applications in speech therapy is also growing as an avenue to bring treatment into the home.
United Kingdom.
In the UK, children are entitled to an assessment by local NHS speech- and language-therapy teams, usually after referral by health visitors or education settings, but parents are also entitled to request an assessment directly. If treatment is appropriate, an educational plan will be drawn up. Speech therapists often play a role in multi-disciplinary teams when a child has speech delay or disorder as part of a wider health condition. The Children's Commissioner for England reported in June 2019 that there was a postcode lottery; £291.65 a year per head was spent on services in some areas, while the budget in some areas was £30.94 or less. In 2018, 193,971 children in English primary schools were on the special educational needs register needing speech-therapy services.
Speech and language therapists work in acute settings and are often
integrated into the MDT in multiple areas of speciality for neonatal, children and adult services. Areas include but not limited to; neonatal care, respiratory, ENT, gastrointestinal, stroke, Neurology,ICU, oncology and geriatric care

Alabama State Route 21

State Route 21 (SR 21) is a state highway that extends from the Florida state line, near Atmore in Escambia County to Piedmont in Calhoun County. The route travels almost the entire length of the state from the northeast to the southwest. It is the longest signed state route in Alabama.
Route description.
Starting at the northern terminus of Florida State Road 97 at the Florida state line south of Atmore, the route travels north through Atmore, passing under an intersection with Interstate 65 at exit 57, then enters Monroe County and travels northeast through Frisco City and Monroeville and is concurrent with SR 47 for part of this section. SR 21 then once again becomes a standalone route passing through Beatrice and Oak Hill. In Lowndes County, SR 21 begins its first concurrency with US 80, and the two highways enter Montgomery, the state capital, from the southwest. SR 21 then diverges northeastward from US 80 for a short concurrency with US 31, then travels concurrently with US 80 once again (as well as US 82) around the Montgomery city center, diverging from US 82 at US 231 and traveling concurrently with US 231 northward to Sylacauga at an interchange with US 280. From Sylacauga, SR 21 turns northeastward toward Talladega. The route travels close to the Talladega National Forest and the Talladega Superspeedway. From here, SR 21 continues generally northeastward through the cities of Oxford, Anniston, and Jacksonville before terminating at an intersection with U.S. Highway 278 in Piedmont. The route is paved throughout and often multi-lane.
