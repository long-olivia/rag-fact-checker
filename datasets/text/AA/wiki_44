Waldron Smithers

Sir Waldron Smithers (5 October 1880 – 9 December 1954) was a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was a member of Parliament for more than 30 years and an active anti-communist.
Early life and family.
Smithers was educated at Charterhouse and in France and became a member of the London Stock Exchange. He was the eldest son of Sir Alfred Smithers, who had been Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Chislehurst until 1922. In 1904 Waldron Smithers married Marjorie Page-Roberts, with whom he had two sons and two daughters.
Politics.
At the 1924 general election he stood for his father's constituency and won a three-cornered fight with a majority of more than 10,000. In his 30 years in the House of Commons he was always a backbencher, described by "The Times" as a 'diehard Tory' although well-liked on both sides of the house. In his memoirs, "Way of Life", his fellow Conservative John Boyd-Carpenter described Smithers as "an extreme Tory out of a vanished age" and both deeply religious and "not insensitive to the consoling effect of alcohol". Harold Macmillan said he "fondly believed himself to be a good Tory". He was knighted in the 1934 Birthday Honours.
Smithers remained as member for Chislehurst until the 1945 general election, when he switched to the newly created Orpington constituency. Chislehurst fell to the Labour Party, but Smithers was comfortably elected in Orpington, and held the seat until he died.
In October 1945, an antisemitic petition was drawn up, with the help of Smithers's Fighting Fund for Freedom, by residents of Hampstead, requesting "that aliens of Hampstead should be repatriated to assure men and women of the Forces should have accommodation upon their return" from World War II. The petition was signed by the antisemitic Conservative mayor of Hampstead Sydney A. Boyd and four of Hampstead's Conservative councillors, with the rest of the Conservative members of the council in favour of the petition. Hampstead's Conservative MP, Charles Challen, promised to give the petition his "unstinting support" and he asked a number of questions in the House of Commons on behalf of the petitioners over the following months. When the petition was complete, Conservative Councillor J. A. Hughes passed it to Challen who, "rather than repudiate the sponsors for their antisemitism", delivered it to Parliament.
During the Cold War, while MP for Orpington, Smithers in 1947 pressed for a House of Commons Select Committee on un-British Activities to be created to conduct anti-communist investigations, to mirror the U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee. In 1952, fearing possible sabotage, he wrote to Winston Churchill asking for an enquiry into communist influence at the BBC. "We have traitors in our midst", he wrote, "and although I should deplore suppression of free speech they should be treated as traitors." The letter was not released until January 2016.
In drama.
In the 2008 TV drama "The Long Walk to Finchley", about the early career of Margaret Thatcher, Smithers was played by Michael Cochrane.
Death.
Smithers died on 9 December 1954 aged 74.

3rd World Scout Jamboree

The 3rd World Scout Jamboree was held in 1929 at Arrowe Park in Upton, near Birkenhead, Wirral, United Kingdom. As it was commemorating the 21st birthday of "Scouting for Boys" and the Scouting movement, it is also known as the Coming of Age Jamboree. With about 30,000 Scouts and over 300,000 visitors attending, this jamboree was the largest jamboree so far.
Organizational details.
From 29 July to 12 August 1929, the third World Scout Jamboree was held at Arrowe Park in the village of Upton, approximately from the town of Birkenhead, United Kingdom. This jamboree commemorated the 21st birthday of Scouting, counting from the publication of the book "Scouting for Boys" by General Baden-Powell. Therefore, this jamboree is also known as the Coming of Age Jamboree.
The Jamboree on a site of was opened by the Duke of Connaught, the president of the Boy Scout Association, and thirty thousand Scouts and Girl Guides of many countries attended. During the first week, the weather was poor, turning the park grass into ankle deep mud, gaining the jamboree its nickname "jamboree of mud".
The camp was organized in eight subcamps, around a specially built town in the middle, called Midway, where Scouts could purchase materials. Each subcamp provided pitches for a contingent of Scouts troops. The organization of daily chores such as cooking, campfire collecting, etc. were done in turn by the groups.
The Girl Guides in Cheshire were asked to run a hospital under canvas. There were 321 cases admitted and 2323 out-patient cases during the Jamboree. Only 52 cases had to be sent to other hospitals. Staff dealt with a range of problems from minor cuts, burns and sprains to fractures and head injuries. Two Guiders ran a dispensary providing both prescription and non-prescription medicines. There was also a dental clinic and an operating theatre. The hospital canteen provided meals for patients and the 50 members of staff, including many special diets, all cooked on open fires. Staff were asked to accommodate lost boys after the Wolf Cub rally. The hospital was also proud to be asked to provide the bedding and equipment for the Prince of Wales' tent. This hospital had the far-reaching effect that many heads of Boy Scout movements from other countries saw the excellent work of the Girl Guides and changed their attitudes towards them.
Events during the jamboree.
On Baden-Powell a peerage was to be conferred by King George V, as was announced on 2 August by the Prince of Wales who attended the Jamboree in Scout uniform. The formal title of "Baron Baden-Powell, of Gilwell, co. Essex" was granted on 17 September 1929, confirming the high notion Baden-Powell had of education and training, after Gilwell Park where the international Scout Leader training in the Wood Badge course took place.
In the morning of Sunday 4 August, an open-air thanksgiving service was held, presided by Cosmo Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury, and by Francis Bourne, Archbishop of Westminster, for Protestant and Catholic Scouts; and later that day a service was also held in Liverpool Cathedral.
On 10 August, the Chief Scout Sir Robert Baden-Powell was given special attention. On behalf of all Scouts worldwide, he was presented with a Rolls-Royce motor car and a caravan trailer. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles and is now on display at Gilwell Park. These gifts were paid for by penny donations of more than 1 million Scouts worldwide. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by Olave Baden-Powell in 1945. Jam Roll and Eccles were reunited at Gilwell for the 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007. Recently it has been purchased on behalf of Scouting and is owned by a charity, B–P Jam Roll Ltd. Funds are being raised to repay the loan that was used to purchase the car. Also he was given an oil painted portrait by David Jagger, which since has been used as a publicity picture by many Scout organizations. It is on display in the Baden-Powell House. Lastly, Baden-Powell was given a cheque for £2,750 and an illuminated address.
Closing ceremony and Golden Arrow.
The farewell ceremony on the last day, 12 August, consisted of a march with flags and banners past the royal box with the Chief Scout and other officers, ending in a Wheel of Friendship formed by the Scouts, with 21 spokes symbolic for the 21 years of Scouting. While burying a hatchet in a cask of gilded wooden arrows, Baden-Powell addressed the gathered Scouts.
Then he sent the golden arrows as peace symbols to the North, South, West, and East, through the spokes of the Wheel of Friendship.
The "Golden Arrows" are wooden gilded, about 40 centimeter-long. It is not certain how many arrows there were. Three of the Golden Arrows are placed in England. One in the Museum at the Youlbury Scout Activity Centre, near Oxford. The other, given to the Polish contingent in 1929, was last seen in 2000 in Warsaw, Poland. 
"I shot an arrow into the air, It fell to earth I know not where..."
In 1996, during the camp celebrating the re-admittance to World Scouting of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association, the Golden Arrow was given to Polish International Commissioner.
Memorabilia.
For the event, a memorial sculpture by sculptor Edward Carter Preston was erected in 1931 at an entrance to the park, now within the grounds of Arrowe Park Hospital. It was commissioned by the Boy Scout Movement and unveiled by Lord Hampton, the Headquarter's Commissioner. After restoration in the early 1980s, it was re-unveiled in 1983 by the then Chief Scout Major-General Michael Walsh.

In the pilot, the FBI investigates the disappearance of Maggie Cartwright, a successful advertising executive who was last seen arriving at 9:45 pm one evening. As they interview her friends and family, they learn that she was a role player who adapted her personality to the person she dealt with. When they discover that she had liquidated all of her assets and transferred them to London, they think they may be dealing with a runaway, but when her wealthy mother receives a ransom demand, they're not sure if Maggie has been kidnapped or if she's an extortionist.

Plot.
The missing persons team, complete with new recruit Martin, is dispatched to find missing Maggie Cartwright, a twenty-something marketing executive. At first, she appears to have everything, including a successful career and two loving divorced parents, but when the squad, led by Jack, digs deeper, agents discover that Maggie was desperately unhappy with several aspects of her life; not only did she have a checkered dating history, including a relationship with a married co-worker, but she was also involved with drugs. The team suspects that Maggie may have been suicidal, but changes its theory when an emailed ransom note, complete with proof of life, arrives at Maggie's mother's home. The kidnapper is demanding $1 million in return for Maggie's release, and the team must battle against time to save her. Martin makes a crucial mistake on his first day.

Amelia Court House, Virginia

Amelia Court House (also known as Amelia Courthouse and Amelia) is the county seat of Amelia County in the U.S. state of Virginia and a census-designated place (CDP). The population as of the 2010 census was 1,099. The town was named for Princess Amelia of Great Britain, the second daughter of Great Britain's King George II, in 1735.
History.
Amelia Court House was founded in a rural area of the Virginia Piedmont developed for plantations of mixed crops. In the 19th century, spas were developed around nearby mineral springs, which served as vacation destinations for travelers. Visitors arrived by railroad after one was built to serve the area. Among the planters who came to the spas with their families was Robert E. Lee, the future Confederate general.
By the 1850s, the new Richmond and Danville Railroad (later the Southern Railway) had been extended to the village. The R&amp;D was a crucial supply line for the Confederacy during the Civil War. After General Robert E. Lee retreated from Petersburg in 1865, he spent April 4 and 5 in Amelia Court House waiting for desperately needed supplies from Richmond. Those supplies never arrived. Instead, a train came through carrying government documents. The last major engagement of Lee's army with Union forces occurred April 6, 1865, on the border of Amelia County at the Battle of Sayler's Creek. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.
The offices of Amelia's court clerks contain records dating before the Civil War, unlike many other Virginia courthouses, which lost such records in wartime destruction. The Union forces were rushing to catch up to Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and did not ensure that the courthouse records were burned. The iron shutters and brick construction of the courthouse protected its contents .
In the 20th century, the area was still known for the amazonite produced at the Morefield Mine. Amazonite is a crystallized stone, a green variety of microcline feldspar.
A countywide festival called Amelia Day is held each May on the Saturday before Mother's Day. The festival started in the 1980s to celebrate the town's founding. Vendors, local clubs, and citizens organize to enjoy music, dancing, and socializing. At the first Amelia Day, residents signed a long roll that, along with other items, was put in a time capsule and buried in the courthouse green near the Confederate War Memorial.
Tornadoes.
In 2003, Amelia Day was cancelled after the courthouse green was struck by an F1 tornado on Friday, May 8, the day before the festival. The tornado destroyed most of the trees on the green.
A small Virginia tornado alley exists in Central Virginia, and Amelia County has had numerous tornado touchdowns. Tornadoes of note include the April 30, 1924, twister that passed east of the courthouse area, traveling from Jetersville to Chula, killing one person and injuring seven others. A tornado hit Amelia County on October 13, 1983, one of a family of tornadoes that affected much of Central and Northern Virginia. Other strong tornadoes have affected the county, especially to the east.
Transportation.
State Routes.
 (Five Forks Rd., N. Five Forks Rd., and Virginia, Court, Washington, &amp; Church Streets)
Climate.
Like much of the South, the area is characterized by long, hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Amelia Court House has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.
Demographics.
Amelia Court House was first listed as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. Census.

<doc id="7032176" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7032176" title="The Liverpool Roadrunners">
The Liverpool Roadrunners

The Roadrunners were an English band that emerged from the burgeoning music scene in 1960s Liverpool. (They were billed either as The Roadrunners or as The Road Runners. The word "Liverpool" has been added to distinguish them from other bands who subsequently used the name.)
Unlike many of their Liverpool contemporaries, they specialised in a Chicago blues / Muddy Waters / Bo Diddley / Bobby Bland style of rhythm and blues – a genre of music which was more popular in Southern England at the time, led by the up-and-coming Rolling Stones.
Bill Harry, editor of "Mersey Beat", recollects that George Harrison once said that "The Stones are good – almost as good as the Roadrunners".
The band was resident at the Hope Hall (now the Liverpool Everyman Theatre). Here they entertained students from the nearby university and art school. They also took part in "happenings" organised by Liverpool poet Adrian Henri. The band also performed many times at the Cavern Club. They were invited to support The Beatles on their last Cavern gig on 3 August 1963 and, on 28 February 1964, were on the bill of the first annual British Rhythm and Blues Festival held in Birmingham. They supported the Rolling Stones when they played at the Cavern 5 November 1963.
Two trips were made to Hamburg's Star-Club, first over the Christmas and into the New Year period of 1963 / 64 and again during July / August 1964. While at the Star-Club, the group recorded two sessions for the club's own Star-Club Record label that were initially only released in Germany under the titles of "Twist-Time im Star-Club 4" and "Tanz-Show im Star-Club 2".
Line-up.
The original line-up was:
Inevitably there were changes in the line-up. The first being the leaving of guitarist Dave Percy and the arrival of two sax players (Nick Carver a.k.a. Nick le Grec and American Johnny Phillips) following the group's first Hamburg engagement. The band have commented that, by 1964, "everyone was jumping on the R&amp;B bandwagon, so it was time to move on". Their second Star Club Records release – recorded live on-stage in front of a Star-Club audience – reflects a move towards a more contemporary soul / blues sound in the manner of James Brown and was very much facilitated by the sax sound of Johnny Phillips and Nick Carver. Unfortunately, Johnny Phillips was obliged to leave the group at the end of their second Hamburg stint. As a US citizen, he had been working in the UK without a work permit and was advised not to attempt returning to Liverpool with the other members of the band.
Success in Britain was elusive. Recording deals were talked about, but never seemed to happen.
The Roadrunners make two contributions to the recording of the grandly-named "First Annual R&amp;B Festival" (1964) and also cut an EP to help raise money for Liverpool University's rag or "panto" week (a charity fund raising event).
Mike Hart left the band to pursue a solo career, recording two albums for John Peel's "Dandelion" label. (Peel was a British radio presenter who championed the innovative rather than the commercially successful.) In 1980 he began work on a third solo project. Five tracks were recorded, but none were released. They have been rediscovered, remastered and put online via the Roadrunners' website.
The band finally split in 1966.
In an article published in the "Liverpool Post" newspaper, 31 May 2011, poet Roger McGough stated that his and the Beatles' favourite band of the time was the Roadrunners.

Jedara Bale ( ) is a 1968 Indian Kannada-language spy thriller written and directed by the duo Dorai–Bhagavan. It stars Rajkumar in the lead role, alongside Jayanthi, K. S. Ashwath, Narasimharaju, and Udayakumar. The music for the film was composed by G. K. Venkatesh. The film is the first installment in the "CID 999" franchise, which went on to include three sequels: "Goa Dalli CID 999" (1968), "Operation Jackpot Nalli C.I.D 999" (1969), and "Operation Diamond Racket" (1978). The CID 999 franchise is notable as the first Indian film series to consist of four installments.
The film is regarded as one of the earliest Indian productions to adopt the "James Bond"-style spy thriller genre. Rajkumar's portrayal of CID 999 made him one of the first Indian actors to take on a character inspired by James Bond in a leading role. Bhagavan reportedly studied 11 James Bond novels before creating the film. Produced on a modest budget of under ₹3 lakh, the film recovered ₹2 lakh from the sale of dubbing rights alone. It also introduced cabaret dance sequences to South Indian cinema.
"Jedara Bale" and its subsequent installments played a significant role in shaping Kannada cinema. The franchise's success inspired similar spy thrillers in other South Indian languages. Critics have praised the film for its engaging plot and effective suspense, which have been noted to hold their appeal even decades after its release. In 2020, "Film Companion" highlighted its narrative-driven approach as a defining aspect. The film also contributed to Rajkumar's stardom and is credited with bringing a shift in the cinematic trends of Kannada films. It was the first character based trilogy in India.
Plot.
Prakash, code-named CID "999", is assigned the mission of preventing a formula that can turn any metal into gold from falling into the hands of criminals.
Production.
It was also the first south Indian film to use the miniature faking technique for a car explosion sequence. Additionally, it was Rajkumar's first film without a male playback singer.
Soundtrack.
The music for the film was composed by G. K. Venkatesh with Ilayaraja serving as the assistant.
Legacy.
"Amar Ujala" referred to Rajkumar as the "James Bond of India". The film is considered a game-changer in Rajkumar's career and is credited with bringing a significant shift in Kannada cinema.
The film is credited with inspiring a distinct 'desi Bond ' genre, leading the Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam film industries to attempting replicating the Kannada spy movie genre, though there were earlier, less developed attempts in those industries The film's tremendous success prompted more serious efforts in other South Indian languages, featuring leading stars such as Jaishankar in Tamil; Krishna in Telugu and Prem Nazir in Malayalam.

Alfred Smithers

Sir Alfred Waldron Smithers (4 October 1850 – 22 August 1924) was a British businessman and politician, and a pioneer of the railway industry in England and Canada.
Biography.
Smithers was born in Brixton, Surrey. His parents, William Henry Smithers and Emma Turner, married the prior December. His father a Bank of England employee, Alfred was a member of the London Stock Exchange 1873–1909.
From the 1820s, clients dealt with stockbrokers, who would direct jobbers to make trades. In 1909, Stock Exchange rules formalized this separation that minimized dishonest trading. Stockbrokers came from higher social standing, whereas jobbers were commoners. By the 1980s, Akroyd &amp; Smithers was one of the five major London jobbing firms. Although Alfred is mentioned as a partner in this firm, an 1879 restructuring of the partnership only mentions a John Smithers.
Alfred was deputy chair of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway for some years, He became a director of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) in 1895, making his first trip to Canada the next year to view the railway's operations. In 1903, the board reluctantly approved Charles Melville Hays' westward expansion plans under the auspices of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTPR). Board chair and president, Charles Rivers Wilson, delegated Alfred as GTPR spokesperson, probably a vice president by this time.
Following as chair 1909–1921, Alfred made the first contribution to the fund for an Anglican church at Smithers, British Columbia, a place named in his honour. Publicly, Alfred blamed World War I for the railway's subsequent financial predicament. He revisited Canada a number of times prior to the bankruptcy of the GTPR and GTR. He described those years when fighting for the company as "11 years of purgatory".
In March 1880 Alfred married Emma Roberta Theobald (1859–1934). Their children were Waldron (1880–1954), Florence (1882–1942), Langley (1884–1955), Hubert (1885–1953), Eva (1886–1973), and Norman (1887–1976). Hubert, BC, a former train station, was named after son Hubert.
One of the stained glass windows in St Katharine's Church, Knockholt, Kent, England, is a memorial to Alfred &amp; Emma Smithers. Knockholt, BC, a former train station, was named after Knockholt, Kent, the location of the family home. Knighted in 1919, Alfred was Coalition Unionist member of parliament for Chislehurst from 1918 to 1922. His son Waldron was later elected to this constituency.

<doc id="7032325" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7032325" title="Ban Dainagon Ekotoba">
Ban Dainagon Ekotoba

 is a late 12th-century "emakimono" (handscroll painting) depicting the events of the Ōtemmon Conspiracy, an event of Japan's early Heian period. The painting, attributed to Tokiwa Mitsunaga, is over long and about tall.
History.
It is widely believed that these handscrolls were ordered by the retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa (1127-1192, r. 1155–1158) to pacify the angry spirit of Tomo no Yoshio after the imperial Ōtenmon burnt down during the Kyoto fire in 1177. Regardless of whether the scroll was made as a result of the fire in 1177, it appears that the intention of the scroll is to mollify Tomo no Yoshio's angry spirit.
Description.
The scroll itself depicts the events of the Ōtenmon conspiracy involving Tomo no Yoshio, which occurred on the tenth day of the third month of 866. Tomo no Yoshio's regret was emphasized in the scrolls through the written text in an attempt to protect against the vengeful will of Tomo no Yoshio's spirit.
The full-color painting depicts the events of the 3rd month of 866, in which Ban Dainagon, also known as Tomo no Yoshio, set fire to the Ōtemmon gate of Kyoto. He then blamed one of his political rivals, Minister of the left Minamoto no Makoto for the fire. However, the true culprit was soon discovered, and Tomo no Yoshio was banished to Izu province.
Stylistically, the scroll is interesting because it is done using a combination of the "otoko-e" and "tsukuri-e" styles. Calligraphic lines are used to define figures, which characterizes the "otoko-e" style used in the "shigisan-engi" scroll. However, thick coats of bright colors are used in some scenes, typical of the "tsukuri-e" style used in the "Genji Monogatari Emaki".
Plot of the three scrolls.
Vol. 1 — The first scroll illustrates the burning of the Otemmon gate while people tried to put out the flames, followed by the proof that Makoto was unjustly accused of his actions during the misunderstandings.
Vol. 2 — The Second scroll showcased the consolation to Makoto while he is praying to the gods and Buddha despite the fact that he did not do the actions which he was accused of. After that, they showed the suspicions about Tomo no Yoshio burning the gates. This imagery is rather indirect. It illustrates children arguing in the streets, later joined by their parents to abuse them and then gossiping amongst themselves about Tomo no Yoshio burning the gates.
Vol. 3 — The Third Scroll displays the arrest of Tomo no Yoshio as he is sent to exile. The picture indicates that Tomo no Yoshio had a servant who accidentally revealed the true culprit to the burning of the gate and after being arrested, he confessed to the police about what happened. The women in his mansion seemed morally weakened as they weep while Tomo no Yoshio is being taken to exile by the police in an ox cart.

The film released on 24 July 2004. It was dubbed and released in Tamil as "Hanumaan" and in Hindi as "My Boss Bajarangbali". It was remade in Odia as "Chaati Chiri Dele Tu."
Plot.
Anji's parents are devotees of Lord Hanuman. Anji's father, an engineer, dreams to develop his village by constructing a dam to irrigate the surrounding areas of the village. Unfortunately, he and his wife are murdered by the cruel village head Brahmam and his henchmen. Anji now becomes an orphan, and the village's Lord Rama temple's head priest raises him as his own son. Anji naturally becomes a great devotee of Lord Hanuman and starts working as an assistant to the head priest. He gradually becomes everyone's favorite and is loved by all the people in the village. Paddu too develops love on Anji over time and starts coming after him all the time. Now once again, the village head, with the support of a black magician, plans to kill Anji to gain supernatural powers.
Lord Hanuman comes in disguise as a human to the temple and introduces himself with the name "Anji" to Anji. Anji allows Anji (Hanuman) to stay with him, and both become good friends in the process. Anji (Hanuman) secures Anji from the evil attacks every time and makes Anji perform the final rites of his dead parents. However, this is watched by some villagers, and they get frightened, assuming Anji (Anjaneya) to perform black magic. Many instances like this make the villagers believe that Anji has unseen powers. Anji finally kills the black magician, who attempts to kill Anji on behalf of the village head. When Anji learns of this, he misunderstands the situation and tells Anji (Hanuman) to go away. Anji (Hanuman) tries to explain, but Anji (Anjaneya) in rage tells the former to leave him.
Later, the village head, with the support and testimonies of some villagers of the instances which had Anji doing unreal things, holds Anji responsible for the death of the black magician and tries to kill him, claiming that he is performing black magic. But this is stopped by the head priest, who pleads the village head to not kill Anji and asks him to just expel him out of the village as a punishment. Anji gets expelled out of the village, but he does not care and comes again to the village. He is stopped by the villagers, but some of them start bowing down to Anji for the support he got from Lord Hanuman. Anji, unable to get their point, questions them and happens to realize that the Anji who has been with him all these days was not visible to any other villager except him. He even tells many instances which had Anji with him performing unreal things. But all the villagers say that they have not seen anyone with the name Anji beside Anji all these days.
Later, Anji realizes through the head priest that the one with the name Anji who has been with him all the time was none other than Lord Hanuman. Anji ultimately gets shocked and realizes his mistake. He hits his head with a brick in front of Lord Hanuman's statue out of remorse and falls unconscious. He witnesses Lord Hanuman instructing him to build the dam and name it as Seethamma Thalli Dam. Anji starts doing so, but the village head once again tries to kill him. This time, Lord Hanuman helps Anji and beats up the villains. Finally, Anji, with the help of the villagers, completes the dam, thereby fulfilling his parents' dream of constructing the dam.
Soundtrack.
The music was composed by Mani Sharma. Music was released on Maruthi Music Company. In a music review of the film, Sreya Sunil wrote that "Overall, Mani Sharma as extremely catchy tunes in this album".
Reception.
Jeevi of "Idlebrain.com" opined that "The film picks up the momentum from the scene where Arjun descends on to the earth. And the movie is entertaining and educating as long as Arjun is there in the film with him making Nitin do miracles and also the philosophical conversation with Nitin". A critic from "Indiaglitz" said that "Vamsi's main problem, as a director, is that he has tried to cram too many things in too small a canvas. The result is he is successful only in a few things". Mithun Verma of "Full Hyderabad" stated that "In short, only the Gods can rescue this movie. But there's not enough reason for them, too".

Matthew Ward (writer)

Matthew Ward (1950/1951 – June 23, 1990) was an American English/French translator noted for his 1989 rendition of Albert Camus' "The Stranger". He made several important alterations from the more British-toned translation by Stuart Gilbert. Most notably he altered the quite well known opening line "Mother died today" to "Maman died today". Ward defended the alteration by noting that the more juvenile "Maman" reflects the "curious feeling he (Meursault) has for her". Other examples of Ward altering Gilbert's version include the line, "Il était avec son chien" from, "As usual, he had his dog with him" to "He was with his dog". Once again Ward felt this better reflected Meursault's character. Indeed, later in the novel Meursault notes Salamano's dog is worth no more or less than his wife.
Other authors he has translated include Roland Barthes, Colette, Pablo Picasso and Jean-Paul Sartre. He also wrote literary criticism and poetry.
Ward died of AIDS in 1990 at the age of 39.
He received the PEN Translation Prize in 1989.

Saint James Cavalier

Saint James Cavalier () is a 16th-century cavalier in Valletta, Malta, which was built by the Order of St John. It overlooks St James' Bastion, a large obtuse-angled bastion forming part of the Valletta Land Front. St James was one of nine planned cavaliers in the city, although eventually only two were built, the other one being the identical Saint John's Cavalier. It was designed by the Italian military engineer Francesco Laparelli, while its construction was overseen by his Maltese assistant Girolamo Cassar. St James Cavalier never saw use in any military conflict, but it played a role during the Rising of the Priests in 1775.
The cavalier is located in Castille Square, close to Auberge de Castille, the Central Bank of Malta, the Parliament House, the Malta Stock Exchange and the post office at Dar Annona. The cavalier was restored as part of Malta's Millennium Project. It is now a cultural centre known as Spazju Kreattiv (Maltese for "Creative Space").
History.
Hospitaller rule.
Following the Great Siege of Malta of 1565, in which the Ottoman Empire unsuccessfully attempted to capture Malta, the Order of St John decided to settle permanently on the island. The Order decided to build a new fortified city as their new capital, and it was called Valletta after Grand Master Jean Parisot de Valette. In order to do this, De Valette asked for financial aid from various European rulers. Pope Pius V not only helped out financially, but also sent the Italian military engineer Francesco Laparelli to Malta to design the new capital's fortifications. Construction of the city began in March 1566, and work continued throughout the 1570s. Following Laparelli's departure from Malta and his subsequent death, construction of the city was entrusted to his Maltese assistant, the architect and military engineer Girolamo Cassar. St James Cavalier, in its early years, was often known as the "Tower of the Cavalier", "Cavalier Tower" or the variants.
St James Cavalier was one of the first buildings to be built in Valletta, along with the Church of Our Lady of Victories and the rest of the fortifications. The cavalier was built as a raised platform on which guns were placed to defend the city against attacks from the landward side, in the area where the town of Floriana was later built. As well as prohibiting entry, St James could also threaten those who had already breached the city's defences. It was linked to Saint John's Cavalier by a now-blocked underground passageway.
The cavalier was also used as a gun signalling station. Three rounds were fired every day, at sunrise, noon and sunset. The former and the latter marked the opening and closing of the city gates. Gun signals continued to be fired from the cavalier until around 1800, when they began to be fired from the nearby Saluting Battery.
In 1686, during the magistracy of Gregorio Carafa, a small building known as "Dar Annona" was grafted on the east flank of the cavalier. The building originally housed the Università dei Grani, and is now a post office.
On 8 September 1775, St James Cavalier was captured by rebels during the Rising of the Priests. The Order's flag was lowered and a banner of Saint Paul raised instead. Fort Saint Elmo was also taken over by the rebels, but the Order managed to retake it after a brief exchange of fire. Soon after the fort was taken, the rebels at St James surrendered. Three of them were executed, while the rest were exiled or imprisoned. The heads of the three executed men were displayed on the corners of St James Cavalier, but were removed soon after Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc was elected Grand Master in November of the same year.
19th and 20th centuries.
After taking control of Malta in the beginning of the 19th century, the British converted the cavalier into an officers' mess, a place where soldiers could socialize. Some modifications were made to the structure at this point, including replacing the ramp leading to the roof by a staircase, and increasing the number of rooms by building an arched ceiling within the ground floor room, therefore creating two stories where there had been only one. Changes were also made to help combat humidity.
Later on, two cisterns were excavated within the cavalier to store water pumped to Valletta via the Wignacourt Aqueduct. The cavalier stored water for the entire city.
In 1853, a proposal was made to demolish the cavalier to make way for a hospital, but nothing materialized.
In World War II, the building was also used as a bomb shelter, while its upper floor became a food store for the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes.
In the 1970s, the Government Printing Press moved from the Grandmaster's Palace to St James, and it remained there until new premises at Marsa Industrial Estate were opened in 1996.
Cultural centre.
In the 1990s, the Government of Malta commissioned a Master Plan for the rehabilitation of Valletta and its outskirts. The project included restoring St James Cavalier and converting it for cultural purposes. The restoration was undertaken by the Maltese architect Richard England.
Throughout the course of renovation, St James has been transformed from an edifice designed to prohibit entry to one which welcomes visitors. England described the task of making this change as "making it possible for the building to accommodate new needs in a way that, while respecting the past, accepts the concept of change, without fear." However, the work was the cause of much controversy and was deemed unsatisfactory by many Maltese, partly resulting in the halting of other planned projects in Valletta and the decision to use celebrated architects (including Renzo Piano) rather than Richard England. The other projects started in 2008 when works commenced on the City Gate, the site of the former opera house, the new parliament building and the rest of the area around the city's entrance.
One of the biggest challenges that Prof. England faced was that of increasing accessibility in a building created to repel invaders. This necessitated major structural intervention and very difficult decisions about which areas should, and must, undergo such drastic intervention.
This task was carried off with great aplomb in the conversion of the two water cisterns, one into St James' spectacular theatre space and the other into the atrium. A stunning, unifying space which provides access to the upper galleries. the design nonetheless incorporate glass panels and a marvelous awareness of space that allows the visitor to read the historical narrative told by the wells.
The work was carried out in collaboration with the restoration expert Michael Ellul. With and emphasis that firmly discouraged the use of replica and imitation. Hence anything that looks 16th century is 16th century and anything that looks contemporary is contemporary. The national heritage organization Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna did protest against the removal of a rare World War Two gas shelter and other historical remains from the British period.
This theme is particularly obvious on the ground floor. In the Music Room, the British-installed ceiling has been removed, and the room restored to its original state. The gift shop, on the other hand, is split. In other halls partial removal of the ceiling has allowed both periods to be represented in this modern interpretation of a deeply historical building.
Restoration of the cavalier was complete by the end of summer 2000, and it opened to the public as St James Cavalier, Centre for Creativity on 22 September of that year, with an exhibition entitled "Art in Malta Today". The cavalier now houses a small theatre, a cinema, music rooms and art galleries. Since it was opened it has welcomed over a million visitors. In August 2015, the cavalier was re-branded as Spazju Kreattiv (Maltese for "Creative Space"). Its artistic director is Toni Sant. Various exhibitions and other cultural events are regularly held there including a yearly festival by the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology.
The cavalier is scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.
Architecture.
St James Cavalier is a large casemated artillery platform having a pentagonal plan. The structure was not designed with aesthetics in mind, highlighting its purely utilitarian military function. Despite the impression of size given by the external aspect of the building, half of the structure was filled with compressed earth and the rest consisted of a series of sparse chambers and a ramp by which cannons could reach the roof.
The cavalier occupies the rear face of St James' Bastion, and it was meant to be able to fire over the bastion's main parapet, without interfering with its fire. A number of gunpowder magazines are located to the rear of the structure.

GTR (album)

GTR is the only album from the short-lived supergroup GTR, released in April 1986. The album peaked at No. 11 on the "Billboard" 200 chart, and the single "When the Heart Rules the Mind" reached No. 14 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 singles chart. Another single, "The Hunter", peaked at No. 85. In the UK, the album was released on 7 July 1986, where it reached No. 41 on the album charts.
An instrumental piece recorded by GTR guitarist Steve Howe years before, "Sketches in the Sun", was included on the album due to a shortage of content. It resurfaced on his solo album "Motif Volume 1" and again on his "Anthology" album. Steve Hackett's "Hackett to Bits" was a simplified version of the title track from his "Please Don't Touch" album. (It has no connection with the similarly titled "Hackett to Pieces" from "Highly Strung".) Asia recorded their own version of the Geoff Downes-penned "The Hunter" for their 1997 compilation album "Anthology".
The group, founded by Hackett and Howe, disbanded in 1987. Downes, who like Howe had been a member of Yes and Asia, produced the album.
The band's name, anecdotally, comes from the marking on the studio mixing console that indicates the 'guitar' volume control.
The album was reissued in 2001 as a remastered CD and again in 2006 as a Japanese mini-LP CD, but otherwise remained out of print until a deluxe 2-CD version was released in 2015.
Reception.
Paul Stump, in his "History of Progressive Rock", said the album "managed to make two of the most distinctive guitarists in rock sound like autopiloted sessioneers at a Foreigner recording."
A retrospective review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine in "Allmusic" agreed that the album "didn't deliver the fireworks that Howe and Hackett fans desired. Part of the problem is that the two guitarists crowd each other out; it rarely sounds like they're trading licks, but rather like they're stepping forward for solos at their pre-scheduled times." He praised the hit single as "anthemic, professional stadium rock at its best" but said the rest of the album feels like a missed opportunity.
"Musician" reviewer J. D. Considine wrote simply: "SHT."

Battersea South (UK Parliament constituency)

Battersea South was a parliamentary constituency, originally in the County of London and later in Greater London. It returned one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the UK Parliament (using first-past-the-post voting).
It was created for the 1918 general election, when the former Battersea constituency was divided in two and the Clapham constituency was reduced in size, losing both of its Battersea wards of the four in total. Battersea South was abolished for the 1983 general election, when the bulk of its territory was reunited with Battersea North to form a new Battersea seat. The south of its area formed a new Tooting seat.
Boundaries.
The seat was created by the Representation of the People Act 1918. When seats were redistributed by the Representation of the People Act 1948 the boundaries of the constituency were altered to contain only four wards, and Winstanley ward was transferred to Battersea North. However the wards of the borough were redrawn in 1949 prior to the next general election in 1950. Accordingly, changes were made under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949. Of the 16 new wards, eight were included in each of the Battersea North and South constituencies.
In 1965 Battersea became part of the London Borough of Wandsworth. This, however made no immediate change to the parliamentary constituencies. It was not until the general election of February 1974 that the constituency boundaries were altered. The Shaftesbury and St John's wards were transferred to Battersea North, while the redrawn constituency incorporated areas previously in the Clapham and Putney seats. These boundaries were used until abolition.
The constituency was abolished in 1983. Most of its area (Balham, Fairfield and Northcote wards) went to the recreated Battersea seat, with part (Earlsfield and Nightingale wards) passing to Tooting.
Election results.
Election in the 1910s.
 Jenkin was supported by and possibly the nominee of the local National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers branch.

John Paul Jones (film)

John Paul Jones is a 1959 biographical adventure film from Warner Bros. Pictures, filmed in the Technirama process, about the American Revolutionary War naval hero. The film, shot in Denia, Spain, was produced by Samuel Bronston and directed by John Farrow, from a screenplay by John Farrow, Ben Hecht, and Jesse Lasky Jr. The film is based on the story "Nor'wester" by Clements Ripley. The music score was by Max Steiner and the cinematography was by Michel Kelber. It was the final film directed by Farrow.
The film stars Robert Stack (in the title role), Marisa Pavan, Charles Coburn, Macdonald Carey, Jean-Pierre Aumont, David Farrar, Peter Cushing, Basil Sydney, and Thomas Gomez. The director's daughter and son Mia Farrow and John Charles Farrow also make their feature film debuts. Bette Davis made a cameo appearance as Empress Catherine the Great.
Plot.
A United States Navy officer recounts the life of John Paul Jones to new midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy. In 1759, a young John Paul undergoes an apprenticeship onboard a merchantman, serving on several ships and becoming the master of his own ship by 1773. In Tobago, a mutinous subordinate challenges Paul, who kills him; the governor of Tobago, not wanting him arrested, advises Paul to go to Virginia, where his brother lives. Paul agrees, changing his name to "John Paul Jones" to disguise himself. After arriving in Fredericksburg, Jones finds his brother has recently dead and left his estate, including two slaves Scipio and Cato, to him. As Jones is opposed to slavery, he frees the duo, who continue to work for him. Jones also retains the services of his brother's attorney Patrick Henry. Jones shares Henry's hostility towards British rule in the American colonies, but finds himself torn between their friendship and his romantic feelings for Henry's love interest Dorothea. The will of Jones' brother required him to settle down as a father, but Jones finds himself ill-suited for the profession, and having been rejected by Dorothea's father for her hand in marriage decide to return to sea.
The American Revolutionary War begins, and Jones is commissioned into the Continental Navy, leading a successful raid of Nassau despite his superiors' misgivings. Reuniting with Scipio and Cato, he goes on a cruise and captures eighteen British ships loaded with valuable supplies. Despite his successes, Jones is denied from further promotions due to his low social status, and goes to Valley Forge to tender his resignation. There, General George Washington points out the desperate circumstances of his troops and persuades Jones to go to France and assist Benjamin Franklin in enlisting them as allies. In France, Jones is feted as a hero and at Franklin's urging takes command of a former Dutch frigate. With the ship, he raids the English coast, attacking the town of Whitehaven but treating its population well. Once again, Jones' success is undercut by political rivalries, and his ship is taken from him. Jones falls in love with French lady-in-waiting Aimee de Telleson, and with Franklin's help they persuade Louis XVI to build a new ship for Jones under the American flag, which is named "Bonhomme Richard". 
Commanding the ship, he fights against the British frigate "Serapis". Though "Bonhomme Richard" is heavily damaged, Jones continues to fight on, telling British Captain Richard Pearson "I have not yet begun to fight!". Jones and his men overpower "Serapis"s crew and force Pearson to surrender even as Jones' own ship sinks. Taking command of "Serapis", Jones returns to France, where he is unable to pursue his romance with Aimee due against to his low social status. When the Revolutionary War ends in 1783, Jones' career comes to an end due to the disbandment of the Continental Navy. He proceeds to join the Imperial Russian Navy after responding to a request from Catherine the Great. Surrounded by sycophantic nobles, Catherine tests Jones' resolve and finds him withstanding the temptations of court life. She gives him command of the Black Sea Fleet, which Jones leads to victory over the Ottoman Navy during the Russo-Turkish War. Given a title of nobility, Jones returns to Paris and reunites with Aimee, but becomes seriously ill; as he lies dying, Aimee writes down a letter Jones composes listing the qualities that naval officers should have. The final scene returns 1959 at the U.S. Naval Academy, where the narrating officer concludes with remarks about Jones' legacy.
Production.
Development.
During the 1930s, numerous American film studios attempted to make biopics about John Paul Jones, but abandoned their projects due to the heavy cost and long length of the projects. In March 1939, Warner Bros. Pictures had purchased the screen rights to Clements Ripley's biographical novel about John Paul Jones, with Aeneas MacKenzie hired to write the script. James Cagney was attached to portray the title role, with Michael Curtiz directing and William Cagney producing. Cagney was later replaced as producer with Lou Edelman. In November of the same year, the project was postponed, with Cagney instead starring in "City for Conquest" (1940).
In 1946, independent producer Samuel Bronston announced that he had obtained the cooperation of the U.S. Navy for the making of his own biopic of John Paul Jones. It took Bronston nine years to eventually find the financing for the project. In December 1955, Bronston announced that he had formed Admiralty Pictures Corporation, consisting of a group of New York investors, and that they had made a deal with Warner Bros. to produce their long dormant "Call to Action" project. Bronson hired Jesse Lasky, Jr. to writing the script and Bronston wanted John Wayne to star. Bronston's studio received investment from numerous American entrepreneurs and corporations including the Rockefeller family, the Dana family, the Du Pont family, the Stern family, Ernest A. Gross, General Motors, Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, Time Inc., and Eastman Kodak so that they could retrieve funds frozen from sales in Europe. In January 1956, Bronston stated that Admiral Chester Nimitz would act as his personal adviser on the film, in which production was to begin in May of that year.
In 1956, Lasky completed the script with consultation from U.S. Navy officials. In May 1956, Bronston announced that Glenn Ford had accepted the title role. Later, in July, William Dieterle had signed to direct the project, in which filming was scheduled for August. Dieterle favored Richard Todd and Richard Basehart for the role of Jones and John Miljan for George Washington, and hired Ben Hecht to write a new version of the script. By September, Basehart had been cast after Bronston had screen tested 38 actors for the title role. The film would be shot in Warner Bros.' studio and off the Italian coast.
In October 1956, Bronston signed a contract to shoot the feature in the Todd-AO process. However, production was pushed back as Warner Bros. had withdrawn from the project. In October 1957, John Farrow had signed on to direct the film with shooting being re-located to Spain.
Bronston had Uruguayan Jaime Prades as his representative in Spain.
Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco was the Spanish minister of the presidency and an admirer of Nimitz's.
He was convinced to supply Spanish Navy personnel as extras.
Farrow liked Lasky's script but rewrote it himself since he was unavailable to collaborate on further edits. Farrow initially received sole credit for writing but ultimately shared it with Lasky after he complained to the Writers Guild of America. Two months later, it was reported that the Navy re-affirmed its full cooperation and that Warner Bros. had re-signed on as the distributor. In February 1958, Robert Stack would play the title role. The film was financed in part through using frozen assets in Spain.
Filming.
Filming started January 1958 in France and ended in August in Spain. There were 107 speaking parts and a shooting schedule of 92 days. Most of the unit was based at Denia. The Spanish government allowed filming at the throne room of the Royal Palace in Madrid. There were also scenes shot in Scotland and Ostia.
Reception.
Bosley Crowther of "The New York Times" wrote the film was "an unexciting picture, so far as dramatic action is concerned, and utterly unexpressive of the recorded nature and character of John Paul Jones." He was dismissive of Stack's performance noting his portrayal was "as though he were a slightly dull but talkative member of a conservative gentleman's club". James Powers of "Variety" was similarly critical, noting the film "could be shortened drastically and tightened to give it better pace and emphasis. The strong portions would then show to better advantage and eliminate the drag of unnecessary plotting." Powers also felt the depicted historical figures "tended to be stiff or unbelievable" because the film "doesn't get much fire-power into the characters. They end, as they begin, as historical personages rather than human being." "Harrison's Reports" wrote the film "is excellent from the production point of view. It is, however, only moderately satisfying as an entertainment, for it is handicapped by a script that is something less than inspiring."
The film was a box office failure, losing $5 million. Bronston, however, managed to raise financing from many of the same investors, notably Pierre S. du Pont III, for his later features.
Legacy.
Musician John Paul Jones (born John Baldwin), best known as the bassist of English rock band Led Zeppelin, took his stage name at the suggestion of Andrew Loog Oldham, who had seen the film's poster.
Despite the financial failure of "John Paul Jones", Bronston continued to produce a number of historical epic films, in which he had established Spain as a major production center in filmmaking. However, Bronston would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 1964 following another financial failure with "The Fall of the Roman Empire".

Diario Co Latino

Diario Co Latino is an alternative newspaper, published in San Salvador, El Salvador. The editorial team is currently headed by Francisco E. Valencia.
History.
The newspaper was founded November 5, 1890 by intellectual and journalist Miguel Pinto. Originally named "Siglo XX" (20th Century), it was soon renamed "El Latinoamericano". After the editorial was destroyed by fire, the newspaper was revived under a new name of "Diario Latino".
During the regime of the General Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez, the newspaper was attacked and threatened by the military. Later the editorial was registered as "Propiedad de Editora Salvadoreña de Periódicos, Revistas y Publicidad".
After the death of Miguel Pinto, his son, Miguel Angel Pinto, took charge of the newspaper and changed its format to tabloid. Like other newspapers of El Salvador founded in the 19th century by wealthy businessman, Diario Latino was conservative. After the death of Miguel Pinto, his son Miguel Angel Pinto sold the editorial to “H” Corporation of Adolfo Rey Prendes, who served as Minister of Culture and Communication in the government of Napoleón Duarte. Rey sold his shares on the company to the well known journalist Eduardo Vazquez Becker, but the newspaper has been negotiated by Arena's president Alfredo Cristiani with FMLN. Diario Latino declared bankruptcy and was sequestered by Banco de Crédito Popular which passed it to the Fondo de Saneamiento y Fortalecimiento Financiero (FOSAFFI), an organ created by the Banco Central de Reserva.
In June 1989 its employees stopped receiving their pays, decided to organize and formed a union which took over operations, changing its name to "Diario Co Latino". Its editorial line suffered a drastic change, from right-wing to a left-wing paper, becoming the most prominent left wing newspaper.
In February 1991 it suffered a terrorist attack by a right wing group, which set it on fire. The building was rebuilt by students from Universidad Nacional de El Salvador, with the help of loans and gifts from various organizations such as Oxfam or the Organización Internacional de Periodistas (OIP).
Its previous owner, Eduardo Vazquez-Becker, began editing a newspaper in 2009, naming it "Diario Latino".
Reputation.
In 2010, the Diario Co Latino won the Spanish Freedom of Expression Prize from the for writing investigative articles during El Salvador's civil war.

Germany men's national field hockey team

The Germany men's national field hockey team is one of the most successful sides in the world, winning gold at the Summer Olympics four times (including once as West Germany), the Hockey World Cup 3 times, the EuroHockey Nations Championship eight times (including twice as West Germany) and the Hockey Champions Trophy ten times (including three times as West Germany).
History.
The team caused an upset in the 2002 Men's Hockey World Cup when they defeated Australia 2–1 with striker Olivier Domke scoring the winner after Germany came back from being 1–0 down. After this period the Germans went through a transition period, finishing lowly in the 2003 Men's Hockey Champions Trophy and the 2004 Men's Hockey Champions Trophy with several inexperienced players in their squad. Coach Bernhard Peters was looking to nurture the players for the World Cup such as Christopher Zeller, Moritz Fürste and Timo Wess, and was successful as the Germans won the 2006 Men's Hockey World Cup in Mönchengladbach, defeating Australia 4–3 in the final. Bernhard Peters left the team in order to pursue a career in football and is now a staff member at TSG 1899 Hoffenheim.
On 6 November 2006, Markus Wiese was appointed as the new head coach. Success at the 2007 Men's Hockey Champions Trophy and a gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics followed this. Germany headed into the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup with a largely young and inexperienced squad but reached the final of the World Cup after strong performances throughout the tournament. In the final, they were defeated 2–1 by Australia.
Germany has played in the annual 2011 Hockey Champions Trophy held in Auckland, New Zealand. The team competed in pool B with Korea, Netherlands and host nation New Zealand. The team finished fifth in the tournament.

Dimitris Tsaloumas

Dimitris Tsaloumas (13 October 1921 – 4 February 2016) was a Greek-Australian poet.
Biography.
Tsaloumas was born in Greece on the island of Leros, one of the Dodecanese islands, which were then under Italian rule (from 1912 to 1947). Consequently, his formal education was in Italian. His later schooling was on Rhodes, where he also studied the violin. He came of age during the Italian and German occupation of Greece, and took part in the resistance, acting as a courier. In Greece, before migrating to Australia, he published two collections of poetry, one of which was printed with the help of the English writer Lawrence Durrell, who met Tsaloumas on Rhodes and was impressed with his work.
He left for Australia in 1952 because of political persecution and earned a living by teaching. He started writing again (in Greek) and had several volumes published. He became known to English readers when a selection of his Greek poems was published in the bilingual edition of "The Observatory" in 1983. The first poems he wrote entirely in English were published in 1988 in "Falcon Drinking". After that he published several more volumes of English-language poetry. He often returned to Greece, spending much of his time on Leros.
Among the prizes he has received for his writing are the National Book Council Award (1983), the Patrick White Award (1994) and an Emeritus Award from the Literature Board of the Australia Council for outstanding and lifelong contribution to Australian literature (2002). Four of Tsaloumas' poems, "I Took the Path to the Mountain", "The Foreigner", "The Pomegranate", and "Letters Bearing Bad Tidings", were set to music by the Greek-Australian songwriter Costas Tsicaderis. The latter two were published in 1985 on "Live at The Boite". A studio version of "The Pomegranate" was included in the anthology of Greek Australian songs and music "In a Strange Land". "I Took the Path to the Mountain" and "The Foreigner" is on the album by Irine Vela and Costas Tsicaderis, "Greek 3CR".

List of county routes in Westchester County, New York

County routes in Westchester County, New York, are maintained by the Westchester County highway department. They provide additional interconnections between state highways within the county. Some portions of state highways in Lower Westchester County are county-maintained and thus also carry county route designations. Additionally, actions relating to planning and zoning along some former county roads are still subject to review by the Westchester County Planning Board, and these roads still carry their county route numbers for inventory purposes. The vast majority (if not all) of county routes in Westchester County are unsigned.

Direct mail fundraising

Direct mail fundraising is a form of direct marketing widely used by nonprofit organizations in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia-Pacific to acquire new donors or members and retain the level of their contributions or dues as part of a fundraising program.
The professional use of direct mail fundraising requires an understanding both of the principles and practice of direct marketing and of the discipline of fundraising. In direct marketing, practitioners view large numbers of prospects or donors through the lens of statistics. Fundraising teaches us how to view prospects or donors as individuals, with unique values, beliefs, and preferences.
History and growth in the United States.
In its modern form, direct mail fundraising appeared in the United States after World War II, when nationwide charities such as the National Easter Seal Society sought ways to broaden their fundraising base.
It was only with the advent in the 1960s of the ZIP Code and, later, the computer that direct mail fundraising began to gain wide use. Before the ZIP Code, it was difficult to target appropriate recipients of direct mail fundraising appeals, and before the computer, compiling and maintaining lists of supporters was tedious and costly. During the 1970s, when computers became increasingly affordable, the use of direct mail fundraising spread widely. It quickly became the means by which most Americans learned about and first provided financial support for their charities of choice.
The explosive growth of the nonprofit sector in the United States — quadrupling in the 1980s and doubling again in the 1990s and early 2000s — led to a massive expansion in the use of direct mail to build and sustain large, nationwide donor and membership lists. Today, direct mail fundraising accounts for at least one-fifth of the more than $250 billion contributed annually in the U.S. to the nation's 1.6 million nonprofit organizations. 
Direct mail fundraising has its own unique jargon, much of it related to the art and science of creating, producing and mailing the right appeal to the right list at the right time, and measuring the results.
In recent years, electronic communication media has been used more commonly among nonprofits. Online, email, and social media campaigns, collectively referred to as digital fundraising, have been used in coordination with direct mail fundraising. Nonprofits supplement direct mail campaigns with email blasts and social media posts, using similar messaging and visuals to tie the various communications together.
However, digital fundraising has not grown fast enough to replace direct mail for most nonprofits. In 2018, digital fundraising accounted for 8.5% percent of charitable donations in the United States.

Navigatori-class destroyer

The Navigatori class were a group of Italian destroyers built in 1928–1929 for the (Royal Italian Navy), named after Italian explorers. They fought in World War II. Just one vessel, "Nicoloso Da Recco", survived the conflict.
Design.
These ships were built for the Regia Marina as a reply to the large "contre-torpilleurs" of the "Jaguar" and classes built for the French Navy. These ships were significantly larger than other contemporary Italian destroyers and were initially classed as "esploratori" or scouts. They were re-rated as destroyers in 1938.
The main armament was a new model /50 gun in three twin turrets which allowed for 45° elevation. The torpedo launchers consisted of two triple banks, each unusually comprising two separated by one . Two rangefinder positions were provided; one above the bridge and one in the after superstructure.
Unit machinery was used comprising four boilers in two widely spaced boiler rooms and two turbine rooms. The forward unit drove the port shaft and the aft unit drove the starboard shaft. Trials were run light and with overloaded machinery leading to speeds of up to which were not achievable under service conditions.
The ships were fast, but were found to lack stability and were rebuilt with clipper bows, increased beam and reduced superstructure in the late 1930s.
During the war the torpedoes were replaced by triple 21-inch tubes and extra anti-aircraft guns were added.

<doc id="7032672" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7032672" title="Great Cockup">
Great Cockup

Great Cockup is a fell in the northern region of the English Lake District, one of the four Uldale Fells (the others being Longlands Fell, Great Sca Fell and Meal Fell).
Description.
Great Cockup reaches a height of and merits a chapter in Alfred Wainwright's "Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells". Wainwright describes the fell as functional rather than ornamental, writing:
"Viewed from a distance Great Cockup appears as a modest but extensive eminence with no obvious summit and nothing calling for closer inspection. First impressions are confirmed by a tour of exploration, the fell underfoot proving no more attractive than the fell at a distance."
Etymology.
The fell's name may mean "blind valley frequented by wild birds", from Old English "cocc hop". If this is the case, it would originally have referred to a valley below before being transferred to the hill. The prefix "great" distinguishes the fell from its smaller neighbour Little Cockup, which lies on its north-western shoulder overlooking the hamlet of Orthwaite, with a height of .
The word "cockup" denotes a blunder in colloquial English; this prompted Denis Norden to visit the fell in an edition of "It'll be Alright on the Night", a programme featuring outtakes from film and television. The fell's name has also been adopted for a local beer brewed by the Hesket Newmarket Brewery, "Great Cockup Porter".
Topography.
The fell has a series of stone-built grouse butts west of the summit, some of which have been dismantled leaving just the foundations in the ground; they can confuse walkers as to their original purpose. The lower southern slope of the fell has a large, isolated boulder which is marked on large-scale maps; this is thought to be an erratic left by a retreating glacier. The fell has also yielded some rare fossils with unusual forms of dendroid graptolites being found on the slopes.
Ascent.
Great Cockup is almost always ascended from the hamlet of Orthwaite following the bridleway up Hause Gill for and then leaving it and ascending Great Cockup's steep southern slopes to the summit. A direct ascent over Little Cockup is possible but the bracken can be thick at certain times of the year. Great Cockup is separated from Meal Fell, to the east, by the pass of Trusmadoor.
Summit.
The view from the summit is dominated by a good view of Skiddaw's northern slopes while there is an excellent open outlook towards the Scottish Borders.
In popular culture.
On 12 October 1996 Denis Norden presented the TV show "It'll Be Alright on the Night" in episode 15 "Alright on the Night's Cockup Trip". This decision was made as the name of the hill references the theme and content of "It'll Be Alright on the Night", which is mistakes made in TV shows.
On 21 December 2020, YouTuber Tom Scott posted a video where he hiked Great Cockup whilst he gave a monologue to camera, in homage to the aforementioned TV show's title sequence which took place on the hill.

Released in 2001, it was only available on King's website, since he was not signed to a label at the time. The album consists of 19 tracks, one of which contains vocals by King "(Ashes)", and another a violin solo "(Ashokan Farewell)" playing by King's close friend Linh Renken. The album is composed of tracks which are all imbued with King's renowned percussive acoustic style consisting of elements of Flamenco, Jazz, Celtic, Classical and African music. Some of the tracks such as "Seville" and "Taps" involve the playing of cultural percussive instruments such as the Tabla and Djembe drums played by childhood friend James West, also the former drummer for King's current band. The album was recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios; King's own studio, Blackberry Hill Studio, was not yet constructed. King uses a variety of guitars on the album which include seven string, classical, steel string, and flamenco.

Jules de Koenigswarter

Baron Jules Adolphe de Kœnigswarter ("also" Königswarter) (7 March 1904 – 15 February 1995), was a French soldier and diplomat of Jewish descent.
Early life.
Koenigswarter was born on 7 March 1904 at 22 Rue Galilée in Paris into a large and prominent Königswarter family. He was the son of French banker Baron Louis de Koenigswarter (1870–1931) and Jeanne Thècle (née Kauffmann) de Koenigswarter. His younger sister, Marguerite de Koenigswarter, was married to André Gustave Bicart-Sée.
The Koenigswarter barony had been created in 1870 by Emperor Napoleon III for his great-grandfather, Louis-Jean Koenigswarter, Deputy for the Seine. His paternal grandparents were Jules Louis Maximilien Koenigswarter (son of ) and Angelica Lea (née Franchetti) Koenigswarter, who was born in Livorno, Italy. One aunt, Alice de Kœnigswarter, was married to composer Fernand Halphen, and another aunt, Hélène Joséphine Koenigswarter, was married to publisher Gaston Calmann-Lévy and, after their divorce, Marie Charles Arnaud Reynard Gilbert, Comte de Choiseul-Praslin. His cousin, Robert Calmann-Lévy, also married into the Rothschild family when he married Jacqueline de Rothschild in July 1930.
Career.
He studied at the École des Mines de Paris, becoming a civil engineer. At the outbreak of World War II, Koenigswarter joined the Free French Forces, and led troops in Africa and Europe. During the war, his children Patrick and Janka stayed with the Guggenheim family on Long Island. Much of his extended family perished in the Holocaust, including his mother, who dismissed his entreaties and instructions to escape and was murdered at Auschwitz. For his efforts during the war, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre, the Companion of the Liberation, and was made a Commandeur de la Légion d'honneur.
After the war, he entered the French diplomatic service, first settling with his wife and children in Norway and then in Mexico City (where he was counselor of the French Embassy), before coming to the United States in 1953 as agent general of the French government tourist office in North America. They separated in 1951 and, from 1953 to 1957, he held the position of French Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States and to Canada. In 1957, he became the French Ambassador to Indonesia, followed by the Ambassador to Peru from 1961 to 1966.
Koenigswarter later returned to Paris and a position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Upon his retirement, he moved to Spain where he died in 1995.
Personal life.
On 20 October 1930, Koenigswarter was married to Nadine Lise Raphäel (1911–1932), a daughter of Jenny (née Cahn) Raphäel and Maurice Raphäel, a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur. Through her aunt Flora Raphäel, (the wife of banker David David-Weill, who was chairman of Lazard Frères), she was a first cousin of Pierre David-Weill and Jean David-Weill. They were the parents of one child before Nadine died on 13 May 1932, just twenty years old.
On 15 October 1935, he was married to Kathleen Annie Pannonica "Nica" Rothschild, the youngest child of the late Charles Rothschild (a son of the 1st Baron Rothschild) and Rózsika Edle (née von Wertheimstein) Rothschild. In 1937, they bought and moved to the Château d'Abondant, a 17th century Château in north-west France they acquired from the family of American banker Henry Herman Harjes (who had acquired the château in 1920 from the Duchesse de Vallombrosa). Together, they were the parents of:
Jules and Nica separated in 1951 and after saxophonist Charlie Parker died at her apartment in the Stanhope Hotel in 1955, Koenigswarter filed for divorce, which was granted in 1956 along with custody of their three minor children. Nica continued to live on her own in New York City, where she was a patroness of the Bebop jazz community.
On 15 March 1956, Baron de Koenigswarter was married to Madeleine Adrienne Emma Le Forestier in New York City. His second wife died in 1988. Baron de Koenigswarter died on 15 February 1995 in Málaga, Spain.

From Me to U

From Me to U is the debut studio album by American rapper Juelz Santana. The album was released on August 19, 2003 as planned, under Diplomat, Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam. The album was seen as the introspective introduction of the rapper to mainstream entertainment. Following appearances on various street mixtapes and the success of The Diplomats, Santana was the second member of the group to release a solo album, after de facto leader Cam'ron.
"From Me to U" was the second official album to be released while the super group was signed to Diplomat Records, a sublabel of Roc-A-Fella Records at the time, following Cam'ron's Roc-A-Fella debut "Come Home with Me". Upon its release in 2003, after one year of recording and mastering, the 20-tracked album found commercial success, reaching #8 on the "Billboard" 200 and #3 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, even though the album received generally negative reviews by critics. Though some tracks originally were featured on Juelz's street mixtape "Final Destination", they were still applied to the track listing of the official album as well.
Commercial performance.
The album debuted at number 8 on the "Billboard" 200 selling 74,000 copies in its first week. The album has sold 330,000 copies as of 2005.

Wrap dress

"Wrap dress" is a generic term for a dress with a front closure formed by wrapping one side across the other, and is fastened at the side or tied at the back. This forms a V-shaped neckline. A faux wrap dress resembles this design, except that it comes already fastened together with no opening in front, but instead is slipped on over the head. A wrap top is a top cut and constructed in the same way as a wrap dress, but without a skirt. The design of wrap-style closure in European garments was the results of the heavy influences of Orientalism which was popular in the 19th century. 
History.
Wrap-over neckline which closes to the right side originated in China and can be traced back to the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 B.C) before spreading to other countries (such as Korea and Japan) while wrap-over neckline which closes to the left were basic styles of garments which were widely used in Central Asia and East Asia, as well as Europe, from West Asia. 
East Asia.
China.
The traditional clothing of the Han Chinese, , are traditionally loose, wrap-style garments; these include wrap-style robes, such as the (which sews a top and a skirt to form a dress), the , the , and the (a one-piece dress), etc., as well as wrap-style upper garments, such as the and , etc., and as short-sleeved or sleeveless wrap-style upper garment such as and , etc. The Chinese wrap-over neckline typically closes on the right side like the alphabetic letter《y》and is referred as () but can occasionally close on the left side under some circumstances in a style known as ().
Japan.
The was adopted by the Japanese in 718 AD through the Yoro Code which stipulated that all robes had to be closed from the left to the right in a typical Chinese way.
Wrap-style garments which were tied with sash have very ancient origins in China and were later introduced in Japan influencing the design of the . The originated from the Chinese , which gained popularity in the 8th-century Japanese court.
Orientalism, Europe, and America.
European clothing with wrap-style closure were heavily influenced by the popularity of Orientalism in the 19th century. In the 20th century, Chinoiserie in fashion gained popularity and impacted many fashion designers of the time, including fashion designed based in the United States. According to the "Ladies’ Home Journal" of June 1913, volume 30, issue 6:Chinoiserie continued to be popular in the 1920s and was a major influence in the dress feature and fashion design of this period; simultaneously, Japonisme also had a profound impact by influencing new forms of clothing designs of this period; for example, the use of wrap top and obi-like sash as an influence of the Japanese .
During the Great Depression, house dresses called "Hooverettes" were popular which employed a wrap design. Wrap dresses were designed by Elsa Schiaparelli in the 1930s and by Claire McCardell in the 1940s, whose original 'popover' design, which was made out of denim, became the basis for a variety of wrap-around dresses. Fashion designer Charles James also designed a wrap dress.
In the early 1970s, Orientalism re-emerged as the West officially expressed eagerness towards the Far East. Oriental fashion, thus, re-surfaced in American fashion wear; American designers also showed these Oriental influences in their creation designs. The wrap-around lounging wear, which was inspired by the native Chinese dress, gained popularity among women during this period.
Diane von Fürstenberg's wrap dress.
Although it is often claimed that Diane von Fürstenberg 'invented' what is known as the wrap dress in 1972/73, Richard Martin, a former curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, noted that the form of Fürstenberg's design had already been "deeply embedded into the American designer sportswear tradition," with her choice of elastic, synthetic fabrics distinguishing her work from earlier wrap dresses. Her design is actually a two-pieces dress where a wrap top is sewn to a skirt, similar to the making of the Chinese shenyi.
The Fürstenberg interpretation of the wrap dress, which was consistently knee-length, in a clinging jersey, with long sleeves, was so popular and so distinctive that the style has generally become associated with her. She has stated that her divorce inspired the design, and also suggested it was created in the spirit of enabling women to enjoy sexual freedom. The wrap dress that she designed in 1974 was a design re-interpretation of the . 
Wrap dresses achieved their peak of popularity in the mid to late 1970s, and the design, essentially a robe, has been credited with becoming a symbol of women's liberation in the 1970s. They experienced renewed popularity beginning in the late 1990s, particularly after von Fürstenberg reintroduced her wrap dress in 1997; she, among others, has continued to design wrap dresses since then. André Leon Talley published a 2004 book dedicated entirely to Fürstenberg's wrap dresses. The popularity of the wrap dress and its perceived feminist significance persisted into the 2010s.

Fred. Olsen Express

Fred. Olsen Express is an inter-island ferry service based in the Canary Islands, Spain. It operates a fleet of six modern fast ferries on five routes. Its fleet includes a trimaran fast ferry, the Benchijigua Express, which was the first such vehicle in the world when it entered service in 2005. The company is owned by the Olsen family-controlled Bonheur and Ganger Rolf, which among other things also owns the shipping companies Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines and First Olsen Tankers.
History.
Fred. Olsen Express was founded in 1974 as Ferry Gomera, S.A. The first sailing took place July 8, 1974, when a ferry set sail from the Gomeran capital of San Sebastian de La Gomera for the town of Los Cristianos in Tenerife. The first ferry to operate the route was christened the "Benchijigua", which is named after a small village located in the south of La Gomera. It also was in keeping with a long tradition of Fred. Olsen which was that all name of the company's ships should begin with the letter B.
Until this first sailing the island of La Gomera had practically been isolated and was only ever visited by a single boat which came to collect bananas and tomatoes, that the island produced for export to Europe, and in return dropped off supplies for the island. It was the opening of this first route by Fred Olsen that really brought about changes for the Gomerans.
The route between La Gomera and Tenerife initially operated three times a day in each direction and took 80 minutes, and was capable of handling 400 passengers and around 60 cars. As a gesture of goodwill a free coach was provided from Los Cristianos in the South of Tenerife to the capital Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Five years after the launch of the service a new larger and faster ferry was added, the "Bonanza". The ship had previously been served with the company in Northern Europe, but was transferred to the Gomera route. Then again in 1989 still trading as Ferry Gomera the company introduced a route from Los Cristianos to San Sebastian de La Gomera using a ferry named the "SES Sant’ Agata" (later the "Gomera Express") which was promoted as "fast and comfortable". The crossing took only 35 minutes. Also in 1989 a route was established between Playa Blanca, Lanzarote and Corralejo, Fuerteventura which was operated by the ferry "Betancuria".
The route had also carried nearly 900 patients as well as 20 additional critical emergency crossings. In 1994 Fred. Olsen signed a deal with the Canarian Postal Service to offer an on-board post office on board the Benchijigua Express. A fourth daily service was also added. The year 2000 saw the entry of the "Benchijigua Express" on the Gomera route. In 2005, a brand new trimaran, also named "Benchijigua Express" entered service on the Tenerife to La Gomera and Tenerife to La Palma route. The old "Benchijigua Express" was renamed "Bentago Express" and placed on the Santa Cruz de Tenerife to Gran Canaria route.
Fleet.
The company currently operates six large fast ferries, all built by the two Australian companies that dominate the fast ferry market: three by Austal of Perth and the other three by Incat shipyards in Hobart. In addition, a smaller ferry operates locally on La Gomera.
"Benchijigua Express".
The HSC "Benchijigua Express" is a long fast trimaran, operated by the company between Los Cristianos in Tenerife, San Sebastián de La Gomera and Santa Cruz de La Palma. It was delivered to Olsen in April 2005 by Australian shipbuilding giant Austal.
"Bencomo Express" and "Bentago Express".
The HSC "Bentago Express" and HSC "Bencomo Express" are fast catamarans built by Incat in Hobart, Tasmania. Both were delivered to Olsen in the late 1990s / early 2000s. They are operated by the company between Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Agaete "(Puerto de las Nieves)" in Gran Canaria.
"Bocayna Express".
The HSC "Bocayna Express" is a fast catamaran, making it the smallest in the current fleet of inter-island ferries. It is operated by the company between Playa Blanca in Lanzarote and Corralejo in Fuerteventura, across La Bocayna strait. The ferry has operated the 15-minute crossing since 2003 when it was delivered by Australian shipbuilder Austal. It is one of the three ferries in the fleet made by Austal.
"Bonanza Express".
The HSC "Bonanza Express" is a Incat fast catamaran, similar to the "Bentago Express" and the "Bencomo Express", operated by the company on the route between Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Arrecife (Lanzarote). Introduced in 1999, it was the company's first fast ferry. The "Bonanza Express" was meant to be sold to Euroferries for a service between Ramsgate and Boulogne, but the deal fell through and the "Bonanza Express" has found its way back with Fred. Olsen Express in the Canary Islands.
"Benchi Express".
The "Benchi Express" is a catamaran with a capacity of 250 passengers used locally on the island of La Gomera to connect the island's capital, San Sebastián, with Playa Santiago and Valle Gran Rey. It was launched in June 2017 at the Drassanes Dalmau shipyard in Barcelona.
The previous "Benchi Express" was a catamaran delivered to Olsen in March 2009. Until January 2012, the ferry connected Los Cristianos in Tenerife with San Sebastián de la Gomera, then going on to connect Playa Santiago and Valle Gran Rey, both in La Gomera. The service came about following the collapse of Garajonay Express. The main crossing took 55 minutes from Los Cristianos to San Sebastián. The ferry was acquired from Italian operator SNAV. The ship was previously called SNAV "Aquila".
"Betancuria Express".
The HSC "Betancuria Express" was the world's largest high speed catamaran when it was launched, and is used by Fred. Olsen Express on the route connecting Las Palmas de Gran Canaria with the port of Morro Jable in Fuerteventura. The company bought the Austal ferry in April 2017; it was previously named HSC "Leonora Christina" and operated between Denmark and Sweden. After a charter back contract expired on 31 August 2018, the ship was renamed "Betancuria Express" and operates from Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.
Two new 117-metre trimarans.
In October 2017, five months after its competitor Naviera Armas announced the order of "Volcán de Tagoro", a 10,800 GT, 1,200 passenger Incat fast catamaran ferry for the Canaries at a price of €74 million, Fred. Olsen Express responded by ordering two trimarans from the Australian shipbuilder Austal at a price of €126 million. Each of the ships will have a capacity of 1,100 passengers and 276 cars and will be capable of reaching speeds of up to . The new ships will be named "Bajamar Express" and "Bañaderos Express".
"Barlovento Express".
On the 28th November 2024, Fred. Olsen announced the addition of the Barlovento Express from Liberty Lines, to operate the Las Palmas-Morrojable line. It formerly operated for Trasmediterránea as "Ciudad de Ceuta" and "Millenium Dos". It was built in 2003, construction 058 from Australian shipyard Incat.
Lineas Fred. Olsen.
The following ships have operated previously for Fred Olsen Express.
The company had many old slow ferries, but decided to revamp in 2000. This meant that most of the old ferries were sold on, being replaced by High Speed Catamarans and a new High Speed Trimaran.
Incidents and accidents.
The Bonanza Express ran aground in early December 2008. All 175 passengers were evacuated safely. It lost control when entering the port of Los Cristianos. The ship suffered substantial damage, but was not in danger of sinking, Fred Olsen general director Juan Ramsden said. The reason for the accident appeared to be linked to a failure of the ferry's reverse system, according to Ramsden. The ferry leaked up to three tons of fuel. The presence of cars on the deck slowed down attempts to take it to a shipyard for repairs. The Bonanza Express was planned to be in operation with Euroferries on a route between Ramsgate and Boulogne. However, although this service from Ramsgate to Boulogne was still due to start on 1 March 2010 after many delays, the Bonanza Express is now back with Fred Olsen, having been seen on the Los Cristianos webcam.

Culver Studios

The Culver Studios is a film studio in Culver City, California. Originally created by silent movie pioneer Thomas H. Ince, the studios have operated under a multitude of names: Ince Studio (1918–1925), De Mille Studios (1925–1928), Pathé Studios (1928–1931), RKO-Pathé Studios (1931–1935), Selznick International Pictures (1935–1956), Desilu-Culver Studios (1956–1970), Culver City Studios (1970–1977), and Laird International Studios (1977–1986). 
Many classics from Hollywood's Golden Age were filmed there, including "Gone with the Wind" (1939), "A Star is Born" (1937), "Intermezzo" (1939), and "Rebecca" (1940).
The Culver Studios was also used for television shows such as "The Andy Griffith Show", "Lassie", "Batman", "The Nanny", and, more recently, "Scrubs", "Arrested Development," and "Cougar Town".
Eccentric businessman Howard Hughes once had a stake in the studio as well as filmmakers Cecil B. DeMille and David O. Selznick. It was purchased, in 2014, by Hackman Capital Partners, which completely modernized the lot over the next four years, while preserving the site's historic structures. 
History"".
Ince Studio.
The Culver Studios was founded in 1918 by silent movie actor, director, and producer Thomas H. Ince after he acquired land from real estate developer Harry Culver. The Thomas H. Ince Studio, as it was originally known, was designed and constructed by the architectural firm of Meyer &amp; Holler. Ince had grand ambitions to create his own studio unique from all the others. The first building to go up on the lot was "The Mansion" - a picturesque Colonial-styled administrative building with a white facade and grand columns overlooking manicured lawns. It was modeled after George Washington's home at Mount Vernon, Virginia.
The studio became the second major motion picture concern in Culver City acquired by Amazon (MGM) Studios.
DeMille Studios.
Ince operated the studio until his early death in 1924, and the following year, his widow sold the property to Cecil B. DeMille, who renamed it DeMille Studios. DeMille ran the lot for two years, during which time the site underwent several large-scale expansions and renovations, including the construction of the DeMille theater and a replica of the streets of Jerusalem for his film "The King of Kings" (1927).
Despite a couple of major box office hits, DeMille failed to make the studio financially sustainable and merged his company with Pathé Exchange Inc. in 1928. DeMille signed a three-picture deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and the lot remained under the ownership of a conglomerate of companies.
RKO-Pathé studios.
Another merger took place in 1932, when RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) Pictures bought Pathé. To distinguish it from its Hollywood property, the site operated under the name RKO-Pathé studios. Further improvements took place and stars Bette Davis, Robert Mitchum, Cary Grant, and Katharine Hepburn all saw their careers continue to blossom while filming on the lot. Sets were also used in the original version of "King Kong" (1933).
Selznick International Pictures.
RKO rented out the lot for virtually the entirety of its ownership and seldom used the space to shoot its own productions. From 1935 to 1946, the site was leased to Selznick International Pictures, owned by David O. Selznick, and it underwent more renovations. Selznick is best remembered for being the producer of "Gone With the Wind" (1939) and entire abandoned sets on the backlot were set ablaze early in its production schedule to recreate the burning of Atlanta scenes.
After 1946, RKO-Pathé resumed operation of the site and leased the space to David O. Selznick's new Vanguard Films Inc., as well as a variety of other independent production companies. Tycoon and movie producer Howard Hughes bought the studio in 1950 and continued to lease out the space to production companies until he sold RKO Pictures to General Tire.
Desilu Studios.
Desilu Productions, owned by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, purchased the lot from General Tire for $6 million in 1957 (approximately $62 million in 2022 when adjusted for inflation) and television soon became the primary business conducted on the site.
Perfect Film &amp; Chemical Corporation purchased Desilu Studios from Gulf+Western in 1968, only to sell it to OSF Industries in 1969.
Culver Studios.
In 1970, Desilu Studios was renamed The Culver City Studios. In 1977, the studio was renamed Laird International Studios, which was a rental facility. In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 1986, the studio was purchased by GTG Entertainment, a joint venture between Grant Tinker and the Gannett Company for $24 million. GTG remodeled the studio and renamed the lot to The Culver Studios, which was acquired by Sony Pictures for $80 million in June 1991.
In April 2004, The Culver Studios was bought by a private investment group called Studio City Los Angeles for $125 million. It included Lehman Brothers, Pacific Coast Capital, and Pacifica Ventures.
In honor of its original owner, Thomas H. Ince, the street running through the middle of the studio has been named Ince Boulevard.
In March 2014, the Culver Studios was purchased by another private investment group, Hackman Capital Partners (HCP). When rumors persisted that the lot would be replaced by condominiums, HCP CEO Michael Hackman debunked those claims. However, Hackman said that the studio will be renovated to take advantage of modern technology, as well as adding extra parking and production space.
Facilities.
The Culver Studios formerly had 13 sound stages, on-site offices, a screening theatre, fitness facility, medical services, and parking.
Site development.
Throughout its history, Culver Studios continued to undergo numerous expansions and adaptations to meet the changing needs of the movie industry. The major works took place between 1918 and 1946, during the tenures of Thomas H. Ince, Cecil B. DeMille, RKO Pictures, and David O. Selznick.
Ince built the original studio, now known as The Culver Studios, on a 14-acre site. When the lot was bought by Cecil B. DeMille in 1925, large scale site renovations began. He reoriented the existing stages and moved numerous office bungalows and production service buildings. To match production needs, Stage 2 (now known as Stages 2/3/4), four new double-barrelled projection rooms, and seven new cutting rooms were added to the studio site.
In 1930, under the ownership of Pathé Exchange, the area was again renovated and redesigned. The arrival of talking pictures brought a massive new growth to Hollywood and an increased demand for movies. RKO-Pathé Studios built two large stage facilities (stages 7/8/9 and 11/12/14) and several production service buildings.
It was not until David O. Selznick's time at the helm, from 1935 to 1946, that the studios became fully built out and included new on-site bungalows. A final stage facility was built (stages 15/16) and the main studio site was developed to closely resemble the current layout.
In late 2018, Hackman Capital Partners broke ground on a $620-million expansion of The Culver Studios, which has become the new home of Amazon Studios. The expansion project added 413,000 square feet of rentable space to the 14-acre campus - increasing its total footprint to more than 720,000 square feet. Plans included two parking structures, with total accommodations for 1,930 vehicles. Amazon announced its move to The Culver Studios in late 2017. In addition, it leased the entirety of the adjacent Culver Steps development, also being built by Hackman Capital Partners. The combined 600,000 square feet of space houses Amazon subsidiaries Amazon MGM Studios, IMDb, and Amazon Prime Video.
Mansion House.
The picturesque mansion house is the centerpiece of the Culver Studios lot and has landmark status. It is a classic example of 1920s Colonial Revival architecture and was the first building to go up on the site shortly after Thomas H. Ince's acquisition of the land in 1918. Modeled after George Washington's home at Mount Vernon, Virginia, it serves as the main administrative building on the lot. Famous producers including Ince, Cecil B. DeMille, and David O. Selznick once had offices there.
One long corridor runs the length of the 15,000 square foot structure, which has eight two-story high grand white columns. The facade looks out onto a manicured lawn.
There is a common misconception that the mansion house was used as the site of Tara, the home of Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind". The building was seen in the film credits but Tara was a separate building constructed on the Forty Acres backlot by art director Lyle Wheeler, where the scene depicting the burning of Atlanta was filmed.
Bungalows.
At the southern end of Culver Studios sat a collection of four bungalows, dating back to the 1920s and 1930s. They were occupied by a host of celebrated writers and actors over the years and are now considered locally significant structures.
Alfred Hitchcock used one of the one-story buildings as his office for years. Another bungalow was built in 1935 and used as a residential space for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh during filming of "Gone With the Wind". Other bungalows have been connected to Olivia de Havilland, Lucille Ball, Gloria Swanson and Orson Welles.
As part of the expansion project undertaken by Hackman Capital Partners, the bungalows were moved to the front of the lot, behind the mansion house. They are used as production spaces and offices for writers, producers, production staff, and talent.
Cecil B. DeMille Theater.
Built by producer Cecil B. DeMille in 1927 when he owned the studio, the theater is adjacent to the mansion house. It was dedicated to DeMille in 1984 and available for special screenings, fundraisers, and production daily viewings.
The theater has 70 seats, a 24 ft x 11 ft screen, and digital and 35mm projectors.
Back Forty.
As the Culver Studios grew in size and stature, a backlot was used to build full-scale outdoor sets. The Back Forty, also known as Forty Acres, sat on a triangular plot of land a few blocks from the main lot.
It was initially leased from landowner Harry Culver during Cecil B. DeMille's tenure and was continuously used to build the plantation Tara, the Atlanta Depot, and other Atlanta buildings in "Gone With the Wind".
The Back Forty also provided the backdrop for several television shows broadcast during the 1960s, including "Hogan's Heroes", "The Andy Griffith Show", "", and "Bonanza".
The land is no longer connected to the Culver Studios and currently serves as an office park.
Productions.
Culver Studios helped spawn the career of numerous movie and television stars. In the lot's earlier days, the site was used to film Hollywood classics like Hitchcock's "Spellbound" (1945) before a plethora of television shows began to lease the stages in the 1950s to create programs like "The Andy Griffith Show" and "Hogan's Heroes".
In more recent decades, the site has again become the setting for movies including "The Matrix", "Armageddon," and "I Am Legend" while providing a home to popular television shows such as "Arrested Development" and "Cougar Town".
In 1992, Michael Jackson used the Stage to rehearse for his upcoming Dangerous Tour (1992-1993).

Gilardo Gilardi Conservatory of Music

Gilardo Gilardi Conservarory of Music (Conservatorio de Música Gilardo Gilardi) is a music conservatory in La Plata, Argentina.
Founded as "Conservatorio de Música y Arte Escénico" (Conservatory of Music and Scenic Art) on 18 May 1949, this tertiary educational institution was the brainchild of the Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera. He envisaged a modern academy of musical studies that addressed both the professional and the artistic aspects of a musician's development. Argentine law 5322, approved on 29 October 1948 and promulgated on 23 November 1948, authorised its establishment and Ginastera became its first director. In 1960 it was suggested that the conservatory should be named in Ginastera's honour but convention was against honouring a living person. Consequently, when Gilardo Gilardi died in 1967, his name was adopted by the Conservatory.
Departments reflect every speciality of the orchestra. Courses are also offered through the faculties of pianoforte, guitar, singing, organ, conducting and music education. Diplomas are awarded for all levels of teaching in the educational system of Argentina.
Facilities.
Located in the city of La Plata near Buenos Aires the Conservatory is based in the Palacio Servente, designed by the architect Reynaldo Olivieri for Sociedad Femenil Italiana (the Italian Women's Society) as an orphanage. In 1999 the orphanage closed after 65 years because it failed to meet the requirements of United Nations' international Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The restored building is on three floors with forty classrooms, a 150-seat auditorium, a recording studio, a sound laboratory, an orchestra hall, a library, a reading room, and a cafeteria. The basement contains 19 of the classrooms including the percussion department, a cloakroom, maintenance workshops, the boiler, an archive and the general office. The ground floor is the main access level with a chapel converted for the performance of chamber music, the cafeteria, two recital rooms, the library, more classrooms and the audiovisual studio. The upper floor houses the auditorium, the sound laboratory (equipped with computers, synthesizer and digital piano), recording studio, multimedia control room, more offices, a kitchen, a hall for the wind and strings orchestras, access to the terrace, and six classrooms.

Luis Aguilé

Luis María Aguilera Picca (24 February 1936 – 10 October 2009) was an Argentine singer, songwriter and actor, best known for worldwide hit song '"Cuando salí de Cuba" ("When I Left Cuba"). 
This song become the unofficial anthem for Cuban exiles. He also is the author and original singer of the Christmas song, "Ven a mi casa esta Navidad" ("Come to My House This Christmas"), later recorded by such artists as Lucero and Verónica Castro.
Biography.
He was born in Buenos Aires, and started his career in Argentina, where he distinguished himself as a brilliant showman. He later moved to Spain in 1963, where he had a successful musical career, both as a songwriter and singer, mixing romantic and fun lyrics.
In the 1980s, he was the musical assessor of the Televisión Española multidisciplinary contest "Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez", directed by Chicho Ibáñez Serrador.
He is acknowledged as creating a Spanish popular musical genre known as "La canción del verano". He has more than 700 songs to his name.
Back in 1990, Luis Aguilé created the music and lyrics of the anthem of CF Monterrey. It is considered one of the best soccer anthems in the world. He also made the anthem of Chivas Guadalajara.
He has also worked as a music producer and author, mainly on children's books and novels. He had been married to Ana Rodríguez Ruiz since 1976.
Aguilé died of stomach cancer in Madrid, Spain, on 10 October 2009.

Atlantic (Semitic) languages

The Atlantic languages of Semitic or "Semitidic" (para-Semitic) origin are a disputed concept in historical linguistics put forward by Theo Vennemann. He proposed that Semitic-language-speakers occupied regions in Europe thousands of years ago and influenced the later European languages that are not part of the Semitic family. The theory has found no notable acceptance among linguists or other relevant scholars and is criticised as being based on sparse and often-misinterpreted data.
Theory and lines of argumentation.
According to Vennemann, Afroasiatic seafarers settled the European Atlantic coast and are to be associated with the European Megalithic Culture. They left a superstratum in the Germanic languages and a substratum in the development of Insular Celtic. He claimed that speakers of "Atlantic" (Semitic or Semitidic) founded coastal colonies from the 5th millennium BC. Thus, "Atlantic" influenced the lexicon and the structure of Germanic and the structure of Insular Celtic. According to Vennemann, migrating Indo-European speakers encountered non-Indo-European speakers in Northern Europe, who had already named rivers, mountains, and settlements in a language that he called "Vasconic". He considered some toponyms on the Atlantic coast to be neither Vasconic nor Indo-European, but to have derived from languages that were related to the Mediterranean Hamito-Semitic group.
Vennemann based his theory on the claim that Germanic words without cognates in other Indo-European languages very often belong to semantic fields that are typical for loanwords from a superstratum language, such as warfare, law and communal life. Likewise, he proposed Semitic etymologies for words of unknown or disputed origin; for instance, he related the word "bee" to Egyptian "bj-t" or the name "Éire", older "*īwerijū" to "*ʼj-wrʼ(m)", 'island (of) copper', as in Akkadian "weriʼum" 'copper'.
Other evidence for a Semitic superstratum included a Semitic influence on the Germanic form of the Indo-European ablaut system and similarities between Germanic paganism and Mesopotamian mythology, such as the parallelism between Freyja and Ishtar, goddesses of war and love.
The idea of a connection between Insular Celtic and Afroasiatic goes back to John Davies (1632) but was expanded by John Morris-Jones in 1913 and was developed further by Vennemann. The position is supported by Julius Pokorny (1927–1949), and Vennemann identified Phoenicians as the likely people. A key factor was the dominant verb-initial word order in Insular Celtic, compared to other Indo-European languages, together with lexical correspondences. Another important factor was the identification of the people later known as Picts. Vennemann held the position that they spoke an Atlantic language. That belief was also held by Heinrich Zimmer (1898), but is not generally accepted today. (Pictish is broadly accepted as Insular Celtic, and most probably Brittonic.)
Criticism.
Hayim Y. Sheynin, adjunct professor of Jewish Literature at Gratz College, critically reviewed the work "Europa Vasconica – Europa Semitica" (2003) in which Vennemann laid out his arguments for the existence of a Semitic (or "Semitidic") superstratum in the Germanic languages. Sheynin concluded that Vennemann's arguments were unacceptable on several grounds. He noted that Vennemann based important parts of his main claim on long-outdated and critically rejected literature, that many of the words presented by Vennemann as evidence of an Atlantic (Semitidic) superstratum were nothing more than "mere ad hoc sound similarities" and that Vennemann's claims made in reference to Semitic range from "objectionable" to "ridiculous". In summary, Sheynin concludes "that [Vennemann] failed in this book not only as comparative linguist, or etymologist, but even in his narrow specialization as a Germanist... In short, we consider the book a complete failure".
The book was also reviewed by Baldi and Page ("Lingua" 116, 2006). They also were critical of his Germanic part of the theory. Since there are no Phoenician inscriptions in Britain, if traders visited the island, the Insular Celtic part of the theory depended on linguistic evidence. The 5th millennium is very early for Celtic-speakers in Britain, compared with other theories, and Mallory suggested a date of around 1000 BC. Vennemann's view of the establishment of megaliths is not supported by mainstream archaeologists, who view their construction as having a widespread local origin along Oceanic Europe or one that spread from Portugal long before the Bell Beaker or any possible Cardium culture influences from the Mediterranean. Eska (1994) argues that the change from verb-noninitial word order in Continental Celtic to verb-initial in Insular Celtic is internally motivated. Baldi and Page stated that the strength of Vennemann's proposals lies in his lexical arguments, which merited serious consideration. The origin of the Picts is unknown: see discussions by Jackson and by Wainright as well as those by Kitson and by Forsyth. Since about 2000, it has been generally held that Pictish is Indo-European (and clear evidence of Pre-Indo-European elements is absent).

Knudsen diffusion

Knudsen diffusion, named after Martin Knudsen, is a means of diffusion that occurs when the scale length of a system is comparable to or smaller than the mean free path of the particles involved. An example of this is in a long pore with a narrow diameter (2–50 nm) because molecules frequently collide with the pore wall. As another example, consider the diffusion of gas molecules through very small capillary pores. If the pore diameter is smaller than the mean free path of the diffusing gas molecules, and the density of the gas is low, the gas molecules collide with the pore walls more frequently than with each other, leading to Knudsen diffusion.
In fluid mechanics, the Knudsen number is a good measure of the relative importance of Knudsen diffusion. A Knudsen number much greater than one indicates Knudsen diffusion is important. In practice, Knudsen diffusion applies only to gases because the mean free path for molecules in the liquid state is very small, typically near the diameter of the molecule itself.
Mathematical description.
The diffusivity for Knudsen diffusion is obtained from the self-diffusion coefficient derived from the kinetic theory of gases:
For Knudsen diffusion, path length λ is replaced with pore diameter formula_2, as species "A" is now more likely to collide with the pore wall as opposed with another molecule. The Knudsen diffusivity for diffusing species "A", formula_3 is thus
where formula_5 is the gas constant (8.3144 J/(mol·K) in SI units), molar mass formula_6 is expressed in units of kg/mol, and temperature "T" (in kelvins). Knudsen diffusivity formula_3 thus depends on the pore diameter, species molar mass and temperature. Expressed as a molecular flux, Knudsen diffusion follows the equation for Fick's first law of diffusion:
Here, formula_9 is the molecular flux in mol/m²·s, formula_10 is the molar concentration in formula_11. The diffusive flux is driven by a concentration gradient, which in most cases is embodied as a pressure gradient ("i.e." formula_12 therefore formula_13 where formula_14 is the pressure difference between both sides of the pore and formula_15 is the length of the pore).
If we assume that formula_14 is much less than formula_17, the average absolute pressure in the system ("i.e." formula_18) then we can express the Knudsen flux as a volumetric flow rate as follows:
where formula_20 is the volumetric flow rate in formula_21. If the pore is relatively short, entrance effects can significantly reduce to net flux through the pore. In this case, the law of effusion can be used to calculate the excess resistance due to entrance effects rather easily by substituting an effective length formula_22 in for formula_15. Generally, the Knudsen process is significant only at low pressure and small pore diameter. However there may be instances where both Knudsen diffusion and molecular diffusion formula_24 are important. The effective diffusivity of species "A" in a binary mixture of "A" and "B", formula_25 is determined by
where formula_27 and formula_28 is the flux of component "i".
For cases where α = 0 (formula_29, i.e. countercurrent diffusion) or where formula_30 is close to zero, the equation reduces to
Knudsen self diffusion.
In the Knudsen diffusion regime, the molecules do not interact with one another, so that they move in straight lines between points on the pore channel surface. Self-diffusivity is a measure of the translational mobility of individual molecules. Under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium, a molecule is tagged and its trajectory followed over a long time. If the motion is diffusive, and in a medium without long-range correlations, the squared displacement of the molecule from its original position will eventually grow linearly with time (Einstein’s equation). To reduce statistical errors in simulations, the self-diffusivity, formula_32, of a species is defined from ensemble averaging Einstein’s equation over a large enough number of molecules "N".

4,5,6

4,5,6 is the debut solo studio album by American rapper Kool G Rap. It was released on September 26, 1995, via Cold Chillin' Records. The album's title signifies the winning combination at the urban street game of cee-lo.
The recording sessions took place at Bearsville Studios. The album was produced by Dr. Butcher, Buckwild, Naughty Shorts, and T-Ray. It features guest appearances from B-1, MF Grimm, Nas, and Shawn Brown.
The album peaked at number 24 on the "Billboard" 200 and atop the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. It was supported with singles "It's a Shame" and "Fast Life". The latter made it to number 74 on the "Billboard" Hot 100.
Background.
Following the critical acclaim of a three-album run with Thomas "DJ Polo" Pough, Kool G Rap chose to concentrate his efforts in a more underground direction, in continuation with the sound on his albums with DJ Polo. In early 1993, Kool G Rap separated from DJ Polo in the aftermath of the media controversy surrounding the cover art of their previous album "Live and Let Die". The cover – which depicted two police officers being hanged – followed the "Cop Killer" controversy involving Time Warner and Warner Bros. Records. Warner Bros. Records ultimately refused to distribute "Live and Let Die", resulting in the termination of its contract with Cold Chillin' Records. "Live and Let Die" was eventually released and distributed independently via Cold Chillin' in 1992. In 1995, Cold Chillin' signed a distribution deal with Epic Records, of which "4,5,6" was the first to be released under the new deal. It would also be Cold Chillin' Records' final release before it went defunct in 1997.
Composition.
Kool G Rap recorded the album in Bearsville, New York, giving it a dark, grimy street sound.
The title track, "4,5,6," depicts the urban street game of cee-lo and how it is played, along with rhymes of a braggadocio nature and his success and skill at cee-lo. The song starts with the notes from Weather Report's "Mysterious Traveller," which are used throughout the entire song and give the song a very dark street sound.
The single "It's a Shame" contains a prime example of mafioso rap themes and self-boasting. In the song, Kool G Rap portrays himself as a heroin kingpin from a first-person perspective, boasting of his wealth, power, and extravagant lifestyle. However, it is implied that he harbours a sense of remorse over his choice of trade, with Sean Brown on the chorus stating: "Now it's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar / Living in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holler".
The song "For Da Brothaz" details the falling of his friends and the unforgiving struggle on the streets of New York.
In the single "Fast Life," Kool G Rap and Nas Escobar (who also appeared on the front cover) rap about their business ventures and mafioso lifestyle. The video for the single revolves around the construction of the mythical "Fast Life Hotel and Casino."

Virginia State Route 43

State Route 43 (SR 43) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway consists of two disjoint segments that have a total length of . The southern portion of the state highway runs from U.S. Route 29 Business (US 29 Bus.) in Altavista north to the Blue Ridge Parkway at Peaks of Otter. The northern segment has a length of between the Blue Ridge Parkway near Buchanan and US 220 in Eagle Rock. The two sections of SR 43 are connected by of the Blue Ridge Parkway. The southern portion of the state highway connects Altavista with Bedford and Peaks of Otter. The northern section of SR 43 follows the James River through a narrow valley (Narrow Passage Road) between Buchanan and Eagle Rock.
SR 43 is a Virginia Byway except south of the US 29 bypass of Altavista.
Route description.
SR 43 has two disjoint sections. SR 43 begins at an intersection with US 29 Business (Main Street) in the town of Altavista. The terminus is just north of the Roanoke River, which forms the boundary between Campbell and Pittsylvania counties. The junction is also adjacent to the crossing of Norfolk Southern Railway's Altavista and Danville district rail lines. SR 43 heads northwest as Bedford Avenue to the town limit at the highway's diamond interchange with US 29 (Wards Road). The state highway continues north as Bedford Highway toward Lynch Station, where the highway curves to the southwest to parallel the north bank of the Roanoke River. At Leesville, a short distance north of the impoundment of the river to form Leesville Lake, SR 43 begins to follow Goose Creek and enters Bedford County. The state highway, now named Leesville Road, veers northwest and intersects SR 626 (Smith Mountain Lake Parkway) and SR 628 (Mentow Drive) in the hamlet of Mentow. SR 628 is also known as Bishop Creek Road, which provides a shorter, parallel route to SR 43 between Lynch Station and Mentow.
In the hamlet of Gillespie, SR 43 intersects SR 24 (Wyatts Way); the two highways head west concurrently as Glenwood Drive. West of Gillespie, SR 24 continues west as Shingle Block Road and SR 43 heads north along Virginia Byway toward Bedford, where the highway becomes South Street. Just after entering the town, the state highway crosses over US 460 and US 221 with no access. Just south of downtown, SR 43 splits into a pair of two-way street: northbound follows Talbott Street and Otey Street to Main Street while southbound follows South Street, which is one-way southbound for one block immediately south of Main Street. SR 43 turns west onto Main Street and has a very short concurrency with US 460 Bus. Two blocks to the west, SR 43 turns north onto Bridge Street, where the highway runs together with US 221 Bus. (signed as US 221) and SR 122 Bus. across Norfolk Southern's Blue Ridge District. North of the railroad bridge, SR 43 turns west onto Peak Street; US 221 Bus. and SR 122 Bus. heads northeast on Longwood Avenue.
SR 43 exits the town of Bedford on Peaks Road, which crosses the Otter River on its way to Blue Ridge Mountain. The state highway enters Jefferson National Forest and ascends the mountain among the Peaks of Otter. The southern section of SR 43 reaches its northern terminus at the Blue Ridge Parkway adjacent to the Peaks of Otter Visitor Center. The Blue Ridge Parkway heads northwest to Bearwallow Gap, where the northern section of SR 43 begins at an interchange. The state highway, which is named Parkway Drive, enters Botetourt County and descends Cove Mountain to the town of Buchanan. SR 43 turns onto Main Street and has a short concurrency with US 11 to cross the James River. On the north side of the river, the state highway turns west onto First Street and leaves the town as Narrow Passage Road, which re-enters the national forest. SR 43 passes under Interstate 81 with no access and parallels the river past James River High School and the community of Springwood. Narrow Passage Road then continues on to the town of Eagle Rock, where the highway is known as Second Street and passes through a water gap between Rathole Mountain and Crawford Mountain. The state highway follows the river north a short distance to its northern terminus at US 220 (Botetourt Road).

Scrum V

Scrum V (pronounced "Scrum Five") is the brand used by BBC Cymru Wales for its rugby union programming. The brand extends to BBC Wales' live coverage, Scrum V Live, highlights and discussion programmes, radio discussion and website.
Television.
Prior to the introduction of "Scrum V", BBC Wales broadcast a discussion-based rugby union programme called "Rugby Special Wales" which had been on the air since 1986. In September 1995, this was replaced by "Scrum V". In addition, live rugby matches in Wales that are not shown across the UK are shown under the title "Scrum V Live". This primarily consists of games in the Pro12/Pro14 league to which the BBC held rights to. The "Scrum V" Red Zone available via the red button on satellite TV was hosted by Rick O'Shea. However, after the BBC lost the rights to the league, the programme was scaled back – the only games currently shown are in the Welsh Premiership alongside S4C.
The show was initially presented by Alan Wilkins and Eddie Butler. Graham Thomas joined the presentation team in 1998. In 2006, following disputes between the Welsh Rugby Union and the BBC, both Thomas and Butler left the show. Gareth Lewis took over presentation of both the live match coverage and discussion show. In 2011, Ross Harries took over as presenter when Lewis took up a new role with BBC Radio Wales.
Alternative commentary for live matches is also broadcast via the Red Button, and is available outside Wales on Freeview even though the ordinary programme is not available on Freeview outside Wales.
Website.
The "Scrum V" website contains information about the programme, further features centred on Welsh rugby as well as the ability to watch previous editions of the show. The "Scrum V" website also houses the BBC Rugby Union messageboards. Like the television programme, the website uses a different visual style to that of the rest of BBC Sport, although quotes from the "Scrum V" messageboard are incorporated into the main BBC Sport website. The original website was produced and run by Welsh historian and author Sean Davies and later continued by Welsh writer Dave Lewis.
Radio.
For the 2006/07 season it was announced that a Thursday night discussion programme would be broadcast on BBC Radio Wales under the "Scrum V" branding.

<doc id="7032858" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7032858" title="Trigoniidae">
Trigoniidae

Trigoniidae is a taxonomic family of saltwater clams, marine bivalve mollusks in the superfamily Trigonioidea. There is only one living genus, "Neotrigonia", but in the geological past this family was well represented, widespread and common. The shells of species in this family are morphologically unusual, with very elaborate hinge teeth, and the exterior of the shell is highly ornamented.
Description.
The most striking feature of the Trigoniidae, which has attracted attention for centuries, is their external ornamentation. This is usually present as ribs or costae, or rows of aligned tubercles. The hinge teeth of the shell are unusually elaborate in structure. The living animal has no siphon.
Origin.
This family originated from the Myophoriidae in the Triassic. The family underwent an explosion of diversity in the Jurassic, reaching a maximum of diversity in the Cretaceous, although most genera became extinct at the end of this period. Although they were abundant in the Mesozoic era, they are today represented by only one living genus, "Neotrigonia", which inhabits waters off the coast of southern Australia.
Discovery of a living genus.
Before the beginning of the 19th century, no trigoniid had been described that was more recent than the Cretaceous Period. In 1802, however, François Péron discovered a living species in waters off the coast of Tasmania. Lamarck named it "Trigonia margaritacea" in 1804, with Cossmann renaming the genus "Neotrigonia" in 1912. Today, five living species have been identified, and are all found off the coast of Australia. "Neotrigonia" probably evolved from "Eotrigonia" (Eocene to Miocene) during the Miocene.
The gills of "Neotrigonia" and fossil trigoniids are mineralized with calcium phosphate, which supports their chitinous scaffold support structures.
Previous research.
Because of their large size and pronounced ornament, fossil trigoniid bivalves have long attracted interest. Jean Guillaume Bruguiere was the first person to describe an example of "Trigonia" in 1789. Lamarck later figured specimens from the Oxfordian of France. In England the physician James Parkinson (the discoverer of Parkinson's disease) described examples of "Trigonia" and "Myophorella". Later, James Sowerby and James De Carle Sowerby began to catalogue British examples in earnest. Etheldred Benett added several Upper Jurassic species, although her work was not primarily recognised due to the academic status of women at that time.
In 1840 Europe, Louis Agassiz published a large volume entitled "Memoire sur les Trigonies" which recognised the large variation encountered within the family, dividing it into eight sections, which was a precursor to the generic classification that occurred some fifty years later. Other notable workers that described and figured trigoniids include Friedrich August von Quenstedt, Alcide d'Orbigny and Georg August Goldfuss.
The major worker on the Trigoniidae in the nineteenth century was John Lycett, a physician from Gloucestershire who published a text entitled "A Monograph of British Fossil Trigoniae".
Later research - the twentieth century.
Work on the Trigoniidae has generally been sparse in the 20th century and has mainly concentrated upon the development towards a workable taxonomy. Today, knowledge is sufficient to divide the family into five Subfamilies (see below), which together contain more than sixteen genera, the most abundant being "Trigonia", "Myophorella", "Laevitrigonia", and "Orthotrigonia".
Family characteristics.
The trigoniid hinge.
Members of the Trigoniidae are identified by the large and complex dentition that joins the two valves together and allows articulation. The teeth and supporting area can take up almost a third of the volume of the shell. The hinge structure is amongst the most complex of all bivalves, namely that the teeth are numerous and ridge-like with strong transverse striations. It is these striations which distinguishes the Trigoniidae from the more primitive Myophoriidae. The Trigoniidae almost certainly evolved by a monophyletic modification of a Triassic myophoriid, with three genera appearing in the Middle Triassic.
Commonly found genera.
Trigoniids are commonly found in both limestone, mudstone and sandstone in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks all over the world. In Britain, examples are numerous in the Upper Jurassic rocks of the Dorset coast, particularly around the village of Osmington Mills. Other Jurassic rocks that yield specimens include the Cornbrash in Yorkshire and the Middle Jurassic sequence in the Cotswolds, particularly around Cleeve Hill, near Cheltenham. "Pterotrigonia (Scabrotrigonia) thoracica" has been named state fossil of Tennessee.
"Trigonia".
The genus "Trigonia" is the most readily identifiable member of the family, having a series of strong ribs or costae along the anterior part of the shell exterior. They are the first representatives of the family to appear in the Middle Triassic (Anisian) of Chile and New Zealand. The first European examples ("Trigonia costata" Parkinson) turn up in the Lower Jurassic (Toarcian) of Sherborne, Dorset and Gundershofen, Switzerland.

Cerball mac Dúnlainge

Cerball mac Dúnlainge (patronymic sometimes spelled Dúngaile, ) (died 888) was king of Ossory in south-east Ireland. The kingdom of Ossory ("Osraige") occupied roughly the area of modern County Kilkenny and western County Laois and lay between the larger provincial kingdoms of Munster and Leinster.
Cerball came to prominence after the death of Fedelmid mac Crimthainn, King of Munster, in 847. Ossory had been subject for a period to the Eóganachta kings of Munster, but Feidlimid was succeeded by a series of weak kings who had to contend with Viking incursions on the coasts of Munster. As a result, Cerball was in a strong position and is said to have been the second most powerful king in Ireland in his later years. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his brother Riagan mac Dúnlainge.
Kjarvalr Írakonungr (Old Norse: ; Modern Icelandic: ), a figure in the Norse sagas who appears as an ancestor of many prominent Icelandic families, is identified with Cerball.
Nature of the sources.
A large body of contemporary and near-contemporary material on early medieval Ireland has survived. From the titles of works mentioned in these sources, it is clear that a great deal of additional material has now been lost. The surviving materials usually exist in the form of much later copies, and it is only from comparison of the various texts that the original documents can be reconstructed.
The Irish annals which document the ninth century are ultimately derived from the now-lost Chronicle of Ireland which was then being compiled in the midlands of Ireland. All annals include material derived from other sources, or added at a later date. None are complete, although the "Annals of Ulster" and the "Annals of Inisfallen" cover Cerball's lifetime. The "Annals of Clonmacnoise" survive only in an eccentric 17th-century English translation, and the "Annals of Tigernach" for this period are lost, although Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh's abbreviated copy known as the "Chronicon Scotorum" supplies much of the missing material. The "Annals of the Four Masters" are late, and include some material of doubtful origin. While the annals provide a considerable amount of information, they are generally terse, and most focus their attention on the doings of the Uí Néill, sometimes to the extent of omitting inconvenient events.
A source which concentrates on Cerball's career is the "Fragmentary Annals of Ireland", so called because only fragments remain of a seemingly longer work, these again copied by Mac Fhirbhisigh in the 17th century from a 15th-century manuscript. The fragment which deals with Cerball's lifetime ends in the early 870s, so that the last fifteen years of his life are missing. Joan Radner, editor and translator of the modern edition of the "Fragmentary Annals", argues that these were compiled at the court of Cerball's great-great-grandson Donnchad mac Gilla Pátraic. Although called annals, these are closer to narrative history and are derived from a number of sources. The basic framework is from the "Chronicle of Ireland", but to this has been added a variety of material whose source is unknown, perhaps including early sagas, which concerns Cerball. The "Fragmentary Annals" were intended to magnify Cerball's achievements, and to present his dealings with Vikings and Norse–Gaels in a favourable light.
If the various annals are partisan, the remaining sources which concern Cerball are notably unreliable. Perhaps inspired by the Fragmentary Annals, which offer some positive views of Vikings and may have been popular in the Norse-Gael Dublin of the 11th century, many Icelandic genealogies include Cerball—Kjarvalr Írakonungr—as an ancestor. Lastly, "The Prophecy of Berchán", an 11th-century verse history of kings in Ireland and Scotland presented as a prophecy, may include Cerball.
A very large number of genealogies exist, along with geographical and legal texts. Of these last, the "Frithfolad Muman", a document purporting to set out the obligations of the Kings of Munster to their allies, clients, and subjects is of interest as it sheds light on the position of Osraige within the provincial kingship of Munster.
Cerball's Ireland.
A memory of the kingdom of Osraige survives today in the name and boundaries of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ossory. The earliest recorded seat of the bishops was at Saighir, later moved to Aghaboe, and this appears to have been the principal church of the kingdom by the eighth century when the life of Saint Cainnech of Aghaboe was composed. The name Osraige—the Deer people—is among the oldest group of Irish tribal names. Although genealogists in the Early Christian period explained such names by recourse to eponymous ancestors, the names are likely those of totemic animals or tribal deities.
Osraige was only one "túath" among 150 in Ireland. The average "túath" was small, perhaps 500 square kilometres in area with a population of some three to four thousand. Osraige was atypical, much larger than this, covering perhaps 2000 square kilometres astride the River Barrow in the modern counties of Kilkenny, Laois, and Offaly. In principle, each "tuath" had its own king and court and bishop, but political power generally rested with the provincial over-kings.
At the time of Cerball's birth Osraige lay within the province and kingdom of Munster, ruled by the Eóganachta from the royal centre of Cashel. Osraige lay at the extreme eastern edge of Munster bordering the neighbouring province of Leinster. For a period in the seventh century, most of southern Osraige was ruled by the Corcu Loígde, rulers of Munster before the coming of the Eóganachta. The "Frithfolad Muman" text states that the Osraige had once been kings of Munster and makes it clear that they were a privileged and powerful group, but no longer a major force, "the respectable has-beens of Munster politics".
The period of Cerball's life covered much of the first Viking Age, and he is notably mentioned in later Nordic sources. The Icelandic Landnámabók describes Cearbhall ("Kjarvalur") as ruler of Dublin and Earl of Orkney and opens with a list of the most prominent rulers in Viking-age Europe, listing this Ossorian king alongside other well-known rulers of that era, specifically Popes Adrian II and John VIII; Byzantine Emperors Leo VI the Wise and his brother Alexander; Harald Fairhair, king of Norway; Eric Anundsson and his son Björn Eriksson rulers of Sweden; Gorm the Old, king of Denmark; and Alfred the Great, king of England. While several kingdoms in Britain – East Anglia, Fortriu, Mercia, and Northumbria – would collapse under the shock of Viking attacks, their impact in Ireland was very much less immediate. In the first half of the ninth century, raiders appear to have come in small groups, increasing in size until larger forces appear, such as that led by the shadowy Turgéis (Turgesius) in the 840s, and those led by Amlaíb and Ímar from the 850s onwards. Vikings would be both enemies and allies for Cerball and other Irish kings. In the long run, the creation of Norse–Gaelic towns by Vikings operating as traders rather than raiders would change the Irish political landscape, but the results of this were seen in the tenth and eleventh centuries rather than the ninth.
Máel Sechnaill and the Danes.
Cerball succeeded his father Dúnlang (or Dúngal) mac Fergaile as king of Osraige in 842. At this time the High King of Ireland was Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid who was married to Cerball's sister Land. Cerball in turn was married to a daughter of Máel Sechnaill.
The first report of Cerball is in 846, when Vikings attacked into northern Osraige, destroying a church at Coolcashin (near Galmoy), and plundering an unidentified settlement at "Cúl Maine". Here the raiders were besieged for a fortnight by Cerball's army and lost heavily. The following year Cerball defeated an attack by Vikings from the Irish midlands, perhaps from Dublin, led by one Hákon. This battle is said by some sources to have taken place at "Carn Brammit", a site which can no longer be identified.
The late "Annals of the Four Masters" record an invasion of Osraige in 848 by the Uí Ceinnselaig of southern Leinster, led by their king Echtigern mac Guaire. Cerball played a part in Echtgern's removal in 853. The "Annals of Ulster" report that Echtigern was killed "deceitfully" by Cerball and one Bruatur of Áed, and that Bruatur was killed by his own household a week later.
In 854, the "Fragmentary Annals" say that Cerball was sent into Munster by his brother-in-law to collect tribute and hostages.
In 855, he is said to have slaughtered a Viking force under a certain Rodolb. In the aftermath of the battle Cerball was captured by other Vikings, but succeeded in escaping. Shortly afterwards Cerball aided a force of Danes led by a chief named Horm in their war with the Norwegians. The Danes may well have settled at what is now Waterford. The Munstermen asked Cerball's help against the Norse, and Cerball with the men of Osraige, Horm's Danes and some of the men of Munster inflicted a heavy defeat on the Norse. His ally Horm was killed raiding in Wales by Rhodri the Great.
Amlaíb and Ímar.
Cerball next appears to have allied himself with two Norse or Norse-Gael "kings", Amlaíb Conung, "son of the king of Lochlann", and Ímar, called "king of the Norsemen of all Ireland and Britain" at his death in 873. Ímar is sometimes assumed to be the same person as Ivar the Boneless and Amlaíb to be Olaf the White, respectively son of the legendary Danish Viking Ragnar Lodbrok and Olaf Geirstad-Alf of Vestfold descendant of the Yngling dynasty of Norway. These allies were not sufficiently strong to prevent Máel Sechnaill from taking hostages and tribute from Cerball in 858, but Cerball and Ímar campaigned in Leinster that year, and also against the Norse-Gaels in Munster. The following year, together with Amlaíb Conung, they raided Máel Sechnaill's lands in Mide, but soon afterwards Cerball was compelled to submit again to Máel Sechnaill.
In 860 Cerball defeated a force of Norse who were raiding in Osraige, and later in the year he joined Máel Sechnaill on campaign against Áed Finnliath in the north of Ireland.
Áed and Flann.
Máel Sechnaill died in 862 to be succeeded by Áed Finnliath, who married his widow, Cerball's sister Land. Also in 862, Cerball is reported to have defeated a Norwegian fleet under one Rodolb, although it is not clear that this is the same Rodolb who was defeated in 855. In 864 the "Fragmentary Annals of Ireland" report that the men of Leinster and their Norse allies raided Osraige in revenge for Cerball's raid, and that Eóganachta of Munster took advantage of this to attack him, so that Cerball raided both his neighbours and caused much destruction. The same year he is said to have attacked the neighbouring Déisi.
In 870 Áed Finnliath brought a large army to Leinster and Cerball accompanied him. The army of the y was camped apart from Áed's main force, and was attacked by the Leinstermen. Although Cerball drove them off with heavy loss, Cennétig son of Gáethíne, a kinsman of Cerball, was killed in the battle. With a final notice of an expedition to Connacht and Munster in 871, the "Fragmentary Annals" are interrupted. In the "Annals of Ulster", nothing more is said of Cerball until his death in 888. The next king of Osraige was his brother Riacán.
Legacy.
Cerball is remembered in historical sources as a great and heroic king, possessed of victorious and daring exploits with many colourful anecdotes written about him. He is mentioned in all the major Irish annals, bringing the Osraige into military prominence during his reign, securing a very strong marriage alliance with the high king and gaining political independence away from Munster. Irish, Scandinavian and Welsh sources record his existence; several annals in particular contain unique information about him.
The Fragmentary Annals.
Of all the Irish annals, the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland contain the most information about him, being composed in Osraige likely at the commission of his descendant Donnchad mac Gilla Pátraic, and therefore caution must be exercised over it as a source. Cerball is portrayed as an archetype of a Christian king who consistently vanquishes his enemies, especially pagan Vikings; yet is recorded allying with rival bands of Vikings to defeat them during his early career. Those Vikings allied with Cerball are portrayed in a more favorable light than those he defeats, thus mitigating the stigma of a Christian king allying with pagan marauders.
Landnámabók.
The Icelandic Landnámabók describes Cerball ("Kjarvalur") as ruler of Dublin and Earl of Orkney and opens with a list of the most prominent rulers in Viking-age Europe, listing this Ossorian king alongside Popes Adrian II and John VIII; Byzantine Emperors Leo VI the Wise and his brother Alexander; Harald Fairhair, king of Norway; Eric Anundsson and his son Björn Eriksson rulers of Sweden; Gorm the Old king of Denmark; and Alfred the Great, king of England.
While it is unsurprising that Cerball's great-great-grandson should have commissioned a work in which his most illustrious ancestor was portrayed in a heroic light, it is less obvious why Cerball in particular should have such a prominent place in the Icelandic sagas and in the genealogies of the founding families of Iceland as recorded by the "Landnámabók". The "Landnámabók" mentions "Kormlöð", "Rafarta, the daughter of Kjarval", "Dufnial, who was the son of Kjarval" and "Friðgerðr, the daughter of Kjarval". Rafarta or Raforta is also mentioned in "Njál's saga, Gretti's saga" and the "Laxdæla saga", and Friðgerðr in the Vinland sagas. The marriage of "Eithne, daughter of King Kjarval of Ireland" and Hlodvir Thorfinnsson, Earl of Orkney is reported in the "Orkneyinga saga" and Earl Sigurd the Stout, who was killed at the battle of Clontarf is called their son.
Some of these names are Irish: Kormlöð is the common name Gormflaith, Eithne too is clearly Irish as is Dufnial. It is doubtful whether Rafarta or Fridgerd are Irish, and there are clearly difficulties with the supposed number of generations. Insofar as any conclusions have been reached by historians of Ireland, it appears that the supposed descendants of Cerball left for Iceland in the generation before Donnchad mac Gilla Patraic, towards the end of the tenth century. Given the likely date at which the "Landnámabók" was compiled, this is rather too far in the past for the genealogies to be considered very reliable. Adding to the uncertainty, the genealogies of the Osraige themselves were subject to comprehensive rewriting in Cerball's time and immediately afterwards, attaching them to the Laigin of Leinster.
It has been suggested that the importance of Cerball in Icelandic writings stems from the popularity of the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland among the Norse-Gaels of eleventh century Ireland, who passed these accounts on to the Icelanders, who then attached this famous and warlike king to their ancestry. Whether Cerball was in fact an ancestor of many prominent settler families is, however, of rather less importance than the fact that the Icelanders considered it worth reporting their descent from Cerball mac Dúnlainge, whether real or contrived. As with the adoption of Norse names, sagas and other features, and the creation of the Norse-Gael culture, Cerball's adoption in Iceland is an example of the contacts between Norse and Gaelic society in the Viking Age.
Annales Cambriae.
Cerball's repose is noted in the for the year 887, which is noteworthy as he is the only Irish king mentioned therein who wasn't an Uí Néill high king. This indicates his contemporary importance.
Other textual sources.
Cerball appears to be referenced in The Prophecy of Berchán, although not by name.
Modern day.
Cerball is noted by historians to have been a patron of noteworthy building projects in his kingdom, and his reign likely birthed a flourishing of artistically fine stone carving in Osraige. In late February 2017, Kilkenny's new Medieval Mile Museum opened to the public, featuring an exhibit which highlights king Cerball's role as a powerful patron of Osraige's early high cross carving tradition.
Family tree.
Cerball is hailed as an illustrious ancestor of several prominent lineages in both Ireland, Scotland and Iceland. He is the direct male ancestor of the kings of Osraige after him, and as such is the direct male-line progenitor of the Mac Giolla Phádraig clan who maintained kingship over Osraige and succeeded in the Barony of Upper Ossory in addition to the Earldom of the same and the Castletown Barons. He is also direct-male ancestor of the prominent clan Ua Braonáin (O'Brennan) of Uí Duach (Idough) in Osraige who were a junior sept stemming from a younger son of Cerball. Icelandic literature also names him as the maternal grandfather of Helgi the Lean, a prominent settler of Iceland from whom many Icelandic families claim descent, including the saga-hero Gunnar of Hlíðarendi.

Bootsplash

A bootsplash, also known as a bootscreen, is a graphical representation of the boot process of the operating system.
A bootsplash can be a simple visualization of the scrolling boot messages in the console, but it can also present graphics or some combinations of both.
Unlike splash screens, a bootsplash is not necessarily designed for marketing purposes; it can be intended to enhance the experience of the user as eye candy, or provide the user with messages (with an added advantage of color-coding facility) to diagnose the state of the system.
Microsoft Windows.
All versions of Microsoft Windows feature a boot screen, which is loaded during the startup process. With extra, third-party utilities, it is possible to replace the default Windows boot screen with custom images, text, and/or animations.
Windows Vista.
In Windows Vista, the default boot screen is represented by a green indeterminate progress indicator. The boot screen can be changed so that it displays a static image of an aurora with the text, "Starting Windows Vista" by enabling the "No GUI boot" option within the Windows System Configuration Utility (msconfig.exe). Microsoft would update the aurora image throughout the lifecycle of the operating system, starting with the first service pack, where it was altered to match the image displayed during the operating system's hibernation screen.
Windows 7.
In Windows 7, the boot screen will initially display the "Starting Windows" text, then a Windows flag animation will appear at the center of the screen. On unsupported systems, and sometimes when booting into recovery environment, the Windows Vista boot screen will be used instead as the fallback.
Changes of the boot screen, although possible through third-party utilities, is extremely risky and may cause the system to be unable to boot. Also, the hidden "Aurora" boot screen was removed.
Windows 8 and later.
 In Windows 8 and later, the boot screen will display the Windows logo along with the loading circle. On Legacy boot, the boot screen is displayed in 1024×768 resolution, and the boot screen is squished to accommodate for the 16:9 aspect ratio. On UEFI boot, the boot screen is displayed in highest resolution available. If the ACPI BGRT table is present, the boot screen will display the OEM logo instead.

Virginia State Route 45

State Route 45 (SR 45) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs from the junction of U.S. Route 15 Business (US 15 Business) and US 460 Business in Farmville north to SR 6 at Georges Tavern. SR 45 is the primary north–south highway of Cumberland County, where the highway meets US 60 near the county seat, Cumberland.
Route description.
SR 45 begins at an intersection with US 15 Business and US 460 Business near the campus of Longwood University in the town of Farmville, which has portions in Prince Edward and Cumberland counties. US 15 Business heads south on Main Street and US 460 Business heads east on Third Street; the two business routes head west together on Third Street. SR 45 heads north on Main Street and intersects the High Bridge Trail, a rail trail along a former Norfolk Southern Railway line. The state highway leaves the downtown area and crosses the Appomattox River into Cumberland County. SR 45 heads northeast from the town as Cumberland Road, which passes through the small communities of Raines Tavern, Hawk, Guinea Mills, and McRae on its way to a junction with US 60 (James Anderson Highway).
SR 45 and US 60 run concurrently northeast past the county seat of Cumberland. The two highways meet the western end of SR 13 before they separate. SR 45 heads northeast as Cartersville Road through the hamlets of Ashby and Whiteville on its way to Hamilton. In Hamilton, the state highway veers east, then turns north next to the historic home Morven to head into Cartersville. SR 45 bypasses the Cartersville Historic District to the east as it descends to the James River. The state highway crosses the river immediately upstream of the ruins of the historic Cartersville Bridge. SR 45 continues through Goochland County to its northern terminus at SR 6 (River Road) at Georges Tavern.

Dorotheus of Athens

Dorotheus (, secular name Ioannis Kottaras ) was Archbishop of Athens and All Greece from 1956 to 1957. He was born in Hydra in 1888 and studied theology at the University of Athens, from where he graduated in 1909. He then studied law at the Universities of Athens and Leipzig, and specialised in ecclesiastical law. For a brief period, he was a schoolteacher in Sparta.
He became a monk, and was ordained a deacon on 18 September 1910 by Ioasaph, the Metropolitan Bishop of Hydra and Spetses, and served as a deacon for nine years in the Church of St George Carytses in Athens. On 18 December 1922 he was ordained a priest by Procopius, the Metropolitan Bishop of Hydra and Spetses. Two days later, he was ordained a bishop by the Metropolitan Bishops of Fthiotida, Ambrosius and Syros Athanasius, and was appointed Metropolitan Bishop of Kythera and Antikythera.
On 15 January 1935 he was transferred to the Metropolis of Larissa and Platamon from where he was appointed Archbishop of Athens and All Greece on 29 March 1956, succeeding Archbishop Spyridon.
Dorotheus went to London to meet with Giorgos Seferis, the poet-diplomat then serving as Greek ambassador to the United Kingdom, on 13 June 1957. After the meeting, Dorotheus commented that he felt unwell. He was admitted to a hospital on 22 June, at which point he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He died in a Stockholm clinic on 26 July 1957; his death was announced in Athens by telegram. Konstantinos Karamanlis, then Prime Minister of Greece, responded to the new of Dorotheus's death by saying "The Church has prematurely lost a wise, humble and hardworking hierarch, one whom it sorely needed in these difficult times for the nation." During his life, he wrote over forty treatises on ecclesiastical law.

Nora Buchanan

Nora Buchanan is a fictional character from the American soap opera "One Life to Live". The role was originated by Hillary B. Smith in September 1992, and she remained on the show through the original television finale on January 13, 2012. Smith reprised the role when new regular episodes of "OLTL" began airing on Hulu, iTunes, and FX Canada via The Online Network in April 2013. "General Hospital" executive producer Frank Valentini announced in January 2017 that Smith would crossover the role of Nora to "General Hospital". Smith first appeared on March 6, 2017, and reappeared in November of the same year. In 2019, Smith once again reprised her role as Nora on "General Hospital" from April 1 to April 16 of that year.
Casting.
Nora is portrayed by actress Hillary B. Smith. Nora was introduced as a guest character in 1992, by head writer Michael Malone and executive producer Linda Gottlieb. Prior to her casting in "One Life to Live", Smith was already an established actress in the genre of daytime drama. She had previously starred as Kit McCormick on "The Doctors" in 1982, and one year later, took over the role of Margo Hughes on "As the World Turns", a role she played from 1983 to 1989. When she won the role of Nora on the show, producers were impressed with her hard-nosed approach to the character but wanted Smith to become a redhead and show Nora's soft side. Her first front-burner storyline was a six-week trial in which she defended Todd Manning and his fraternity brothers, who were accused of gang-raping college student Marty Saybrooke. The actress said in an interview with "Soap Opera Digest", "When [then-Executive Producer] Linda Gottlieb told me [Nora] would be representing the rapists and would get them off, I was nauseated. To let the rapists get off — I thought that was a really bad message." Smith later persuaded the writers to change the outcome and a mistrial was declared.
Almost immediately after her debut, Nora became a centerpiece of the show, particularly for her involvement in the multiple-Emmy Award winning rape trial storyline. Smith considered leaving the drama on several occasions. In 2000, Felicity LaFortune pinch-hit for Smith while she was on leave. When her contract was set to expire in 2005, Smith's character was put into a six-month coma. However, she signed another four-year contract that following December. Smith inked a new contract again in 2010, making her a mainstay on the soap for twenty years.
In January 2017, it was revealed that Smith would reprise her role as Nora on "General Hospital", making her the first "One Life to Live" actress to cross over to another soap since the end of Prospect Park's lawsuit against ABC. She first appeared on March 6, 2017. On November 10, 2017, it was announced that Smith would return to "General Hospital" from November 13 to 21, 2017. Smith once again returned to "General Hospital" from April 1 to April 16, 2019.
Storylines.
"One Life to Live".
When Nora debuted in 1992, she quickly made a connection with fans for her backstory as the Jewish attorney and ex-wife of previously established African American Llanview District Attorney, Hank Gannon, and mother to Rachel. She has an older sister, Susannah Hanen, a psychiatrist. Nora's popularity continued to grow as she played a key role in some of the show's most popular storylines on the 1990s, most notably the Marty Saybrooke gang rape trial in 1993. The character is also known for her supercouple romance with Bo Buchanan, culminating in their popular 1995 rock 'n' roll-themed wedding.
Nora meets Bo in October 1992; that Thanksgiving, he and his wife Sarah are involved in a hit and run accident and Sarah is killed. Over the next several months, Nora and Bo work side by side trying to track down the killer. The case is finally closed and the two become best friends; slowly their relationship grows into romance after a kiss on New Year's Eve. Bo and Nora first have sex in April 1993. However, Nora's chronic headaches worsen, leading her to believe that she had caused the accident that led to Sarah's death. Bo soon proves this to be false and proposes marriage. During Nora's recovery from a brain tumor, she is terrorized by former client Todd Manning, whom she had betrayed while defending him for Marty's rape, leading to his conviction. Bo and Nora marry on June 1, 1995.
Bo is devastated when his son Drew is killed. Nora hopes to conceive a child to give Bo a reason to live; out of desperation, she turns to former lover, Sam Rappaport. The pregnancy pulls Bo back onto his feet, but he and Nora later divorce when Sam's jealous ex-wife, Lindsay, publicly reveals that Nora's son had been fathered by Sam. Sam dies in 2003, leaving behind a letter which reveals that Bo is the biological father of Nora’s son, Matthew.
In 2004, Nora begins to date District Attorney Daniel Colson, and he eventually proposes. After their wedding, Nora begins to suspect that Daniel is having an affair. When Daniel is set to be sworn in as Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, he is arrested for the murders of Paul Cramer and Jennifer Rappaport. Nora learns of Daniel's homosexual affair with Mark Solomon, and Daniel is soon sent to prison.
Nora suffers a stroke and becomes comatose for months. After waking from her coma, Nora begins to put her life back on track. Nora's house catches fire, and she realizes that she was another victim of racist arsonist, Tate Harmon. Her former father-in-law, Asa Buchanan, invites Nora and Matthew to move in indefinitely. After Asa's death, he leaves the mansion to Nora in his will. During their time in Texas for the will reading, Nora and Clint Buchanan begin a romantic relationship.
Nora and Bo's teenage son, Matthew, is in a car accident with Marty's teenaged son, Cole Thornhart, who has become a drug addict. He survives, but is paralyzed from the waist down. Nora, who had taken in Cole after the supposed death of his mother, is furious and initially wants to send Cole to prison. However, remembering Rachel's own drug addiction, she changes her mind and allows Cole to go into rehab instead.
Dealing with Matthew's paralysis brings Bo and Nora closer, sparking Clint's jealousy. Clint calls neurosurgeon Dr. Greg Evans, who is confident that he can restore the use of Matthew's legs, but when he cannot guarantee that Matthew will survive the operation, Nora and Bo refuse to allow Greg to operate. Furious, Matthew hires Téa Delgado to sue his parents for the right to make the choice for himself. The matter is complicated when, on the night before Nora's wedding to Clint, Matthew catches his parents passionately kissing. He attempts to blackmail them into giving consent for the surgery; they call his bluff and ultimately Matthew cannot intentionally hurt Clint by telling him what he saw.
Bo's growing feelings for Nora seem to be reciprocated, but a confused Nora simply will not allow herself to hurt Clint by pursuing them. Shortly after her wedding to Clint, Matthew sues Bo and Nora for the right to have the operation. Bo and Nora grow closer as they unite to stop Matthew. When they take him to London, they finally confess their true feelings for each other and passionately kiss. Clint later finds out about Nora's feelings for Bo and confronts her; she admits that she's fallen back in love with Bo, and Clint quickly divorces her.
Shortly after Bo and Nora's reunion, he is shot but survives. Bo and Nora remarry in June 2010. Several months into their marriage, Nora becomes jealous of Bo's new secretary, Inez Salinger. Inez begins dating Clint, who blackmails her into seducing Bo as revenge against Bo and Nora for humiliating him with their reunion. Clint also pays Inez's ex-husband, Eddie Ford, to kidnap Nora and hold her hostage while Inez drugs Bo in an attempt to make him think they'd slept together. Though Eddie tries to rape Nora, she is eventually rescued, and Eddie is shot and killed shortly thereafter. Nora leaves Bo when she learns of his "affair" with Inez, but once Inez confesses to drugging Bo, Nora takes him back.
Bo and Nora focus on finding Eddie Ford's killer and are stunned when Clint informs them that it was Matthew. After much soul-searching, Bo and Nora decide to keep Matthew’s role in the murder a secret. Bo and Nora welcome their grandson, Drew Buchanan II, to their family on the series finale, which aired on January 13, 2012.
To Nora and Bo's dismay, Matthew is not an involved father to his son. Regardless, Nora and Bo gladly accept the role of grandparents and offer support Drew. Nora also finds time to return to her college passion of doling out advice as a disc jockey. With Bo's encouragement, she begins hosting a radio call-in program as the “Nightbird.”
"General Hospital".
Nora arrives in Port Charles, New York in March 2017, first appearing in an encounter Diane Miller. Nora is the hired private lawyer for Valentin Cassadine in a child custody lawsuit for his daughter, Charlotte, against her biological mother Lulu Spencer Falconeri.

Take the Leap!

Take the Leap! is the fifth solo studio album by the British singer Toyah Willcox, first released as Leap! in 1993 by Pony Canyon. It consists of new tracks as well as re-recordings of older songs from Toyah the band's repertoire.
Background.
The album was recorded in 1993 in a deserted farmhouse in the outskirts of Salisbury, in collaboration with the British band Friday Forever whom Toyah had met earlier that year. It showed a change in style from Toyah's previous recordings, and has a much more "raw" feel than the polished albums which preceded it. Many of the six new compositions had been written and demoed much earlier, including "Invisible Love" in 1989 with Simon Darlow. A glutch of demos recorded with Phil Nicholas in 1992 were also re-worked from their ambient style into album tracks with a rockier feel, namely "God Ceases to Dream" and "Now I'm Running". Another demo from these sessions, "Tears for Elie" was included as a bonus track on the 2006 reissue CD, along with "Requite Me", a stray 1992 demo produced by Willcox and Darlow.
"God Ceases to Dream" was written and recorded as an ambient electronic demo. It contains lyrics and melodies Willcox had originally written and performed with collaborative band side-projects, as the songs "Born Again" with Sunday All Over the World, and "Broken Special (The Island)" with Kiss of Reality. The latter was recorded and appeared on the Kiss of Reality's sophomore studio album, whilst "Born Again" was never recorded in studio. The chanting at the beginning of this album's version of "Ieya" are lyrics (which crib the Lord's Prayer) which also appeared on the Kiss of Reality album opening track "Harlequin (Holy Day)".
"Lust for Love" had previously been written and performed live as a song, and later recorded as a demo by Cris Bonacci and Willcox. The version found on this album is subtly altered.
"It's a Mystery" was due to appear on the album in a version recorded with Phil Nicholas and Friday Forever which was an African dance, tribal metal rock version. Complications at the time of original release meant this could not occur and a straightforward rock version was featured instead. The 2006 reissue of "Take the Leap!" includes this previously unreleased version. Tracks from 7 to 14 are completely re-recorded versions of songs taken mostly from Toyah's first three studio albums.
Release and promotion.
The album was originally released in Japan as "Leap!" only on cassette, and was sold at concerts during Toyah's 1993 tour, while a CD version called "Take the Leap!" was released the following year. Toyah went on to tour the album extensively throughout 1994. In 2006, the album was finally released by Edsel Records in the UK with bonus tracks, and consequently original copies of the album have become much sought after.
The album's first ever digital release came in December 2014 when it was made available to download at iTunes and Amazon and to stream via Spotify. To mark the album's twentieth anniversary, and first ever digital release, two EPs of "Take the Leap!"-era material, entitled "Winter in Wonderland " and "Has God Ceased to Dream You", were released in December 2013 and December 2014, respectively. In addition, a free digital EP of bonus material, also pertaining to the "Take the Leap!" album period, entitled "Whisper the Elixir", was issued by Willcox's official website shortly after the release of "Has God Ceased to Dream You". Its tracks were "It's a Mystery" (Whispered Elixir Mix), "It's a Mystery" (Distant Sirens Mix), "It's a Mystery" (Acoustic Poolside) and "Waiting" (Alternate Mix).
In early 2020, the album was included in the "Toyah Solo" box set and reissued on double transparent vinyl. The LP edition omits bonus tracks from the 2006 CD re-release, and instead adds a selection of re-recordings from "Looking Back".

Mister Sterling

Mister Sterling is an American drama television series created by Lawrence O'Donnell for NBC. The series ran from January 10 to March 14, 2003. Starring Josh Brolin as an idealistic United States Senator, the series featured Audra McDonald, William Russ, David Noroña, and James Whitmore as members of his staff. The series aired on Friday nights and despite mostly positive reviews, it was canceled after 9 episodes aired. The show ranked 58th in the yearly ratings (9.83 million viewers, 6.7/12 rating/share).
Although it had numerous similarities to "The West Wing" in style and tone (especially the show's idealistic attitude towards politics) and the unnamed president in the series is stated to be a Democrat, it was not set in the same universe as O'Donnell's other political show. It is unknown if a cross-over would have ever occurred had "Mister Sterling" not been canceled; however Steven Culp played presidential aspirant Sen. Ron Garland on "Mister Sterling" and House Speaker Jeff Haffley on "The West Wing", and Democrats appeared to be in the majority in the US Senate on "Mr Sterling", while in "The West Wing" consistent Republican control of both Houses of Congress was a key plot point.
James Whitmore was nominated for a 2003 Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for playing former Governor Bill Sterling, the senator's father.
The series was produced by Bernadette Joyce, co-producer; Garry A. Brown, co-producer; Michael Dinner, co-executive producer; Sandy Frank, co-producer; Jim Hart, co-executive producer; Jeff Melvoin, co-executive producer; Andrea Newman, producer; Lawrence O'Donnell, executive producer; Chip Vucelich, co-producer; William Bradley, consulting producer.

Sorkhpooshan Delvar Afzar F.C.

Sorkhpooshan Delvar Afzar () was a football team based in Tehran, Iran. They played in the Iranian First Division known as the Azadegan League. They were financially backed by "Delvar Afzar Industrial Group".
They were also the reserve team of Iranian football's one of the most popular clubs, Persepolis F.C. for 2 seasons.
Club history.
The club was originally based in the Iranian province of East Azerbaijan. It was a local club and participated in local club leagues. In 2003, after Ali Parvin left as Persepolis FC's manager, he vowed to never go back, deciding instead to create a new Persepolis. Because Sorkhpooshan is also a nickname of Persepolis FC, and their similar club colors, Parvin along with some other sponsors, bought the team and moved it to Tehran. Former Persepolis players such as Reza Shahroudi joined the team in the 2003–04 season and helped the team reach the Azadegan League. Parvin's dedication to the club was temporary though and he left the club to once again help Persepolis FC. The club was bought by "Delvar Afzar Industrial Group" and had been in the Azadegan League since the 2004–05 season. On September 19, 2006; Sorkhpooshan's chairman signed a contract with Ansarifar, the chairman of Persepolis FC, establishing Sorkhpooshan as Persepolis' reserve team. They plan on exchanging players, having group training sessions, assisting each other in financial matters and to play friend friendlies against each other.

<doc id="7033065" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7033065" title="WHP (AM)">
WHP (AM)

WHP (580 kHz) is a commercial radio station licensed to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, serving the Harrisburg metropolitan area. It broadcasts a talk radio format, and is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. The station's studios are on Corporate Circle in Harrisburg, off North Progress Avenue.
WHP is powered at 5,000 watts, non-directional during the day. To protect other stations on 580 AM from interference at night, it uses a directional antenna with a six-tower array. Its transmitter is on Tower Road near Interstate 81 in East Pennsboro Township. Programming is simulcast on 130-watt FM translator 103.7 W279EC and on the HD2 digital subchannel of sister station 97.3 WRVV.
Programming.
Weekday mornings begin with a news and interview program hosted by R.J. Harris. The show is simulcast on co-owned 1340 WRAW in Reading. The rest of the weekday schedule is from iHeart subsidiary Premiere Networks: "The Glenn Beck Radio Program, The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, The Sean Hannity Show, The Jesse Kelly Show" and "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory". Weekends feature shows on money, health, guns, gardening, travel and technology, some of which are paid brokered programming. Syndicated weekend hosts include "Rich DeMuro on Tech", "Sunday Night with Bill Cunningham" and "Somewhere in Time with Art Bell". Most hours begin with an update from Fox News Radio.
Until July 2022, WHP had a local afternoon drive time host, Ken Matthews. Matthews was named one of the 100 most important talk radio show hosts (the "Heavy Hundred") in America by "Talkers Magazine" in 2020. Another past host on WHP was Bob Durgin, on the station from 1989 to 2013.
History.
WHBG and WMBS.
The Department of Commerce granted John S. Skane a license for a new station, WHBG, on February 20, 1925. It had studios at 2810 North Fourth Street in Harrisburg, transmitting on 1300 kHz. In late 1926, ownership was transferred to Macks Battery Service, and the call sign was changed to WMBS. As of December 31, 1926, the station was reported to be operating on a self-assigned frequency of 833 kHz.
Following the formation of the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), the new regulators issued a series of temporary authorizations beginning on May 3, 1927, with WMBS assigned to 820 kHz. That was changed on June 1, 1927, to 1280 kHz. Stations were also informed that if they wanted to continue operating, they needed to file a formal license application by January 15, 1928, as the first step in determining whether they met the new "public interest, convenience, or necessity" standard. On May 25, 1928, the FRC issued General Order 32, which notified 164 stations, including WMBS, that "From an examination of your application for future license it does not find that public interest, convenience, or necessity would be served by granting it." However, the station successfully convinced the commission that it should remain licensed.
On November 11, 1928, the FRC implemented a major reallocation of station transmitting frequencies, as part of a reorganization resulting from its implementation of General Order 40. WMBS was assigned to 1430 kHz, sharing this frequency with WKBN in Youngstown, Ohio. On October 19, 1928, the FRC granted Mack's Battery Company a construction permit to move the station to 1430 kHz, followed by a new license for operation on the new frequency on January 31, 1929. WMBS was required to share 1430 kHz with WBAK and hence it could not be a full-time station.
WHP.
The station's license was transferred by the FRC to Pennsylvania Broadcasting Company effective March 22, 1929, accompanied by a change in call sign to WHP. On December 1, 1930, the FRC granted another transfer of the license to WHP, Incorporated. On January 26, 1933, WHP was granted full time operation, no longer having to share its frequency. The FRC granted WHP full-time operation (6 am to 1 am) on April 27, 1934.
WHP moved from 1430 kHz to 1460 kHz on March 29, 1941. On that day, 795 US radio stations changed frequency as the result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), signed in Havana with representatives from Canada, US, Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.
For most of its history, WHP was a network affiliate of CBS Radio. It carried CBS's schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the "Golden Age of Radio". In an advertisement in the 1952 "Broadcasting Yearbook", WHP is described as "The Key Station of the Keystone State". The ad says WHP is "welcomed into tens of thousands of homes in Pennsylvania's rich South-Central belt. It is the CBS station serving Harrisburg, Lancaster, York and Lebanon."
FM and TV stations.
In 1946, an FM station was added, WHP-FM. It originally broadcast on 43.5 MHz, moving to 97.3 MHz several months later. In its early years, WHP-FM mostly simulcast the AM station, later switching to beautiful music in the 1960s and is today classic rock WRVV "97.3 The River".
In 1953, a television station was added, WHP-TV, originally on Channel 55 and later on Channel 21. Because WHP had long been a CBS Radio affiliate, WHP-TV carried CBS television programs, along with some shows from the DuMont Television Network.
The Federal Communications Commission granted WHP a construction permit on January 6, 1950, to move the station from 1460 kHz to 580 kHz, followed by a license for operation on the new frequency effective May 1, 1952. The frequency lower on the AM dial gave WHP a stronger signal. The move was coupled with an increase in nighttime power to 5,000 watts, allowing it to cover most of South Central Pennsylvania day and night.
As network programming moved from radio to television in the 1950s and 1960s, WHP switched to a full service, middle of the road (MOR) format of popular adult music, news, talk and sports. In the 1980s, as music listening moved from AM to FM radio, WHP added more talk programming and by the 1990s, it had transitioned to a talk radio station.
iHeart ownership.
In August 1998, the Dame Media stations, including WHP and WRVV, were sold to Clear Channel Communications, the forerunner to iHeartMedia. In 2007, Clear Channel sold WHP-TV and its other television properties to concentrate on radio. WHP-TV is currently owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, even though it continues to share its call letters with WHP radio.
WHP once broadcast using HD Radio technology. Its digital signal was reported off the air as of July 2017. It remains on an FM HD radio subchannel of WRVV.

Dodecahedral conjecture

The dodecahedral conjecture in geometry is intimately related to sphere packing. 
László Fejes Tóth, a 20th-century Hungarian geometer, considered the Voronoi decomposition of any given packing of unit spheres. He conjectured in 1943 that the minimal volume of any cell in the resulting Voronoi decomposition was at least as large as the volume of a regular dodecahedron circumscribed to a unit sphere.
Thomas Callister Hales and Sean McLaughlin proved the conjecture in 1998, following the same strategy that led Hales to his proof of the Kepler conjecture. The proofs rely on extensive computations. McLaughlin was awarded the 1999 Morgan Prize for his contribution to this proof.

Anadarko Basin

The Anadarko Basin is a geologic depositional and structural basin centered in the western part of the state of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, and extending into southwestern Kansas and southeastern Colorado. The basin covers an area of . By the end of the 20th Century, the Anadarko Basin was producing the largest amount of natural gas in the United States. Notable oil and gas fields within the basin include the Hugoton-Panhandle Gas Field, West Edmond Field, Union City Field and the Elk City Field. The basin is also the only commercial source of iodine in the United States and a major producer of helium.
Name.
The name likely comes from either the city of Anadarko, Oklahoma or the Nadaco tribe.
Geology.
The basin is bound on the south by the Wichita-Amarillo uplift, on the east by the Nemaha uplift, on the north by the Central Kansas uplift, and on the west by the Las Animas arch.
Sedimentary rocks from Cambrian through Permian age fill the basin. The sedimentary column is thickest, in excess of , at the southern edge, next to the upfaulted Wichita-Amarillo uplift. The basin has an especially thick section of Pennsylvanian rocks, up to thick. The sedimentary column is only thick on its northern and western flanks.
Natural resources.
Natural gas.
The basin holds one of the most prolific natural gas reserves in North America, with ultimate gas production in excess of of gas. In 2010, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that the Anadarko Basin held 27.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 410 million barrels of natural gas liquids (NGL). An IHS Markit's report estimated more than 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the basin. It is also the 5th largest Natural Gas formation area in the United States.
The Lone Star Bertha Rogers well in Beckham County, Oklahoma held the record as the world's deepest producing well in 1974-1979. It has subsequently been surpassed by several other deep wells, see deepest artificial point. It was drilled to a depth of .
Crude Oil.
In 2010, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that the Anadarko Basin held 495 million barrels of oil. In 2019, IHS Markit estimated that unconventional reservoirs in unrisked technically recoverable resources of the basin account for 16 billion barrels. 
Brine.
The brine in the Pennsylvanian Morrow Formation in the Anadarko Basin contains about 300 parts per million iodine, and is the only current commercial source of that element in the United States. Three companies extract iodine from brine produced as a byproduct of natural gas production from depths of to . Iodine production in 2005 was 1,570 tonnes. The Woodward Iodine company plant is west of Woodward, Oklahoma and uses a deep well north of the city, while the IOCHEM plant east of Vici, Oklahoma extracts the brine from a deep well. North American Brine Resources operates a plant near Dover, Oklahoma.
Helium.
Some natural gas in the basin has unusually high helium content (greater than 0.3%). Helium is recovered from produced natural gas as a byproduct. According to the Bureau of Land Management, Helium reserves in the Anadarko basin account for almost one billion cubic meters.

2001 International Formula 3000 Championship

The 2001 International Formula 3000 Championship was the 35th season of the second-tier motorsport feeder championship of Formula One and the 17th season to be held under the series name. It featured the 2001 FIA International Formula 3000 Championship, a one-make motor racing series, recognised by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), as the second highest class of competition of single seater racing cars. A total of 37 drivers representing 13 teams contested 12 races, starting in Brazil on 31 March and ending in Italy on 15 September as they competed for the Drivers' and Teams' Championships.
The calendar featured two significant changes from the 2000 season. They were the inclusion of a season-opening round at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in Brazil to bring the series to South America for the first time in the modern era and a year-ending race at Italy's Autodromo Nazionale di Monza. Three teams withdrew from the championship before the season: Fortec Motorsport withdrew after they were unable to sign any suitable drivers and desired to focus on other junior series. MySap.com pulled out when owner David Brown left its parent company McLaren to join the Jordan Grand Prix team in Formula One and the World Racing Team withdrew due to a lack of financing and driver stability.
Justin Wilson of the Coca-Cola Nordic Team won three races over the course of the season and secured the Drivers' Championship with one race to go. He became the first British driver in history to win the International Formula 3000 Championship and accumulated a record-breaking 71 points. The runner-up was Super Nova Racing driver Mark Webber, who was 32 points behind Wilson, after a series of accidents eliminated him from title contention in the final third of the season. Wilson's teammate Tomáš Enge in third tied with Webber on championship points with two race victories. Coca-Cola Nordic Team took the Teams' Championship with two rounds remaining, ahead of Petrobras Junior Team and Super Nova Racing.
Teams and drivers.
The following teams and drivers were under contract to compete in the 2001 International Formula 3000 Championship. As the championship was a spec series, all competitors raced with a Lola B99/50 chassis with a V8 engine developed by Zytek. Teams competed with tyres supplied by Avon.
Team changes.
A total of 30 entries spread across 13 teams were initially entered into the championship with the publication of a drivers' list on 2 December 2000. MySap.com withdrew from the championship after its team principal David Brown left its parent company McLaren and moved to the Jordan team in Formula One. Car owner and former sports car driver Gabriele Rafanelli withdrew the World Racing Team (WRT) from the series to focus on the American Le Mans Series operation, tired of F3000 due to a lack of financing and driver stability. European Formula Racing ended its partnership with the Arrows Formula One team, causing team owner Paul Stoddart to re-brand the team European Minardi F3000. Fortec Motorsport were included on the initial entry list before the team withdrew from the championship because they could not locate any suitable drivers to sign and they wanted to focus on other junior series. Prost Grand Prix changed the name of its team from Gauloises Formula to F3000 Prost Junior Team after they lost sponsorship backing from the tobacco company Gauloises.
Driver changes.
The 2001 season saw several driver changes. Defending series champion Bruno Junqueira left the Petrobras Junior Team and moved to Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) to drive for Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR). His teammate Jaime Melo left the team to join Durango on a one-year contract with the option to extend by another season afterwards, partnering series debutant Gabriele Lancieri, who progressed from the Italian Formula 3000 Championship. Italian series champion Ricardo Sperafico drove the second Petrobras car; his twin brother Rodrigo Sperafico moved from the same championship to join Coloni and partnered Fabrizio Gollin. Fabrice Walfisch, who drove for Coloni and later Astromega, joined the European Touring Car Championship in 2001, and André Couto left the series to drive in a Japan-based series. Nordic Racing employed Tomáš Enge from MySap.com to replace the outgoing Kevin McGarrity.
Team Astromega changed their entire line-up. They signed the German Formula Three (GF3) champion Giorgio Pantano to drive his first season in the championship and the WRT driver Ananda Mikola joined him. Driver Fernando Alonso went to Formula One to join Minardi, and Marc Goossens left the team. DAMS also had a new line-up in its team. Franck Montagny switched to the World Series by Nissan and Kristian Kolby competed in the American Indy Lights. The 1997 Barber Dodge Pro Series champion Derek Hill and the Gauloises Formula racer Sébastien Bourdais replaced them. Antonio García graduated from the World Series by Nissan to join the Red Bull Junior Team to pair with GF3 driver Patrick Friesacher. He replaced Enrique Bernoldi, who moved to the Arrows Formula One team. Super Nova Racing signed Mark Webber from European Arrows and Mário Haberfeld from Fortec. European Minardi employed David Saelens from Super Nova, to partner Andrea Piccini, who left Kid Jensen Racing (KJR) after two seasons.
Nicolas Minassian left Super Nova and the series to join CART as teammate to Junqueira at CGR. KJR released Bas Leinders and he moved to KTR to partner Joël Camathias, who transferred from the World Series by Nissan. Financial concerns meant Jeffrey van Hooydonk was unable to secure a seat in the championship and he went to drive in Belcar; his compatriot Yves Olivier and Christijan Albers of European Arrows entered the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters. Italian F3000 competitors Gabriele Varano and Nicolás Filiberti joined the championship by signing for the Prost Junior Team. KJR employed the Formula Palmer Audi driver Justin Keen and Yann Goudy from Italian F3000 to fill the seats vacated by Piccini and Leinders.
Mid-season driver changes.
KJR replaced Yann Goudy with Gianluca Calcagni for the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari round. The team later withdrew from the championship before the Circuit de Catalunya event due to ownership problems and Calcagni driving for them in Imola, which created tension with the series' governing body. Shortly before the A1 Ring round, Ananda Mikola's sponsorship money did not arrive in time at Astromega and a poor performance resulted in Astromega replacing him with Dino Morelli for the next four events. Enrico Toccacelo later drove in Morelli's place for the rest of the season.
Stéphane Sarrazin made a one-off appearance for Prost at the Monaco round as a replacement for Filiberti, who was absent due to "personal issues". Prost later replaced the underperforming Filiberti with Zsolt Baumgartner for the rest of the year from the Nürburgring round and the French Formula Three champion and Porsche Supercup driver Jonathan Cochet drove Variano's car. Prost backed the initiative of one of its major sponsors to promote Latin American drivers in its team and the GF3 series winner Norberto Fontana was drafted in place of Cochet for the season's final three rounds. Before the Monaco round, Red Bull terminated García's contract, and they replaced him with Ricardo Maurício.
European Minardi was represented by the Formula Nippon racer and Jaguar test driver Tomas Scheckter in one of its cars for the Hockenheimring race after Saelens sustained an injury in an accident during the Silverstone event. Rodrigo Sperafico ended his campaign after the same event and was replaced at Coloni by Goossens for the rest of the season with new sponsorship brought to them. García replaced Melo at Durango from the Hungaroring round on, and GF3 driver Jaroslav Janiš drove Enge's Nordic car at the season-ending Monza event, while Enge substituted for Luciano Burti at the Prost Formula One team after the latter was injured at the .
Season calendar.
A 12-race season calendar was released by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA; the series' governing body) at a meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Seville on 4 October 2000. All events were held in support on the Saturday of Formula One races. The series expanded from 10 to 12 races: a South American event to begin the season was at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in Brazil for the series' first race to be held outside of Europe in the modern era. The season-ending round was held at Italy's Autodromo Nazionale di Monza. Drivers and teams had most of June off as the Toyota Atlantic Championship supported the .
Regulation and sporting changes.
Technical changes.
Cars were required to have their wheels attached to their primary structures by means of a single tether for each wheel to prevent them from becoming detached in case of an accident. They also had thick anti-intrusion panels installed onto the monocoque sides.
Sporting changes.
Teams who finished 12th or higher in the 2000 International Formula 3000 Teams' Championship were granted automatic entry into the 2001 series. The final three slots were allocated to new entries or those who had won national Formula 3000 series. Had there been not enough entries via that process, the final three teams in the 2000 season received invitations to compete in the order they finished in the championship. The time for a practice session was lengthened, two 45-minute qualifying sessions held in late afternoon took place the day before the event and the overall race distance was decreased to .
Season report.
Pre-season.
The first official pre-season test took place at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari from 14 to 15 February 2001. The two days saw Wilson lap fastest at 1 minute, 37.850 seconds and he later damaged the rear of his car in a collision with a tyre wall. Fernando Alonso helped Minardi's Formula 3000 team with chassis setup and provided its two drivers with a performance benchmark. A second official pre-season test was held at the Silverstone Circuit between 12 and 13 March 2001. Bourdais led overall for DAMS with a 1 minute, 36.326 seconds lap in variable weather.
Opening rounds.
The season began in Brazil. Brazilian drivers took the first four positions in qualifying with Melo claiming pole position for the first time in his career from Ricardo Sperafico, Rodrigo Sperafico and Pizzonia. The stewards neutralised the race on lap one with the safety car to clear the track when Pizzonia swerved to avoid Ricardo Sperafico's vehicle; the latter swerved to avoid other competitors, causing him to spin and crash into the barrier at the bottom of the Senna S chicane. Melo slowed sharply and allowed Pizzonia, Rodrigo Sperafico and Enge to pass him under safety car conditions. At the lap four restart, Wilson overtook Melo into the first corner, and moved into first when Pizzonia, Rodrigo Sperafico and Enge each incurred ten-second stop-and-go penalties for their earlier transgressions. Wilson led the rest of the race to win in motor racing for the first time since the 1998 Formula Palmer Audi, and was the first British driver to win in International Formula 3000 since Jamie Davies won at the Autodromo di Pergusa in the 1997 season. He lost control of his car afterwards and avoided hitting the pit lane wall. Webber, the pre-season favourite, took second from Melo in third, who had engine problems. The stewards later imposed a 25-second time penalty on Webber for passing David Saelens before the start/finish line after the safety car entered the pit lane for the restart. He moved from second to seventh.
Webber took his first Formula 3000 pole position in qualifying for the Imola round by leading both sessions with Patrick Friesacher second and Darren Manning third. He led every lap of the race to take his first win of the season after he took painkillers to ease the effects of a broken rib. The victory drew him to within one point of Wilson. A crash for Varano after losing control on the kerbs on the exit of the Tamburello chicane caused him to become dizzy and prompted the safety car's deployment. In an accordion effect behind the safety car, Hill made contact with the rear of Calcagni's car, who had turned to the right to avoid hitting slower cars ahead of him. Both drivers avoided hitting marshals tending to Varano. Nordic locked out the front row for the first time at the following race in Spain with Wilson on pole position and his teammate Enge second. Enge passed Wilson at the start of the race at the first turn and maintained the lead throughout a processional round for his second Formula 3000 victory. Enge passed Webber for second in the drivers' championship and was one point behind his teammate Wilson. An error from Wilson allowed Bas Leinders to pass him for second.
The A1 Ring in Austria hosted the fourth round of the 2001 championship. Wet weather affected the second qualifying session and a lap from Sébastien Bourdais in the first session was fast enough to earn him the second pole position of his career. A first-lap collision between Bourdais and Friesacher at Castrol Kurve corner caused eight cars to retire and allowed Leinders to move into the lead, just as Wilson progressed to second. After a safety car period to clear the area, Wilson passed Leinders on the outside on the fifth lap and he held off the latter to win for the second time in International Formula 3000. The victory further extended Wilson's championship lead to seven points over his Nordic teammate Enge. During qualifying at Monaco Webber took a second pole position of 2001 despite crashing at the outside of La Rascasse turn late in the second session in a desire to better his lap. Webber held off Wilson at the start of the race and led every lap for his second victory of the year by eight-tenths of a second. Webber thus overtook Enge for second position in the drivers' championship. Two safety car periods for a first lap five-car accident at a hairpin and for separate crashes involving Darren Manning and Antônio Pizzonia slowed the race.
Mid-season.
Heading into round six, Wilson led Webber in second by eleven points and was another two points in front of the third-placed Enge. Pole position for the Nürburgring event was taken by Enge after a duel with Webber and Ricardo Sperafico. Wilson was down in seventh place after he ran wide at a chicane. Enge was unchallenged throughout a noncompetitive race and achieved his second win of the season. The result moved Enge past Webber and into second position in the championship. He stood three points behind his teammate Wilson, who spun into a gravel trap and subsequently retired with a sheared peg on the front-left wheel. One week later at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours in France, Enge carried his form over from the Nürburgring round to qualify on pole position for the second race in succession on his second lap of the session with no slower traffic to impede him. Webber, Patrick Friesacher and Wilson were in positions two to four. Webber overtook Enge at the first corner to take the lead and Wilson passed Freisacher for third position. Webber pulled away from the rest of the field to claim victory and drew to within one championship point of Wilson, who finished second after Enge ran wide at a hairpin on the final lap.
Enge took another pole position when he set the fastest lap, ahead of his teammate Wilson and Bourdais at the Silverstone round in the United Kingdom. A major airborne accident at Becketts corner involving Saelens in qualifying caused a long stoppage to allow for him to be extricated from his car with FIA doctor Sid Watkins supervising. Saelens was transported to Northampton General Hospital and was withdrawn from the race with ninth vertebrae and wrist ligament damage. In the race, the Nordic cars of Enge and Wilson collided at Stowe turn on the fourth lap. Wilson ran wide onto the gravel and this elevated Bourdais to second position. A brief rain shower on lap nineteen caused Enge to go onto the gravel at Copse corner and Bourdais took the lead. He held off Wilson to take his first Formula 3000 victory as Enge's engine cut out on the final lap and gave his compatriot Antônio Pizzonia third.
Final rounds.
Ricardo Sperafico beat Wilson by 0.071 seconds to achieve the first pole position of his career in the next round at the Hockenheimring. Sperafico had excess wheelspin off the line; he kept the lead by blocking Wilson, who lost second place to his teammate Enge. Wilson and Pizzonia subsequently took first and second before the latter passed the former on lap three. Pizzonia lead the rest of the race to win for the first time in the series. A second-place result for Wilson and a non-finish for Webber after hitting the rear of Darren Manning's car increased his lead to ten points in the championship. The season resumed three weeks later at the Hungaroring in Hungary. Wilson emerged ahead of Webber in qualifying with pole position, and broke away from the start as Webber had less grip and fell behind Enge and Mauricio. Enge delayed Webber until he made an error at the final turn and the latter passed him. This resulted in contact between Enge and Webber and the latter was imposed a ten-second stop-and-go penalty dropping him to eleventh. With four laps remaining, Webber beached his car upon a kerb and promoted Bourdais to third. Wilson took his third career victory with a margin of 5 seconds over Mauricio. He extended his championship lead over Webber to 20 points and Nordic won the Teams' Championship with two races to go.
Going into the Spa-Francorchamps round, Webber needed to win the final two races and for Wilson not to score any points to win the drivers' championship on countback with more race victories. Wilson required a sixth-place result in either race to secure the title regardless of where Webber finished. Petrobras took the first two positions in qualifying with Ricardo Sperafico on pole position and his teammate Antônio Pizzonia second. Wilson and Webber could only manage third and fifth respectively. The race began in inclement weather and the safety car was used for two laps to allow competitors to familiarise themselves with the wet track. An accident for Webber at Eau Rouge corner early on saw his car destroyed and him taken to a hospital in Verviers for a precautionary x-ray scan that discovered knee ligament damage and no fractured bones. Wilson finished second to clinch the drivers' title with one race remaining as Sperafico led every lap of the event to achieve his first career win. Wilson was the first British driver in history to win the International Formula 3000 Championship.
At the season-ending Autodromo Nationale di Monza race, a deluge caused localised flooding and strong winds blowing natural debris onto the circuit forced the postponement of qualifying. Qualifying was reformatted as a solitary 20-minute session on Saturday afternoon and the race began half an hour later than scheduled. Pizzonia qualified on pole position for the first time in his career and he was joined on the grid's front row by Wilson in second. The start was aborted twice and delayed for 23 minutes because several drivers stalled their cars on the grid. Pantano emerged a Formula 3000 race winner for the first time in his career after he overcame being put onto the grass by Pizzonia at the start, a manoeuvre which entailed a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for the latter. Wilson went on to finish second and Ricardo Sperafico placed third.
Wilson finished on 71 points with Webber and Enge tied for second position with 39 points each. He eclipsed the record of Juan Pablo Montoya from the 1998 season with the most points accumulated in an International Formula 3000 season, which he kept until Björn Wirdheim improved on it en route to winning the 2003 championship.

Battle of Frastanz

The Battle of Frastanz between an army of the Old Swiss Confederacy and the troops of King Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire took place on 20 April 1499. In one of the many raids of the Swabian War, an expedition of Habsburg troops had plundered some villages in the Swiss Confederacy, who responded by sending an army to Vorarlberg. At Frastanz, a few kilometers south-east of Feldkirch, the Habsburg troops had blocked the entry to the Montafon valley with a strong wooden fortification called a "Letzi". The Swiss used a flanking maneuver to bypass the "Letzi" and after a hard battle routed Maximilian's army. Many "Landsknechte" drowned in the river Ill.
The battle.
Because a frontal assault on the strong fortifications at Frastanz seemed futile, the commander of the Swiss troops, Heinrich Wolleb from Uri, devised an alternate battle plan. Some 2,000 men were to cross the Roya mountain, clear it from Tyrolean troops, and then attack the main camp of the Habsburg army from the side. Another 5,000 men under the command of Count Ulrich von Sax were to advance at the foot of the mountain and then meet the first group, also attacking from the mountain above and behind the "Letzi". Some 1,600 men from the Grisons would stay put to keep the garrison at Feldkirch at bay.
Wolleb's troop was quickly engaged by the Tyrolean soldiers, but managed to drive them down the mountain. At a place called Fellengatter, they met again with the other part of the Swiss army. The Habsburg troops, amongst them many "Landsknechte" of the Swabian League, attacked them, but when the Swiss charged from their higher ground, the Swabian battle line collapsed. Accounts vary; some claim the fight was long and hard, others mention that the Swiss overran the "Landsknechte". Heinrich Wolleb fell by a gun bullet. The Swiss ultimately drove the Habsburg soldiers back. On their flight, many drowned in the river Ill, which ran high due to the snowmelt in spring.
The Swiss camped three days at the battlefield and plundered and burned the villages in the area.

Pickering College

Pickering College is an independent, co-educational school for children in grades from Junior Kindergarten through grade 12. It is located in Newmarket, Ontario in Canada on a 17-hectare (42 acre) property on Bayview Avenue. The school accepts both day students and boarders (Grade 7 through Grade 12 only).
Pickering College is the second oldest independent school in Ontario, after Upper Canada College.
Pickering College is also the site of the Quaker Archives and Library of Canada which are housed in the Arthur Garratt Dorland Reference Library.
History.
Bloomfield (West Lake), Prince Edward County, 1841.
Campus.
The roots of Pickering College trace far back into the 19th century in Bloomfield, a significant Quaker settlement near Picton at West Lake, in Prince Edward County. There, on property (lot 13, concession 2, Military Tract) purchased by Israel Bowrman, a Quaker, a school (or seminary) was eventually established.
It is said that around this time Joseph John Gurney, a prominent Quaker Englishman (considered a 'minister', in the Quaker sense of the term), and brother of Elizabeth Fry, herself a noted advocate of social and prison reform, offered the sum of 500 pounds to the Religious Society of Friends for the establishment of a school there, if they could raise a similar amount.
It is not immediately clear when the building that eventually became the West Lake Boarding School (and still stands today as a private residence) was actually erected. Mr. Bowrman mortgaged the property in 1830, and it is possible these funds were used to build what might have originally been intended as a house, later converted to a school. In either case, in 1841 the building began official use as a school, welcoming first only girls, and later, in 1842, with the construction of a wood framed building to the east, boys.
The main building served three purposes: its top floor served as dormitory for students, the basement served as dining room and servants' quarters, and the first floor acted as classroom and administrative facilities. For its time, the building was rather advanced in some respects, including indoor plumbing featuring a septic tank built of large red cedar logs.
There were a number of other buildings on the property including the boys' residence and other utility buildings, none of which remains today. Compared to the facilities of some of its contemporaries, West Lake Boarding School's were somewhat modest and more remote.
Operation.
In 1848 this school was registered under the name West Lake Friends' or Quakers' Seminary. That it was coeducational was due to the Quakers' belief in the need to educate both sexes. The school was primarily administered and guided by the Quakers and it was non-denominal in nature.
According to historical sources, the school at West Lake was closed in 1865 due to lack of enrollment, partly on account of its difficult accessibility at the time. The property was sold in 1869.
In 1871 the Ontario legislature passed an Act to Incorporate the Trustees of the Friends' Seminary of the Province of Ontario. The Act stated that it was "the opinion of the said yearly meeting of Friends that the usefulness of the said Seminary would be largely increased by changing its location to the Township of Pickering near the village of Duffins Creek". The Act received royal assent on February 15, 1871 and a few years later, construction would begin on the new and modern school in Pickering.
Pickering Village, 1877.
Campus.
In 1877 a successor to the original school near West Lake was constructed on Conc. 2, Lot 13, near the Village of Pickering. It would be a grand building, situated on 2 ha (5 acres) high atop a hill and visible to the town below. It would also be known as a landmark along what was then known as Old Kingston Road, and later as Highway 2.
The main school building, four storeys high in red and white brick [ref], was to be built by an Oshawa contractor for a relatively frugal sum of $24,300 (close to $475,000 in 2006 dollars). It featured a slate roof, arched windows, and a classic belltower over the centre section. It featured two wings that ran some 24 m (80 ft) behind the building, housing up to 75 boarding students, with the girls situated on the east side, boys on the west. The Principal and Matron of the school occupied a wing to the north, complete with living facilities and library. The centre of the school featured a large study room, with a stage for entertainment. It was also used for meetings of the Pickering College Literary Society. The second floor was exclusively classrooms and the third and fourth floors housed the students and teachers. In the basement were the kitchen and dining areas, along with the school's modern science laboratory. The school was said to enjoy a commanding view of its surroundings, including the Village of Pickering below.
The schoolhouse never acquired electricity (electricity was not available in the area, even in the early 20th century). For heat, the building relied on stoves until 1883, when steam heat became available. Indoor plumbing arrived only around 1905, the last year of the building's existence. A former student, Arthur Dorland recalled later in an interview:
"About the time I arrived at the school, inside plumbing had been installed and toilet accommodation had been modernized and enlarged. An adequate supply of water was also ensured by the erection of a windmill at Duffins Creek. which delivered some eight thousand gallons of water daily. This was in addition to the reserve supply in the main well and cisterns at the school. Nevertheless, we still used pitchers and basins in our rooms for washing and we filled our own jugs at a tap in the bathroom."
Having no electricity, the school had no electric lights. "Consequently, coal-oil lamps were used throughout the school for illumination. This presented a serious fire hazard, for oil lamps were always liable to be knocked over, and many a glass chimney was smashed to smithereens in a pillow fight or similar fracas". This dangerous situation was corrected by the installation of an acetelyne gas plant, eliminating the need for the lamps altogether.
In 1899, Sam Rogers (not to be confused with the English poet Samuel Rogers who died 44 years earlier), a Quaker descendant of Timothy Rogers (who had originally helped settle Pickering Village with a number of Quaker families in the early 19th century) donated funds to build an impressive gymnasium to add to the amenities. This building was done in an imposing Greek revival style with high arched windows, and a portico at the front with a roof supported by four large pillars. It would be the only major addition to facilities at the main campus, and would outlive the schoolhouse by some 82 years.
Operation.
Although Pickering College had its roots in the original Friend's Seminary at West Lake, and remained primarily populated by Quaker staff, students, and administrators, the school in fact welcomed students from all walks of life. The students tended to come from families of decent means, as the tuition cost ($165.00 per year in 1893) was considerable to those of lower income, including children of agrarian families, for whom an education was considered unnecessary, since they were expected to maintain their family farms.
The school was guided by the Friends' belief in a high standard of education that emphasized all aspects of human development – academic, spiritual and physical: "The object of Pickering College [was] to secure to its students as thorough an education as can be obtained outside of a University or of a professional school, and at the same time to surround them with all the moral influences and guarded care of a well-conducted home."
The school's emphasis on a well-rounded education included ample opportunities for rigorous exercise: ball fields, rinks and courts, and later the gymnasium surrounded the building. Popular sports included "Association football as well as rugby, where the rules of that day were not so restricted as they are to day, were modified by the good moral atmosphere-for the most part-of the college." The athletic program was not merely extracurricular: "It [was] the chief aim of...the teachers to encourage in students a love of outside exercise, and no pains [would] be spared by the [Friends] Committee to make this a prominent feature of the institution, so that the health of the students may be secured in the best possible way, viz. by fresh air and outdoor recreation."
The school operated until 1885, when litigation between a number of Quaker bodies forced the school to close. The matter settled, the school reopened in 1892, and apparently enjoyed great success: "Mr. W. P. Firth M.A., D.Sc., became principal. With his wife, formerly Miss Ella Rogers B.A., daughter of Samuel Rogers, a well known Toronto figure at that time the school prospered, and attendance grew rapidly. Students came from all over the Continent, as well as from Japan, Russia, China, Persia, Armenia, Australia, Central America and the West Indies. A large number of Jamaicans graduated from the school. Many local students attended both the preparatory, as well as the collegiate departments. In the early nineties the attendance taxed the capacity of the building." Such was the success of the school in the late 1890s that an alumni event in 1894 gathered some 400 students from all over the country.
A number of notable graduates hailed from Pickering College, including university professors, Reverends and businessmen. The school had a business program that was described as "world-class", and even boasted a typewriting class, a first for a North American school. An excellent fine arts program was nourished at the school. The Pickering College Literary society met weekly for "musical recitals, poetry readings, discussions and debates on current issues." The school kept up a column in the local Pickering News "inviting the public to attend special meetings when the Society had a speaker".
The Village of Pickering also enjoyed a close and intimate relationship with the school — many businesses and trades supplied the College's needs, and the Village itself supplied a number of students. An example of the trade links between school and village was a man by the name of William Peak, "who ran a "taxi service" from the Grand Trunk Railway station to the College transporting students".
Thus was nourished a great affection for the school both in the Village of Pickering and in its alumni, of whom could be said "that no institution of learning [had] a more loyal body of graduates than Pickering College." This joyful and exciting time was about to be drawn to a dramatic and tragic close.
Fire.
On December 30, 1905, a catastrophic fire broke out in the main building of the College. Although the exact cause was never determined, it was known that the blaze began in the Principal's quarters, and, stoked by high winds, the fire quickly consumed the brick building's wooden inner frame and structure. By dawn the next day, all that remained of the once great school were the charred brick outer walls, along with the Gymnasium, the stables, and a few other brick outbuildings. Nearly all of the school's contents, including valuable records and equipment, were destroyed.
The extent of the damage was enormous; over $50,000 in 1905 dollars, with some $4,000 alone attributed to the loss of the Principal's (Mr. Firth's) library. Rebuilding costs were estimated to be another $30,000 or more over and above that number. Adding to the financial strain was that the school was actually underinsured at the time, the amount actually covered by insurance being less than $13,000.
The fire of 1905 was to have consequences both for the school and for the Village of Pickering itself. A debate over the future of the school ensued, with many alumni, the Village of Pickering itself (fearing a loss of business and tax revenue) and others wishing to rebuild the College on its original site. A period of time passed where the College committee reviewed its options. For a time, Pickering remained the favourite; the local newspaper reported plans to rebuild the school on the same site, even larger than before, with a near doubling of capacity for boarding students. However, this was not to be. A number of towns expressed interest in hosting the College and were perhaps more vocal than the Village of Pickering had been. A new option would eventually come to the fore: the tiny town of Newmarket.
With its larger Quaker community, direct rail link to Toronto, and the ready availability of services to the future campus, logic seemed to dictate a move there, and in 1908, sadness and objections of Alumni notwithstanding, the decision was made to relocate and rebuild the college in Newmarket.
Disposition of the Pickering Property.
The old grounds of Pickering College at Pickering were eventually sold at a distressed price of $11.00 per acre (for a total of $550.00) to a man by the name of Ernest L. Ruddy. Mr. Ruddy, who hailed from Toronto, also bought the surrounding lands for approximately $4320. 16. Ruddy converted the former gymnasium into a large, lavish summer home, complete with mezzanine, four bedrooms created in part by splitting the original single storey building into two. An artesian well was placed close by. Mr. Ruddy called the property 'The Hermitage', and it would continue to serve him and his family until 1960, when it was sold.
The property slowly became derelict in the years following, with the building falling into a serious state of disrepair. Local interest in restoring the former property grew steadily, but no one appeared willing or able to put forward the required $400,000 estimated cost of repair. Passionate supporters of restoration argued that the former residence/school gym was one of few remaining reminders of what had helped put Pickering on the map in the first place, and that the cost was well worth the value in preserving a unique piece of Pickering Village's history. This did not appear to garner much support with the town council of the time: the council felt the structure would be of little value to the community once restored, since there were still no services onsite. The building continued to deteriorate.
A Final Fire.
On October 4, 1987, 110 years after the erection of the original Pickering College and 82 years after its destruction, the sole survivor of the old campus also succumbed to fire. The fire began in the evening and completely consumed the building; leaving only the Ruddy family's "wishing well" standing afterwards. With arson suspected, some recriminations followed. Many mourned the loss of a piece of Pickering history, feeling it was a loss that could have been prevented.
Ultimately the property did become a housing development, with only a small portion, designated the "Hermitage Park" remaining. A replica of the original Ruddy well was placed at the site. Of the old school at Pickering Village, nothing would remain. The grounds of the former campus are today mostly covered by modern housing.
Campus.
The Pickering College name by the early 20th Century had become well established and known in many parts of the world, so despite the move to Newmarket, the old name was retained. A new school building was constructed, once again atop a commanding hill (hence the school's nickname – The Hilltop) and the College reopened in 1909. The striking new four storey building in Newmarket — named Rogers House in honour of Sam Rogers' and his family's contributions to the school — bore similarities to the old one in function (it served both as dormitory and schoolhouse), however it was very different in design. The building's architect was a young John Lyle, who also collaborated on Toronto's Union Station. As in his contribution to Union Station, Lyle included a Georgian-style façade featuring four large pillars. Lyle also suggested a dome for the new building, but this was declined by the Friends, who probably felt it too decadent. Nonetheless, the new building would become a Newmarket landmark, instantly recognizable; its majesty symbolic of great belief the Friends had in a solid education. The four Romanesque columns that adorned the front of the building were eventually given the names Faith, Freedom, Friendship and Fun, to further emphasize the cornerstones of the school's philosophy and educational approach.
As anticipated, the school prospered in its new location. Enrollment gradually increased from opening until a number of years later, when the First World War began to impact on enrolment. In 1916, enrolment declined significantly and the school was closed. The Friends then lent the school property and buildings to the Military Hospital Commission rent-free until other facilities could be built.
Since 1878, the school had operated under the auspices of the Canada Yearly Meeting of Friends. In 1917, an act of the Provincial Legislature transferred the assets, endowments, and property of Pickering College to an independent corporation: still primarily administered and guided by the Friends.
In 1927, for the first time, Pickering College became a boys-only school, and would remain so for the next 65 years. Under Headmaster Joseph McCulley, the school married its traditional Quaker teachings to the progressivism of John Dewey, which called for greater emphasis on problem solving and critical thinking skills rather than rote learning.
As part of the property, adjacent to the campus, a fully operational farm provided food for the school kitchen. In the wintertime, the fields and the slopes down to them could be used by the students for skiing and sledding. More recently, the farm has become a housing development.
Over the years, additions were made to the campus, including the addition of a gymnasium to Rogers House. In 1930, a new residential building which also included two classrooms was built and dedicated to former principal William Firth as Firth House, further adding to the school's capacity for boarding students. Further additions included a running track, four playing fields, and an ice rink. A new dining hall was added in the 1960s. A new student lounge was constructed adjacent to the concourse between Rogers house and the dining hall. A health center is located in New House, staffed by a school nurse, who is on call 24 hours a day for the needs of boarding students.
Current facilities also include a baseball diamond, newly constructed athletic complex and an off-site equestrian facility. The school has a CRTC-licensed radio station and recording studio (102.7 CHOP FM).
Fire.
Rogers House has been involved in two fires, the second time causing extensive damage.
In 1979, fire broke out in the Master's apartment in the Lower South corridor. The fire was caused by a smouldering candle. Student Harry Albright, who was on a spare period in his room opposite the apartment, smelled the smoke and raised the alarm. The fire had already taken hold, but thanks to the quick response of the fire department, damage was confined to the apartment and minor smoke damage on the corridor.
In November, 1981, in a near-repeat of the events of 1905, fire again broke out in Rogers House. Due to some of the more primitive materials used in the building's original construction, the fire accelerated quickly and caused extensive damage to the southern wing of the building and water damaged the school throughout. Thankfully the events of 1905 were not repeated, and the year that followed saw the school embark on a major reconstruction and renovation program.
While construction progressed, a number of the boarding students, along with some classrooms, were temporarily relocated to trailers on the school property. This became somewhat affectionately known as 'Trailer City'.
Ultimately the fire brought about the end of Rogers House's long existence as both dormitory and schoolhouse. Save for the Headmaster's house attached to the back of the building, there would be no living quarters in Rogers House, which from this point forward would house only classrooms, laboratories and the school's administration offices. Drawing from some of the lessons of the 1981 fire, in 1983 a brand new, three storey residence (dubbed New House) for teachers and students was constructed using a cinderblock design to render the building as fireproof as possible. The end of the 1980s also saw the complete renovation of Firth House, again changing the function of a formerly dual-use building – classrooms in Firth House were eliminated in favour of new residences for teachers and the building became entirely residential in nature.
The 1990s.
In 1992 Pickering College celebrated its Sesquicentennial (150th anniversary). Changes included the addition of a lower school (Junior Kindergarten to Grade 6) to the existing middle (Grade 7 and 8) and upper schools (at the time, Grade 9 to OAC).
1992 would also mark the return of coeducation to Pickering College, after nearly seven decades as a boys-only school, with the admission of girls to the lower school. The following year, coeducation was extended to the entire school. After 1992, Firth House would no longer house male students — it became an exclusively female dormitory, with New House remaining for the boys.
The late 1990s again saw upgrades and renovations to campus facilities.
The Present.
With the completion of the new athletic complex (named Egan House as of Sep 30, 2006, in honour of the key role played by the Egan Family Foundation in raising funds for its construction), Pickering College has attained an impressive array of student facilities, while retaining much of its traditional Quaker heritage and approach to learning.
The school continues to foster athletic achievement: a mandatory after-school activity program ensures that a Pickering student receives excellent physical exercise or a way to express themselves in several different arts-related fields, as well as academic instruction. A drive to expand the physical campus is also underway.
Tuition and Scholarships.
Pickering College offers bursaries for students based on financial need, and scholarships based on academic merit and/or evidence of personal qualities and talents that add positive influences to the school.
Government, Faculty and Staff.
Pickering College is incorporated under an act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The Corporation of Pickering College, whose 35 members are drawn from the school's extended community is responsible for electing the Pickering College Board of Directors, which in turn reports to the Corporation. The Corporation does not act in a policy or governance role, but rather acts similarly to a senate, primarily in the role of watchdog and "chamber of sober second thought". It approves the Boards' financial statements at the Annual General Meeting.
The Board of Directors has 10 members who are elected from the membership of the Corporation for terms of 3 years. These are also drawn from the ranks of the school's extended community and can include alumni and past faculty. The Board establishes the school's vision, mission and strategic plan, appoints the Headmaster and conducts annual performance reviews, as well as overseeing the school's financial affairs. The Board ultimately reports to the Corporation. As of 2016, the Chair of the Board of Directors is Kelly Mason.
Pickering College faculty consists of Masters (teachers) with a diverse range of qualifications, supervised by the Headmaster. Some faculty (including the Headmaster) live on campus in campus-supplied housing, most live in and around the immediate community. In addition to their regular teaching role Masters also act as academic counsellors for groups of students, overseeing their academic and general progress throughout the school year.
Also among faculty are Junior Masters (tutors) who are often drawn from abroad and assist Masters inside and outside the classroom.

Pickering as a filming location.
The Pickering College ice rink is the scene of at least one film and one commercial. In the romantic comedy film "The Cutting Edge" (1992), starring D. B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly, the rink masquerades as the private training arena of Kelly's leading character.
Pickering College is also featured very briefly in the film "The Big Hit" (1998), as the high school from which Keiko Nishi (played by China Chow), is kidnapped. Other films that have included location-filming at Pickering College are "Blown Away" (1992) and "A Life Less Gone" (2008).
Houses.
There are four houses in Pickering College: Gold, Silver, Red and Blue. Each student is randomly assigned to one of the houses upon enrolment. Houses are led by two House Chairs, elected students in grades 11 and 12. The house with the most points at the end of the year is awarded the house banner.

Jack O'Connor (Gaelic footballer)

Jack O'Connor (born 23 October 1960) is an Irish Gaelic football manager and former player. He has been manager of the senior Kerry county team since 2021, having earlier managed it over two terms in the 2000s.
O'Connor played football with his local club, Dromid Pearses, from the 1970s until the early 2000s. As manager, he guided Kerry to five All-Ireland SFC titles: in 2004, 2006, 2009, 2022, and 2025, during his three terms as manager. Kerry also won the National Football League in all of those years
Early life.
Born in 1960 at Toorsaleen in Mastergeehy County Kerry. The youngest of nine children born to Michael and Síle O'Connor, he was educated locally at Caslagh national school before later attending Scoil Uí Chonaill in Cahersiveen. It was here that O'Connor's football skills were developed and he was picked for the Kerry vocational schools team in 1977 and 1978. Defeats of Kildare and Mayo respectively gave O'Connor back-to-back All-Ireland winners' medals in this competition.
After completing his secondary education O'Connor moved on to Maynooth College where he obtained a B.A, H.dip Ed in Spanish and Irish. 
Work and family.
O'Connor's first teaching job was at Waterville Tech. He progressed from there to his alma mater, Scoil Ui Chonaill, where he remained on the teaching staff until 1999. Here O'Connor became involved in training the school's football team and he enjoyed much success as a coach. In 1997 he guided Scoil Uí Chonaill to the Kerry county title in the vocational schools championship. A Munster title quickly followed before an All-Ireland final showdown with St. Malachy's from Castlewellan. O'Connor's side were victorious on that occasion.
He managed Kerry County Vocational Schools Teams to All-Ireland wins in 1992 and 93.
The amalgamation of the three schools in Cahersiveen in 1999 led to the creation of Coláiste na Sceilge. O'Connor remained on the teaching staff while also holding on to his position as coach of the school's football team. In 1999 he guided the school to another set of county and provincial vocational titles while another All-Ireland final appearance beckoned. Holy Trinity College provided the opposition on that occasion, however, victory went to the Kerry team. In 2000 Coláiste na Sceilge made history when they retained their county, Munster and All-Ireland vocational titles.
Further success followed for O'Connor's youngsters in the early 2000s. Coláiste na Sceilge won three consecutive Corn Uí Mhuirí titles in 2001, 2002 and 2003, however, the team fell in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final on all three occasions. After a prolonged absence O'Connor guided his school team to a fourth Corn Uí Mhuirí title in 2009. At the fourth attempt Coláiste na Sceilge reached the All-Ireland final. St Mary's of Edenderry provided the opposition, however, the Kerry youngsters were too strong and won the game by 1–9 to 0–10. It was a first Hogan Cup title for Coláiste na Sceilge.
In March 2007, O'Connor published his autobiography, "Keys to the Kingdom".
 He is married to Bridie (née Moriarty), and has two sons – Cian (born 1989) and Éanna (born 1992). The latter was a member of the Kerry minor football team in 2009. Cian and Éanna have both since played for Moorefield in County Kildare, and Éanna has shown interest in playing for his adopted county.
Playing career.
Club.
O'Connor played his club football with Dromid Pearses and has enjoyed some success. As a player and a coach with the club for over twenty years he helped them progress through the ranks in Kerry football from Division 5 to Division 1.
In 1981 he was a member of the South Kerry team that reached the final of the county senior championship. On that occasion the divisional side accounted for the famed Austin Stacks club. O'Connor collected a county winners' medal as a non-playing substitute.
In 1982 O'Connor was still confined to the substitutes' bench as South Kerry contested a second consecutive county final. Feale Rangers, a division from the northern part of the county, provided the opposition. O'Connor's side were far too strong and recorded back-to-back county titles.
Three-in-a-row proved beyond O'Connor's divisional side, however, South Kerry were back in the county championship decider again in 1984 with O'Connor making it onto the starting fifteen. A Páidí Ó Sé-trained West Kerry team defeated the men from the south on that occasion.
In 1999 O'Connor captured a county novice championship title with Dromid Pearses.
Managerial career.
Kerry (first term, 2003-2006).
Jack became Kerry manager in the autumn of 2003, after the sacking of Páidí Ó Sé. He won the All-Ireland twice in his first term, in 2004 and 2006, defeating Mayo in the final on both occasions. Kerry also won the National Football League in both of those years, as well as reaching the final in 2005, where they lost to Tyrone. O'Connor considered resigning after Kerry's 2006 victory, although county board chairman Seán Walsh wanted him to stay on. O'Connor finally stepped down, along with his backroom staff (selectors Ger O'Keeffe and Johnny Culloty, and trainer Pat Flanagan) on 16 October 2006. His final decision to step down as the manager was said to be for personal reasons. Seán Walsh was disappointed by the final decision but made a point of acknowledging O'Connor's successes as manager. Few managers achieved his successes in such a short period of time; two all-Irelands, two Munster Championships and two National League Division One titles. O'Connor was the first Kerry manager to take Kerry to three All-Ireland finals since Mick O'Dwyer.
Kerins O'Rahillys.
After taking a break from management for a year he took over Tralee club side Kerins O'Rahilly's in 2008 whom he led to the Munster Club Championship Final but lost out to Nemo Rangers of Cork. He also led them to the Kerry County Final against Mid Kerry, losing in the replay.
Kerry (second term, 2009-2012).
After Pat O'Shea's resignation as Kerry Manager he was confirmed as manager for the 2009 campaign. On 26 April 2009, he managed Kerry to win the Allianz NFL Division 1 title, beating Derry 1–15 to 0–15 in the final at Croke Park.
On 20 September 2009, he managed Kerry to win their 36th All-Ireland Senior Football title with a four-point win over Cork in Croke Park.
Despite being written off by many of the games experts O'Connor's men proved their worth first with a stunning quarter-final victory over Dublin and from that point on never looked back and went on to beat Meath in the semi-final before claiming the title against Cork. O'Connor said 'There is a lot of satisfaction in this, we were being written off by many experts".
On 30 August 2010, O'Connor reappointment as manager was ratified by the Kerry county committee in Tralee, which agreed to a new three-year term for the management team.
On 11 August 2012, O'Connor stepped down as Kerry manager for the second time despite pressure from the County Board for him to stay.
Kerry minors.
On 31 August 2013, O'Connor was appointed as Kerry minor manager taking over from Mickey Ned O'Sullivan on a two-year term.

Charles T. Lanham

Major General Charles Trueman Lanham (September 14, 1902 – July 20, 1978), known as "Buck", was an author, poet, and professional soldier in the United States Army, winning 14 decorations in his career. After retiring from the military, he was active in corporate business. He is the model for one of Ernest Hemingway's heroes, and in life was a close friend of the author.
Military life.
Lanham was born in Washington D. C. He attended Eastern High School and graduated from West Point in 1924. He was a short story writer and published poet (writing sonnets for several magazines) as well as a soldier. He included among his many military adventures the command of the 22nd Infantry Regiment in Normandy in July 1944, and was the first American officer to lead a break through the Siegfried Line on September 14, 1944, near Buchet. These developments were described by Hemingway in his article "War in the Siegfried Line". He led a breakout in the Battle of the Bulge after surviving a bloody ordeal in the Battle of Hurtgen Forest. Lanham earned the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions in the Huertgen Forest. The citation for the medal reads:
It was in the Normandy battles that Lanham and Ernest Hemingway first met, and Hemingway later went with Lanham to Huertgen. Hemingway was writing battlefield stories for the American audience for "Collier's" and sought assignment with Lanham's regiment. Hemingway described Lanham as "The finest and bravest and most intelligent military commander I have known."
Conversely, one of his least-admired decisions came with the awarding of the Combat Infantryman Badge to his men. Many men in the 22nd Infantry had landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day, but Lanham rejected this date and made awards of the badge effective no earlier than August 10, 1944, which deprived the men of an additional $10 per month for the full period in which they fought. His reason "What ever happened in this regiment before I took command does not concern me."
While serving as Assistant Division Commander, 104th Infantry Division, Lanhan was decorated with the Order of the Patriotic War First Class when the division linked up with Soviet Red Army units in May 1945.
Post-military life.
Lanham retired from the military at the end of 1954 as a major general, and joined the Pennsylvania-Texas Corporation of Colt's Patent Firearms. He resigned in 1958 and joined Xerox in 1960 as vice president for Government Relations, retiring from that post at the end of 1970. He died on July 20, 1978, in Chevy Chase, Maryland, from cancer at the age of 76. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.
In fiction.
Colonel "Buck" Lanham was one of the models for the character Colonel Cantwell in Hemingway's novel "Across the River and into the Trees", along with Charles Sweeny and Hemingway himself.

Boiling Springs State Park

Boiling Springs State Park is a park built northeast of Woodward, Oklahoma, USA. It was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s.
History.
The park originated in the 1930s and was named for its springs. It was constructed as a park from the natural environment by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The park received its current name because its sandy-bottom springs appear to be boiling because of the inrush of subsurface water. The water temperature is actually far cooler than boiling.
Native Americans, Spanish explorers, and pioneers have visited and inhabited the land used for the park. Spanish expeditions from Mexico are believed to have visited the area as early as 1541 as part of Francisco Vázquez de Coronado’s search for the fabled "Seven Cities of Gold". In 1641, another Spanish explorer – Juan de Oñate - reported that several Indian encampments were found near the cool springs and heavy timber of the area. In 1823, U.S. Cavalry General Thomas James established a fur trading post here. Captain Nathan Boone, son of Daniel Boone, explored the vicinity of the park in 1843 on an expedition originating from Fort Gibson in eastern Oklahoma. Pioneers flocking into this area during the land run of 1893 found the location quite suitable for farming and hunting. In the early 1900s, area residents were just beginning to find and enjoy the recreation potential of this site.
In 1935, much of the land comprising the present day park was acquired by the City of Woodward to provide a place for recreation for its citizens and visitors. Although the local "swimming hole" was already present, the primary development work was accomplished by the young men of Company 2822 of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) from 1935 to 1939. A monument stands in the main picnic area of the park in honor of the contributions made by these men in making the park a place for so many to enjoy.
Geography.
The park covers 820 acres and includes a small lake. It is located northeast of Woodward in a portion of Oklahoma known for a semi-arid climate and sparse vegetation. The park itself includes a forest of hackberry, walnut, soapberry (also called chinaberry), oak, and elm, attracting whitetail deer, wild turkey, raccoon, coyote, bobcat, beaver, badger, skunk, and opossum.
Northwestern Oklahoma includes three eco-regions known as the Sandstone Hills, Gypsum Hills and High Plains. Water rising rapidly to the surface from underground streams creates the appearance of "boiling" water on the springs.
Amenities.
The park offers cabins, RV sites and tent campsites. It has an 18-hole golf course and hiking trails. The park provides a variety of services and facilities for the enjoyment of more than 200,000 visitors each year. Two camping areas can accommodate everything from pup tents to modern recreational vehicles. Cabins are situated beside the park's 5-acre lake. Group camps, community building, and numerous picnic facilities are available here along with a host of other activities including hiking, camping, swimming, fishing, exercise walking and wildlife observation.
Fees.
To help fund a backlog of deferred maintenance and park improvements, the state implemented an entrance fee for this park and 21 others effective June 15, 2020. The fees, charged per vehicle, start at $10 per day for a single-day or $8 for residents with an Oklahoma license plate or Oklahoma tribal plate. Fees are waived for honorably discharged veterans and Oklahoma residents age 62 &amp; older and their spouses. Passes good for three days or a week are also available; annual passes good at all 22 state parks charging fees are offered at a cost of $75 for out-of-state visitors or $60 for Oklahoma residents. The 22 parks are:

This union allowed Benfica to participate in the 2001–02 first division. In their debut, Benfica were runners-up, losing 3–2 to Miramar Futsal Clube with the decisive goal coming from a future Benfica glory, André Lima. Benfica's notable players in their first season were Portuguese internationals Naná, Vitinho I, Drula and Nelito, who were coached by Alípio Matos.
The following season, with new players such as André Lima, Rogério Vilela, Pedro Costa and Arnaldo Pereira, Benfica won their first league title, against Sporting CP, their first Taça de Portugal, and their first SuperTaça.
In 2003–04, notable players Ciço and Ricardinho joined Benfica. Benfica reached the 2003–04 UEFA Futsal Cup final, losing 7–5 on aggregate to Interviu.

André Lima years (2008–2010).
In July 2008, despite being in charge only for four months, Benfica replaced Beto Aranha with former player and coach, André Lima. The only reinforcement was Pedrinho, while Miguel Almeida left. Benfica lost the Super Cup but won the Portuguese Cup, and the third league title in a row for the first time.

2010–present.
In the 2010–11 season, coach Paulo Fernandes, who had just won the league for Sporting, replaced European champion André Lima. Ricardinho left and was replaced by Diece. Another addition was Diego Sol who arrived from Belenenses, and Teka from Sporting. In this season Benfica lost the Portuguese Cup, and then the league in three matches, despite winning the regular phase. In European competitions, Benfica finished fourth in the 2010–11 UEFA Futsal Cup.
In 2011–12, Benfica added Marcão, Dentinho and Bruno Coelho. The season was better than the previous one as Benfica won all three competitions they entered: the Super Cup, Portuguese Cup and the league. Ricardinho returned in January on a 6 month-loan but failed to make an impact, being suspended for three matches in the final.
In 2012–13, Benfica hired Vítor Hugo
and Nené. On 2 September 2012, they won their sixth Super Cup against Modicus (5–3) and tied with Sporting in terms of overall titles (17). After a series of bad results, including an early exit of the UEFA Futsal Cup, Paulo Fernandes was sacked and replaced by João Freitas Pinto. However, Benfica failed to retain the league title, losing 3–1 in the final against Sporting. In the offseason, Benfica did not renew the contract of Davi, Diego Sol, Diece, Marinho and César Paulo, replacing them with Ricardo Fernandes, Pablo del Moral, Rafael Henmi, Serginho, Bruno Pinto, Paulinho, Alan Brandi and Ivo Oliveira.

WSBA (AM)

WSBA (910 kHz, "NewsTalk 93.9 &amp; 910 WSBA") is a commercial AM radio station licensed to York, Pennsylvania. The station is owned by Cumulus Media, through licensee Radio License Holding SRC, LLC. It broadcasts a news-talk radio format. The studios are on Susquehanna Plaza Drive near U.S. Route 30.
During the day, WSBA is powered at 5,000 watts. At night, however, to protect other stations on 910 AM from interference, WSBA reduces power to 1,000 watts. It uses a directional antenna with a four-tower array at all times. The transmitter is on Susquehanna Trail in York. The towers are at elevation with a height of . Their tops are above sea level. Programming is also heard on 250-watt FM translator W230CQ at 93.9 MHz. It is also simulcast on the HD Radio subchannel of sister station 96.1 WSOX-HD2.
Programming.
Most of the weekday schedule is nationally syndicated conservative talk shows, including Michael DelGiorno, Brian Kilmeade, Dan Bongino, Ben Shapiro, Michael Knowles, Matt Walsh, Mark Levin, Dave Ramsey, "Red Eye Radio" and "America in the Morning". Most hours begin with world and national news from Fox News Radio.
Weekends feature shows on money, health, gardening, technology, home improvement and the outdoors. Syndicated weekend programs include "The Kim Komando Show, In the House with Jason Chaffetz, The Brett Baier Show, The Chris Plante Show, America at Night with Rick Valdes" and "The Money Pit Home Improvement Radio Show". WSBA also carries Baltimore Orioles baseball games and Baltimore Ravens football games.
History.
Waiting for sign-on.
On July 24, 1942, an article in the "Gazette and Daily" discussed a new radio station, saying it would go on air in York sometime in the late summer. Otis Morse would be the Program Director and Willis Weaver would be the chief engineer.
In August, the "Gazette and Daily" ran an advertisement that stated "On the air soon - 900 the mid-point on your dial." A September announcement came in The Gazette and Daily on August 31, 1942. The September 1, 1942, Gazette and Daily Page 2 article announced, 'WSBA On the Air Today'.
First day.
The station signed on the air with a prayer by the Reverend Paul E. V. Shannon of the first United Brethren Church. York Mayor Harry B. Anstine read his Heroes Day proclamation. Much of the programming reflected that the nation was nearing the end of the first year of World War II.
The station had a 240-foot antenna and a 1,000 watt transmitter. An advertisement on page 3 that day called WSBA "York's own radio station."
Nearby, 580 WHP in Harrisburg went on the air in 1925, predating WSBA by 17 years. WLXW (now WHYL) in Carlisle went on the air in 1948, six years after WSBA and WGET in Gettysburg first aired August 27, 1950. WHVR AM in Hanover went into operation on January 7, 1949, on 1280 kHz with a power of 1000 watts.
Other stations in York in the 1950-1970 period included WORK and WNOW-FM and WNOW (AM) which was mainly country.
Moving to AM 910.
WSBA moved from 900 to 910 kHz on October 21, 1949. It still continued to be listed in radio listings as the old frequency 900 kHz through the middle of the 50s when the Gazette and Daily discontinued the radio listings.
The move allowed WSBA to increase its daytime power to 5,000 watts. WSBA's move to 910 is discussed in more detail in the publication "Susquehanna First 50 Years" by Phillip K. Eberly.
Full-service MOR.
During the 1950-1980 period, WSBA carried a full service, middle of the road (MOR) format of popular music, news, and sports. Ed Wickenheiser was one of the newscasters in the earliest reporting of the "Three Mile Island accident" in 1979 and is cited in the book TMI by investigative reporter Mark Lane.
During Hurricanes Agnes and Eloise, snowstorms, and other weather events, WSBA had frequent updates and information. When disasters hit, regular programming stopped. During the late 50s and early 60s, the station did a rundown of that week's Top 40 Hits on Saturday afternoons.
Ralph Lockwood was a long term morning host during that period and had a fictional sidekick Luscious Laverne. Ed Lincoln was another personality at that time who had a feature, the hit of the week, which was played every night on his program. The feature was available in Sol Kessler's Hi Fi Shop for $.59 during that week.
WSBA-FM.
WSBA management decided to add an FM station. On November 21, 1947, manager Otis Morse IV spoke to the York Exchange Club about frequency modulation (FM) radio. WSBA-FM first appears in a programming guide on February 28, 1949, in the "Hanover Sun". The station was on the air at 103.3 MHz.
A seminar was presented featuring Otis Morse from WSBA, with others from WNOW-AM, WORK-AM, and WRZE-FM 98.3 (per radio listing "The Evening Sun" May 12, 1953) participating.
During the 1960s and 1970s, WSBA was a leading top 40 music station in the Harrisburg-York-Lancaster area. It was also the flagship station of Susquehanna Radio's top 40 stations (which also included WHLO, WARM, and WICE).
Cumulus ownership.
On October 31, 2005, Cumulus Media announced the creation of a new private partnership, Cumulus Media Partners, LLC, formed with Bain Capital, The Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, to purchase Susquehanna Radio Corporation for approximately $1.2 billion. The purchase was completed on May 5, 2006.
At that time, the license for WSBA was transferred to Radio License Holding SRC, LLC., a division of Cumulus Media Partners Susquehanna Corporation.
On July 20, 2017, translator W253AC (now W230CQ), licensed to York, began simulcasting WSBA programming.

Michael Roes is a novelist, poet, anthropologist and film-maker with an interest in interaction with the foreign. He has drawn inspiration from a wide and diverse range of cultures in his work, from the North American Indians, featured in the novel "Der Coup der Berdache", to contemporary China in "Die Fünf Farben Schwarz", and from Welsh mythology in "Lleu Llaw Gyffes", to the Islamic world in "Leeres Viertel", "Weg nach Timimoun", "Nah Inverness", and "Geschichte der Freundschaft". His work is characterised by syncretism, experimentation and a multicultural flavour. It reveals a desire to engage with people from other cultures, and he has a vision of intercultural learning as an active exchange, an experience that must be sought, in which one must give as well as take.
"Leeres Viertel" published in 1996, was the novel that earned Roes his reputation as one of the leading German "Poeten des Fremden". In this novel the protagonist is an anthropologist travelling in Yemen researching traditional children's games. His account is a juxtaposition of travel writing, observations on daily life, anthropological lists, and reflections on the theory of play. Another complementary narrative strand in the novel comprises a diary written by an early nineteenth-century traveller to Yemen, Ferdinand Schnittke. Sharing a sensitivity to local customs, an interest in the traditions of the Arab world, and a similar fate, the two diary accounts closely intertwine.
"Nah Inverness", published in 2004, likewise features two diary accounts. One is by Hal Dumblatt, an American director hell-bent on filming a production of Macbeth in the Yemeni hinterlands, using Yemeni tribesmen as actors. The second narrative strand is provided by Ahmed, a Yemeni officer appointed to report on the film crew's activities. The novel's plot is based on real events: Michael Roes took a small film crew to Yemen in 2000 to film a version of Macbeth, entitled "Someone is Sleeping in my Pain: Ein west-östlicher Macbeth" (2001). This daring project can only be viewed as the epitome of the experimentation, and an eagerness to approach the unknown, that is inherent in Roes' work as a whole. Of all Roes' works the novel is, however, the least optimistic about the possibilities of making a successful and meaningful connection with people from different cultures.
In his most recent novel, "Geschichte der Freundschaft", published 2010, Roes returns to this theme with a novel that tells the story of a friendship between a German tourist and an Algerian student. – In all these novels intercultural encounters are portrayed as being complex and fragile. Relationships and friendships between people of vastly different backgrounds induce personal growth, deeper cultural understanding and involve a questioning of one's own cultural prejudices.
An idea fundamental to Roes' thinking on the topic of interculturality is the concept that that which unites the human race is much greater than that which divides it. No matter where on earth he or she may live, every human being has one thing in common – a physical body. Language and culture may keep people apart, but the experience of physical sensation forms a bond that is deeper than the superficial factors which separate the human race.
Theatre and Film.
Michael Roes took part in theatre and film work with adolescents in Berlin. He worked as Director's assistant at "Schaubühne Berlin" (1987–1989) and at "Munich Kammerspiele" (1989).
His first feature film "Someone is Sleeping in My Pain", a contemporary version of Shakespeare's "Macbeth", was shot in New York and Yemen with tribal warriors (2000–2001).
In 2003/2004 Roes made the documentary film "City of Happiness" about the present situation of young men in Algeria.
He also made the feature film "Timimoun", an Algerian road movie, based on the Greek tragedy of Orestes (2004/2005).
This road movie and the novel "Weg nach Timimoun" by Michael Roes are based on the Ancient Greek myth of Orestes who returned to Mycenae together with his friend Pylades to kill his mother and her lover in revenge of their murder of his father. Laid owns a small photo studio in the Algerian harbour city of Bejaia. In a letter his sister appeals to him to avenge his father who was shot by Laid’s mother in an act of desperation. Together with his friend Nadir young Laid reluctantly embarks on a trip to his hometown Timimoun, the legendary oasis in the Sahara desert.
The film and novel are a kind of anthropological journey full of danger and adventure through a country torn with political tension and under the growing influence of religious fundamentalism. In strong and vivid language Roes paints a picture of a society with violent fathers and hard-hearted mothers, but also with tenderful friendships.
Main subject of Roes' poetical and academic work is the role of the "stranger" or the "foreigner" in our societies. Specially the European view to the Arab world is one of the main topics in his major novels and recent films. His wide talent as a poet, novelist, play writer, essayist and film maker and his interest in outsiders puts him into the tradition of Jean Cocteau, Pier Paolo Pasolini or Bruce Chatwin.

Kentucky Route 1927

Kentucky Route 1927 (KY 1927) is a east–west state highway located in and around the cities of Lexington and Winchester, Kentucky. The western terminus of the route is at Kentucky Route 4 (East New Circle Road) east of downtown Lexington. The eastern terminus is at Kentucky Route 627 in downtown Winchester. KY 1927, along with U.S. Route 60 and Interstate 64 to the north, is one of three routes directly connecting Lexington to Winchester. In rural western Clark and eastern Fayette this road is considered one of the most dangerous because of its curves and trees. Many fatal accidents on this road has occurred more than any other major highway, road, or street in Winchester and Lexington.
The road is known by several names along its length, including Liberty Road, Todds Road, Colby Road, and Belmont Avenue.

Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin

The Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin () is an Old Irish prose tale of the ninth century or later. It forms part of the Cycles of the Kings.
It deals with the exile and return of Cano mac Gartnáin in sixth century Scotland. The tale involves historical figures such as Cano himself; Gartnán or Gartnait his father; Áedán mac Gabráin, the king of Dal Riada; Diarmait and Blathmac, sons of Áed Sláine; Guaire Aidne of the Uí Fiachrach, the king of Connacht and father of Cano's true love Créd.
The Irish annals contain a number of entries which may suggest that there is a kernel of truth behind the literary invention in the surviving tale, although Cano Garb mac Gartnáin, Guaire Aidne and the sons of Áed Sláine flourished more than half a century after Áedán mac Gabráin.

Stewart Baker

Stewart Abercrombie Baker (born July 17, 1947) was the first Assistant Secretary (acting as Under Secretary-equivalent) for Policy at the United States Department of Homeland Security under the Presidency of George W. Bush.
Baker is the former General Counsel of the National Security Agency (1992–1994) and author of the book, "The Limits of Trust: Cryptography, Governments, and Electronic Commerce" (1998), and other publications and articles on electronic commerce and international trade. Earlier in his career, Baker was law clerk to John Paul Stevens, Supreme Court from 1977 to 1978. He also clerked for Frank M. Coffin, United States Court of Appeals, First Circuit (1976–1977) and Shirley Hufstedler, US Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit (1975). He was in private practice with the Washington, DC–based law firm Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP from 1981 to 1992 and again from 1994 to 2005.
Early life.
Baker was born on July 17, 1947, in Poughkeepsie, New York. He is the son of Henry Irving Baker Jr. (1917–1949) and Ruth (Abercrombie) Baker (1918–1965). Baker's father died when he was young, and his mother eventually moved the family to Dearborn, Michigan, supporting them through a career with the Ford Motor Company. Baker attended public high school in Dearborn.
Baker obtained his B.A. degree from Brown University in 1969. He received his J.D. degree from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Law in 1975. While in law school, he published "A Strict Scrutiny of the Right to Travel" in the UCLA Law Review (1975). He also served as an intern law clerk to Shirley Hufstedler, U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.
Professional career.
Following his graduation from law school in 1976, Baker clerked for Frank M. Coffin, United States Court of Appeals, First Circuit. He then clerked for Justice Stevens of the Supreme Court from 1977 to 1978. In 1979, Baker became Deputy General Counsel, Special Assistant to Secretary Shirley Hufstedler, United States Department of Education. He served in this position until 1981. In 1981, Baker joined Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP.
Baker stayed with Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP until appointed in 1992 by President George H. W. Bush to serve as General Counsel to the National Security Agency (NSA). Baker served at the NSA during the time when the agency was defending the controversial Clipper Chip, an electronic encryption device that was equipped with a decoding key for use by the US government. Baker was awarded the Defense Medal for Meritorious Civilian Service in 1994.
Following his two-year stint at the National Security Agency, Baker returned to private practice at Steptoe &amp; Johnson. His practice at the firm concentrated on issues related to privacy, national security, computer security, electronic surveillance, encryption, digital commerce, and export controls.
As a Supreme Court advocate, Baker founded the State and Local Legal Center, and later successfully urged that the Court adopt innovative approaches to constitutional federalism ("New York v. United States (1992)") and the intersection of trademark and copyright ("Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox" (2003)). The Court also took note of Baker's "able representation" after appointing him to defend the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in "Becker v. Montgomery" (2001). See n. 1.
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, in 2003, Baker testified before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. His testimony noted:
Baker advocated for better use of modern technology for tracking terrorists, including the use of electronic surveillance and better coordination with law enforcement officials. He also noted the importance of recognizing and protecting privacy and civil liberties.
In 2004 to 2005, Baker chaired the drafting team for the report by the General Counsel of the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction. This report examined the intelligence around weapons of mass destruction prior to the invasion of Iraq and made specific recommendations for change to prevent future intelligence errors.
On July 13, 2005, Baker was appointed by President George W. Bush to be Assistant Secretary (acting as Under Secretary-equivalent) for Policy for the United States Department of Homeland Security. His nomination was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on October 7, 2005. News of his nomination was greeted with mixed reviews by privacy advocates and those concerned about his position on civil liberties; and the Department has been unable to elevate his position to an Under Secretary level. He negotiated several agreements between DHS and European governments concerning European privacy law and a U.S. legal requirement that airlines provide reservation data about US-bound passengers to the US government (Passenger name records or PNRs). One of these agreements had a "side letter" that abrogated significant parts of the published agreement.
In 2009, Baker returned to Steptoe &amp; Johnson, where he currently practices law (and holds the record for returning to the firm more times than any other lawyer). In 2013, he began hosting the Cyberlaw Podcast; this podcast is hosted by Reason Magazine, to whose law blog Baker also contributes.
Baker has collaborated to Project 2025; he is thanked for his contribution.

Da Adventures of Pedro Penduko

Komiks Presents: Da Adventures of Pedro Penduko () is a Philippine television drama fantasy series broadcast by ABS-CBN. The series is the first installment of "Komiks". Directed by Wenn V. Deramas, Trina N. Dayrit, Erick C. Salud, Dondon S. Santos, Jerome C. Pobocan, it stars Matt Evans in this role. It aired on the network's Saturday evening line up from September 9, 2006 to April 28, 2007, and was replaced by "Pedro Penduko at ang Mga Engkantao".
Unlike the stories in the first two seasons of "Komiks", which were mostly presented in a single episode or at most in two episodes, "Da Adventures of Pedro Penduko" will span the entire third (and fourth) season of the series.
The "Komiks" TV series version.
In "Komiks: Da Adventures of Pedro Penduko", the ABS-CBN network re-introduces the stories of Pedro, with Matt Evans of "Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition" fame in the title role. Also in the cast are Albert Martinez, Agot Isidro, Melissa Ricks, Bembol Roco, TJ Trinidad, comedian Kitkat, Deejay Durano, Olyn Membian and Gloria Romero. The small screen story stays true to the original, but is given a new and more sophisticated look.
Plot.
The Missing Father.
Pedro remains a simple boy thrust into the world of superstition and mythical creatures. The oft-taunted klutz of his class embarks on a special voyage accompanied by his special ‘helpers’, and finds his self-confidence increasing as he passes each challenge in his quest to save his father. In order to do this, he has to have the power of the "mutya ng saging" and has now entered Floreshka to save his father. But as Pedro Penduko sets off on his mission, his introduction to the monsters begins when he faces off with Philippine mythology’s scariest creatures. The conflict arises when Hiyas, who is in love and has a secret relationship with the mortal Pedro, finds out that her father, Haring Haddi of Floreshka, has entered into a peace treaty which states that there will only be peace and unity between the Floreshklans and Dalaketnons if Hiyas marries Napoleon. Hiyas refuses to comply as she is very much in love with Pedro. She also hates Napoleon because of his attitude, although the latter promises to change for the better if only Hiyas would fall in love with him.
Pedro's Underwater Adventure.
Pedro's newest adventure begins as Bukang Liwayway gets catapulted underwater by a large wave, at the most opportune moment for Pedro to know that she is his mother. That marks a new journey for our lovable hero, as he is determined to rescue Bukang Liwayway in the underwater world of Kalalawdan. As Pedro and his father Juan search for answers, they encounter some interesting twists along the way. It turns out that their dear friend Kadyo, whom they perceived to be dead, is actually alive, and is living with his family in Kalalawdan. Also, Pedro discovers the person behind all his trials, as wedding bells herald the future of Hiyas and Napoleon back in the Kingdom of Floreshka. When Pedro and Juan arrived at the underwater kingdom of Kalalawdan, they faced the different kind of underwater engkantos, which was led by Haring Bacul, the king of Kalalwdan, and Budlis, a Kataw soldier. Princess Kafra, though she knew that Pedro was an enemy, still fell in love with him. She wanted Pedro to be a Kataw like one of them, but Pedro insisted. Kafra could not do anything but let her heart be broken. She and her family then helped the Penduko family escape from Pantas and King Bacul. When Pedro was leaving, Kafra kissed him, and Hiyas saw it through his father's mirror. This happening made Hiyas agree to get married with Napoleon.
Fight For Love.
Just right when they came back from Kalalawdan, Pantas takes on a revenge on the Penduko family. Pantas stabs Juan, who later died. In return, Pedro made Pantas swallow the last stone of his mutya, that made him explode to death. Pedro, then decided to go to Floreshka to see Hiyas agrees to get married with Napoleon in order to save her life and her soul from the curse of the black mutya. On the other hand, Haddi and Kasimiro plans on taking Hiyas and Napoleon to " Tarusay", where they can be alone and learn to love each other. Not knowing by anyone, Kasimiro and Isidra are planning something on the day of Hiyas and Napoleon's wedding. Pedro, however, tries to stop the wedding by going to "Tarusay". Haddi, therefore decided to make the wedding earlier and asked both the Floreshkan and Dalaketnon armies to capture Pedro and put him in jail, so the wedding will not be resumed. Maalindog and Marikit heard the conversation of Kasimiro and Isidra, but they got caught. Maalindog turned into a sunflower by Isidra, while Marikit escaped and helped Pedro get out of the jail and tells Haddi about Kasimiro and Isidra's plan on capturing Floreshka. In the beginning of the wedding, Kasimiro decided to leave and let Isidra takes care of the wedding. In the middle of the ceremony, Isidra was about to attack Hiyas, but Haddi got in the way protecting her daughter, leading to his death. The Floreshkans fought back to the Dalaketnons, and turned into a war. A revelation was later revealed when Juan (who died earlier in the story) returns, but not as a human, as a Floreshkan. Pedro was shocked when he saw his father, but Bukang Liwayway explained that she and Haddi went into an agreement that Juan's body will be killed but his soul will be alive and be a Floreshkan. As the war goes on, Isidra is killed by Napoleon using the punyal, Pedro and Hiyas goes back to Tulay-buhangin and there they faced the different creatures that Pedro once fought. Suddenly, Kasimiro appears and attacks Pedro and Hiyas, but Bukang Liwayway, Juan and Napoleon comes in. Also they got attack by Kasimiro. Pedro then stabs Kasimiro using the punyal, that Napoleon used to kill Isidra, and dies. In the end, the Dalaketnons lost, Napoleon went to the Floreshkans, and Bukang Liwayway became the queen of Floreshka. Being the queen, Bukang Liwayway abolished the rule that an encantada/encantado cannot fall in love with a human. In his return, Pedro graduated high school and decides to live as a normal person. Hiyas, on the other hand, asked Bukang Liwayway if she could be a human and live with Pedro in Manila, where he would study college. But at the end Pedro hears an old man calling for him...

Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital

The Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital, also known as Kirkbride's Hospital or the Pennsylvania Hospital for Mental and Nervous Diseases, was a psychiatric hospital located at 48th and Haverford Streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. It operated from its founding in 1841 until 1997. The remaining building, now called the Kirkbride Center is now part of the Blackwell Human Services Campus.
Two large hospital structures and an elaborate pleasure ground were built on a campus that stretched along the north side of Market Street, from 45th to 49th Streets. Thomas Story Kirkbride, the hospital's first superintendent and physician-in-chief, developed a more humane method of treatment for the mentally ill there, that became widely influential. The hospital's plan became a prototype for a generation of institutions for the treatment of the mentally ill nationwide. The surviving 1859 building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.
History.
19th century.
In the late 1830s, the managers of Pennsylvania Hospital began erecting a large asylum to replace the hospital's crowded insane wards at 8th and Spruce Streets. The site chosen was a former farm in the as-yet unincorporated district of West Philadelphia. The first structure for the Pennsylvania Asylum for the Insane was designed by Isaac Holden and was located near what is now 46th and Market Streets. Completed in 1841, the facility offered comforts and a "humane treatment" philosophy that set a standard for its day. Unlike other asylums where patients were often kept chained in crowded, unsanitary wards with little if any treatment, patients at the Pennsylvania Asylum resided in private rooms, received medical treatment, worked outdoors and enjoyed recreational activities including lectures and a use of the hospital library. The facility came to be called "Kirkbride's Hospital."
Superintendent Thomas Kirkbride developed his treatment philosophy based on research he conducted at other progressive asylums of the day, including the one in Worcester, as well as his deep-seated personal opinions regarding mental health and his experience at the Pennsylvania Asylum. Out of his philosophy emerged the Kirkbride Plan, which created a model design for psychiatric hospital buildings that was used across the United States throughout the 19th century. He described his system in great detail in his influential work, "On the Construction, Organization, and General Arrangements of Hospitals for the Insane with Some Remarks on Insanity and Its Treatment" (1854).
Overcrowding had become a problem in the original Pennsylvania Asylum for the Insane by the 1850s, so Kirkbride lobbied the Pennsylvania Hospital managers for an additional building. The situation offered him a unique opportunity to place his standardized concepts for mental hospital design and construction into effect at a facility under his control. The Pennsylvania Hospital's Department for Males building was soon constructed along 49th Street, a short distance west from the original asylum. Completed in 1859, this huge structure consisted of several wings extending from a main central building. It introduced many innovations in terms of spaciousness, airiness and light, that were subsequently widely reproduced in other facilities. Young architect Samuel Sloan, Kirkbride's friend and collaborator, designed the Neoclassical style building.
20th century.
Mental health services at the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital continued to expand throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. But by the mid-20th century, the 1841 hospital building proved unusable for this purpose and was demolished in 1959. All treatment moved to the Department for Males building in 1959. That structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a National Historic Landmark on October 15, 1966.
The institute was located in what is now the Mill Creek neighborhood of Philadelphia. It continued operations until 1997 when, in the face of shrinking revenues from insurance providers, Pennsylvania Hospital sold the property and moved its mental health services back to the main hospital campus at 8th and Spruce Streets. Three tall housing projects and a multi-purpose social-service facility were built near the site of the 1841 hospital. Other parts of the property were sold for commercial and residential development in 2001.
21st century.
The remaining Department for Males building is now the Kirkbride Center, a part of the Blackwell Human Services Campus. It houses the West Philadelphia ACES Charter School, Pennsylvania Hospital's Mill Creek School, Philadelphia Health Management Corporation's Adolescent Residential Treatment Center, and a Traveler's Aid's emergency family shelter.

Virginia State Route 47

State Route 47 (SR 47) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and US 58 Business in South Hill north to US 460 Business in Pamplin City, Virginia. SR 47 passes through Southside Virginia, where the highway connects the towns of Chase City in Mecklenburg County and Drakes Branch and Charlotte Court House in Charlotte County.
The entire length of SR 47 is a Virginia Byway.
Route description.
SR 47 begins at the intersection of Mecklenburg Avenue and Atlantic Street in the center of South Hill. Mecklenburg Avenue heads north as US 1 and south as US 1 and US 58 Business. US 58 Business also heads east on Atlantic Street. SR 47 heads west as Atlantic Street to the western town limit of South Hill. The state highway passes through several small communities, including North View, Wightman, and Drapersville, as it traverses northern Mecklenburg County on top of the drainage divide between the Meherrin River to the north and the Roanoke River to the south. SR 47 enters the town of Chase City as Second Street. In the center of town, Second Street intersects Main Street. Second Street continues west as SR 49 and SR 92. SR 92 heads south on Main Street, while SR 47 turns north and runs concurrently with SR 49 to the north town limit. There, SR 49 continues north toward Victoria while SR 47 turns northwest, again closely following the drainage divide.
SR 47 continues into Charlotte County as Craftons Gate Highway, named for the hamlet where the state highway intersects US 15 and US 360 (Kings Highway). The highway continues north and serves as Main Street in the town of Drakes Branch, where the highway crosses Twittys Creek and meets the western end of SR 59 (Gethsemane Church Avenue). SR 47 leaves the town as Tollhouse Highway and crosses Roanoke Creek before reaching Charlotte Court House. The state highway enters the county seat as Lagrande Avenue and has a very short concurrency with SR 40, which follows David Bruce Avenue to the west and George Washington Highway to the east. SR 47 exits Charlotte Court House as Thomas Jefferson Highway. The highway crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway's Altavista District rail line at the hamlet of Cullen. At County Line Road, SR 47 begins to follow the boundary between Charlotte and Prince Edward counties. The state highway has brief stretches entirely within one of the counties before continuing to serve as the county line as the highway closely parallels Norfolk Southern's Blue Ridge District. SR 47's path along the county line ends when the highway enters Appomattox County just south of the town of Pamplin City, where the Blue Ridge District merges with the Farmville Belt Line coming from the east. The state highway passes under the two railroad tracks just before reaching its northern terminus at US 460 Business. US 460 Business connects with US 460, which heads east toward Farmville and west toward Appomattox.

Memory module

In computing, a memory module or RAM stick is a printed circuit board on which memory integrated circuits are mounted. 
Memory modules permit easy installation and replacement in electronic systems, especially computers such as personal computers, workstations, and servers. The first memory modules were proprietary designs that were specific to a model of computer from a specific manufacturer. Later, memory modules were standardized by organizations such as JEDEC and could be used in any system designed to use them.
Distinguishing characteristics of computer memory modules include voltage, capacity, speed (i.e., bit rate), and form factor.
Overview.
Types of memory module include:
The large memories found in personal computers, workstations, and non-handheld game-consoles normally consist of dynamic RAM (DRAM). Other parts of the computer, such as cache memories normally use static RAM. Small amounts of SRAM are sometimes used in the same package as DRAM. However, since SRAM has high leakage power and low density, die-stacked DRAM has recently been used for designing multi-megabyte sized processor caches.
Physically, most DRAM is packaged in black epoxy resin.
General DRAM formats.
Dynamic random access memory is produced as integrated circuits (ICs) bonded and mounted into plastic packages with metal pins for connection to control signals and buses. In early use individual DRAM ICs were usually either installed directly to the motherboard or on ISA expansion cards; later they were assembled into multi-chip plug-in modules (DIMMs, SIMMs, etc.). Some standard module types are:
Common DRAM modules.
Common DRAM packages as illustrated to the right, from top to bottom (last three types are not present in the group picture, and the last type is available in a separate picture), this list is in roughly chronological order:

3671 Dionysus

3671 Dionysus is a small binary Amor asteroid, orbiting between Earth and the asteroid belt. It was discovered by Carolyn and Gene Shoemaker at Palomar Observatory on 27 May 1984. It is named after Dionysus, the Greek god of wine. Its provisional designation was 1984 KD. It is an outer Earth grazer because its perihelion is just within Earth's orbit.
Potentially hazardous object.
3671 Dionysus is a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) because its minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) is less than 0.05 AU and its diameter is greater than 150 meters. The Earth-MOID is . Its orbit is well-determined for the next several hundred years.
Dionysus makes modestly close approaches to Earth. On 19 June 1984 Dionysus passed from Earth. On 18 June 2085 it will pass from Earth.
Moon.
In 1997, a team of astronomers at the European Southern Observatory announced that lightcurve observations indicate the presence of a small moon orbiting Dionysus. Its provisional designation is S/1997 (3671) 1. This moon measures 300 meters in diameter, and orbits 3.6 km from Dionysus with an eccentricity of 0.07 and an orbital period of 27.72 hours. From the surface of Dionysus, S/1997 (3671) 1 would have an apparent diameter of roughly 3.02 degrees. For comparison, the Sun appears to be 0.5° from Earth.

<doc id="7033366" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7033366" title="Paul Galvin (Gaelic footballer)">
Paul Galvin (Gaelic footballer)

Paul Galvin (born 2 November 1979) is an Irish sportsman. He plays Gaelic football with his local club Finuge, his divisional side Feale Rangers and, between 2003 and 2014, for the Kerry county team. Galvin had the honour of being named as the 1000th All Star Award. He also represented Ireland in the 2004 International Rules Series.
Galvin has written a weekly fashion column for the "Irish Independent" newspaper and presented a show on Radio Kerry.
He briefly managed the Wexford footballers but left the role amid the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gaelic games.
Playing career.
Club.
Born in Lixnaw, County Kerry, Galvin plays his club football with his local club Finuge and with his divisional side Feale Rangers. He also plays hurling with his local club Lixnaw.
In 2002 Galvin tasted victory for the first time as a footballer when Finuge qualified for the final of the county junior championship. The opponents on that occasion were Castlegregory. After two defeats at the same stage of the competition in 1998 and 2000, Galvin's side made no mistake at the third time of asking. A merited 0–12 to 1–6 victory gave Finuge the victory and gave Galvin a county junior winners' medal. Finuge subsequently represented Kerry in the provincial junior championship and even reached the final. Cork champions Kiskeam provided the opposition, however, the dream season continued for the Kerry men. Galvin added a Munster junior winners' medal to his collection following a 0–14 to 0–11 victory.
After surrendering their county title for a year, Finuge were back in the county junior final again in 2004. Lispole were the opponents this time around and a close game developed once again. Galvin's side nearly kicked the match away with an enormous wides tally, however, after a period of extra-time Finuge regained the title on a score line of 1–10 to 1–7. Another provincial decider beckoned for Galvin's side, with Cork champions Aghabullogue providing the opposition. The game was an exciting but one-sided affair, and Galvin picked up a second Munster junior winners' medal after a 2–13 to 3–4 victory. On this occasion the Kerry side went all the way to the All-Ireland final where Stewartstown Harps of Tyrone were waiting. Galvin gave an outstanding display in that game and the northerners were easily brushed aside on a score line of 1–14 to 0–6. This win gave Galvin an All-Ireland club winners' medal in the junior grade.
In 2007 Galvin lined out with divisional side Feale Rangers in the final of the county senior championship. A divisional side from the other half of the county, South Kerry provided the opposition. Furthermore, South Kerry were going for a remarkable fourth county title in succession. The game was an extremely close affair, however, Galvin's side pulled through to win by 1–5 to 0–6. With that he added a county senior winners' medal to his collection. It was Rangers' first county triumph in twenty-seven years.
Galvin is also a hurler of note and has enjoyed much success with Lixnaw. In 1999 he was a key member of the team that lined out against Crotta O'Neill's in the final of the county senior championship. After a 2–8 apiece draw, Lixnaw made no mistake in the replay and secured a narrow 0–9 to 1–5 victory. It was his first senior winners' medal in hurling.
After back-to-back county final defeats in 2002 and 2003, Lixnaw were back in 2005 and faced Abbeydorney. A third defeat in four years looked extremely likely, however, Galvin was the hero of the day. In the second minute of injury-time he sent over the equalising point and secured a 1–11 to 2–8 draw and a second chance in the replay. Lixnaw made no mistake on the second occasion and blew the opposition off the pitch. An enormous 0–17 to 0–6 victory gave Galvin a second county winners' medal.
After surrendering the hurling title the following year, Lixnaw were back to reclaim it in 2007. Kilmoyley provided the opposition in another final as Galvin's side went into the game as underdogs. The form book was torn up as Lixnaw powered to a 1–12 to 2–6 victory and a third county winners' medal for Galvin.
On 21 January 2011, media reports suggested that Galvin was poised for a club transfer from Finuge to St Vincent's in Dublin, but his club team-mate and former member of the Kerry management team, Éamonn Fitzmaurice, rubbished those reports via Twitter.
Minor and under-21.
Galvin first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kerry minor football team in the late 1990s. He lined out in his only provincial decider in that grade in 1997 with Limerick providing the opposition. The game was a huge triumph for 'the Kingdom' as Galvin's side won by 4–12 to 1–7. It was his first Munster winners' medal at minor level. Kerry were later defeated in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. The same year he won an All-Ireland Vocational Schools Championship with the Kerry Vocational Schools team following victory over Tyrone in the final.
Galvin's performances at minor level made him an automatic choice for the Kerry under-21 team in 1999. The provincial decider that year pitted Kerry against archrivals Cork. A close game developed, however, after the sixty minutes Kerry were the champions by 1–10 to 0–7. It was Galvin's only Munster under-21 winners' medal. An All-Ireland final appearance followed for Galvin, with Westmeath providing the opposition. Kerry were the favourites going into the game, however, the Leinster minnows proved that they were no pushovers. A narrow 0–12 to 0–9 score line resulted in defeat for Galvin's side.
Galvin continued to play for the Kerry under-21 team for another two seasons, however, he enjoyed little further success.
Senior.
Galvin first played at intercounty senior level for Kerry not with the footballers but the hurlers in the late 90s. He made a number of appearances with the team during the NHL during this time.
Galvin joined the Kerry senior football team in the early 2000s, however, he had to wait for a number of years before establishing himself on the starting fifteen. In 2003 he renewed his rivalry with Limerick when he came on as a substitute in the provincial decider. A 1–11 to 0–9 victory gave Galvin a first Munster winners' medal in the senior grade. After an exciting game with Roscommon, Kerry advanced to an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Tyrone. After being shocked in the latter stages of the two previous championships, Kerry were out to atone and were favourites going into the match. The whole team struggled and Kerry looked like they were going to be left behind with the new "blanket defence" that was introduced by teams like Armagh and perfected by Tyrone. Many criticised this tactic as a means of stopping talented footballers like Ó Sé and Colm Cooper from playing but few could deny its effectiveness. A humiliating 0–13 to 0–6 defeat saw Tyrone advance to the All-Ireland final while Kerry were unceremoniously dumped out of the championship.
2004 saw Galvin become an integral part of the Kerry team. The year began well with Kerry reaching the final of the National League. An exciting 3–11 to 1–6 victory saw Kerry claim the title and Galvin picked up a first National Football League winners' medal. Kerry later booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and, for the second year in succession, Limerick were the opponents. Surprisingly, that game ended in a 1–10 apiece draw. The replay was also a close-run affair; however, Kerry never really looked in danger of losing. A 3–10 to 2–9 victory gave Galvin a second Munster winners' medal. The All-Ireland series proved no difficulty for Kerry, and 'the Kingdom' booked their place in the All-Ireland final against Mayo. An early goal from Alan Dillon gave the Connacht men some hope, however, the game was effectively over after twenty-five minutes when Colm Cooper scored Kerry's only goal of the day. The points kept coming from Galvin's team and an injury-time Michael Conroy goal was nothing but a consolation for Mayo. A 1–20 to 2–9 victory gave Galvin an All-Ireland winners' medal. Galvin was later presented with his first All-Star, the 1000th award since the scheme began in 1971.
In 2005 Kerry were hot favourites to retain their All-Ireland title. All was going to plan as Galvin's side reached yet another provincial final. In a return to tradition, Cork were the opponents. A close game developed, however, in the end Kerry were the narrow winners by 1–11 to 0–11. It was Galvin's third consecutive Munster winners' medal. Following this win Kerry cruised through the All-Ireland series to reach another championship decider with Tyrone providing the opposition. In one of the great finals of the decade, the result remained in doubt until the final whistle. Dara Ó Cinnéide powered Kerry ahead with a goal after just six minutes. Tyrone responded in kind with a Peter Canavan goal just before half-time. Tomás Ó Sé launched the Kerry comeback in the 57th minute with Kerry's second goal; however, it was too later. Tyrone hung on to win by 1–16 to 2–10. It was Galvin's first defeat in an All-Ireland final.
In 2006 Kerry reached the final of the National League and played Galway. Galvin's side could only manage three points in the opening half, however, the introduction of Eoin Brosnan transformed the team. At the end of the seventy minutes a 2–12 to 0–10 score line gave Kerry their 18th National League title and a second for Galvin. The league win was a false dawn as Kerry went out tamely to Cork in a replay of the Munster final. The team, however, bounced back against Longford to set up a meeting with Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter-final. At half-time it looked as though the Ulser hoodoo would strike again but Kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half and won by a score of 3–15 to 1–13. The game was not without incident as Galvin was red-carded for an altercation with the Armagh water carrier. Kerry again beat Cork in the subsequent semi-final before lining out against Mayo in the All-Ireland final. An unbelievable opening first-half saw Kerry go 2–4 to no score ahead after just ten minutes, courtesy of goals by Declan O'Sullivan and Kieran Donaghy. Colm Cooper slotted a third Kerry goal, however, Mayo settled and reduced the deficit to 3–8 to 3–2 at half-time. The second thirty-five minutes saw Kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points. A final score of 4–15 to 3–5 gave Kerry another All-Ireland title and gave Galvin a second All-Ireland winners' medal. Galvin finished off the year with a second All-Star award.
2007 saw Kerry face Cork in the provincial decider once again. A close game developed, however, at the full-time whistle Kerry were the champions by 1–15 to 1–13. It was Ó Galvin's fourth Munster winners' medal. Kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their All-Ireland quarter-final against Monaghan, setting up a glamour All-Ireland semi-final tie with Dublin. Kerry saw off a great Dublin comeback in the second half to win by two points. The subsequent All-Ireland final was an historic occasion as Kerry faced Cork in the very first all-Munster championship decider. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. Cork goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3–13 to 1–9. It was a third All-Ireland medal for Galvin and the first completion of back-to-back All-Ireland titles since Cork in 1989 and 1990.
In 2008 Galvin was appointed captain of the Kerry team. It was a great honour. What should have been a dream season for the Finuge man, particularly since Kerry were attempting to capture a first three-in-a-row of All-Ireland titles since 1986, 'the Kingdom's' championship opener against Clare was a dark moment for Galvin. The game was a largely low-key affair except for one controversial incident between referee Paddy Russell and Galvin. Russell was attempting to book the team captain when he slapped the notebook out of Russell's hand. Galvin then remonstrated with the linesman who had recommended his second yellow card. The incident has been described as due to the "frustration" he felt at being booked "for highlighting to the linesman the blatant and protracted pulling and dragging he was subjected to off the ball by his Clare marker". Galvin received a six-month suspension, however, this was later reduced to twelve weeks. It looked at this stage that Galvin's dream season was in tatters. Kerry drove on without him and reached the All-Ireland final for a fifth successive year. Conveniently, Galvin's suspension ended on the day of the championship decider against Tyrone. While he did not start the game he came on as a substitute. An exciting game developed, one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years. The sides were level seven times before Colm Cooper nudged Kerry 0–8 to 0–7 ahead before the interval. Tyrone simply wore Kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from Tommy McGuigan and a string of late points inspired Tyrone to their third All-Ireland title of the decade.
2009 saw Galvin return to the half-forward line for Kerry's opening Munster semi-final meeting with Cork. That game ended in a draw, however, Kerry were well beaten in the replay. 'The Kingdom' were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over Longford, Sligo and Antrim. Galvin and his squad later lined out in the All-Ireland quarter-final and thrashed Dublin before overcoming Meath in a disappointing semi-final. For the second year in-a-row Kerry faced Cork in the All-Ireland final. Surprisingly, the men from 'the Kingdom' went into the game as slight underdogs. This tag appeared to be justified when Galvin's side trailed by 1–3 to 0–1 early in the opening half. The Kerry team stuck to their gameplan while Cork recorded fourteen wides, and at the final whistle Kerry were the champions again by 0–16 to 1–9. It was Galvin's fourth All-Ireland medal. He subsequently won an All-Star and the Footballer of the Year award.
In June 2010, Galvin was given an eight-week ban after the 2010 Munster Senior Football Championship semi-final replay win over Cork.
The GAA's Central Competitions Control Committee proposed the suspension after reviewing video evidence of Galvin putting his finger into Eoin Cadogan's mouth.
On 1 February 2014, Galvin unexpectedly announced his retirement from inter county football in the aftermath of Kerry's opening round game of the 2014 National Football League.
Kerry had lost by one point to Dublin in a game in which Galvin had not been involved.
On 3 March 2015, Galvin returned to the Kerry senior football panel.
College.
Galvin played with UCC with whom he won Cork Senior Football Championship and Munster Senior Club Football Championship medals in 1999. He also played in the Sigerson Cup.

School.
Galvin won an All-Ireland Vocational Schools Championship with the Kerry Vocational Schools team in 1997.
Association football.
Galvin has in the past trained with Cork City of Munster and Sunderland of Tyne and Wear.
Managerial career.
On 2 August 2019, Wexford GAA announced Galvin as its senior football manager on a two-year term, succeeding Paul McLoughlin.
He left the role abruptly in September 2020 amid the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gaelic games, with the 2020 National Football League having been suspended since mid-March, meaning he did not manage for a full league campaign and for no championship game. Shane Roche, a member of Galvin's backroom team, replaced him.
Personal life.
Galvin was a secondary school teacher of Geography and Gaeilge in Coláiste Chríost Rí, Cork and St. Brendan's College, Killarney. He coached the senior school team to the All-Ireland in 2009.
In February 2012, he came third in a poll to find Ireland's most desirable Valentines.
In April 2013 it was reported he had been sued for €8,000 in damages for throwing a blackboard duster at one of his students.
Paul Galvin got engaged to Louise Duffy on a trip to New York in March 2014. They got married on New Year's Eve 2015.
Controversy.
In October 2011, Galvin allegedly assaulted the impressionist Oliver Callan and his producer James McDonald late at night in Kehoe's Pub, Central Dublin. Among witnesses to the alleged incident were a Government Minister, a TD, a senator and several journalists. One witness alleged Galvin called Callan a "Fucking Cunt". The incident was investigated by an Garda Síochána. The media speculated on the reason behind the alleged incident, reporting that Callan had recently mimicked Galvin asking Taoiseach Enda Kenny to man-up by giving him a body-wax on "Green Tea" and that Galvin had texted Callan before an appearance on "The Saturday Night Show" in relation to "gay jibes" the satirist had directed at him. It was eventually revealed that Galvin had complained (or not complained at all) to RTÉ after what he described as "the most excruciating night of my life" at home on his sofa between his parents in Kerry watching "The Saturday Night Show" when Callan referred to Galvin's "years spent in the closet".
On 6 December 2011, Galvin spoke of the encounter during an interview on "The Ray D'Arcy Show" on Today FM.

Italian battleship Dante Alighieri

Dante Alighieri was the first dreadnought battleship built for the "Regia Marina" (Royal Italian Navy) and was completed in 1913. The ship served as a flagship during World War I, but saw very little action other than the Second Battle of Durazzo in 1918 during which she did not engage enemy forces. She never fired her guns in anger during her career. "Dante Alighieri" was refitted in 1923, stricken from the Navy List five years later and subsequently sold for scrap.
Description.
"Dante Alighieri" was designed by Rear Admiral Engineer Edoardo Masdea, Chief Constructor of the "Regia Marina", based on the ideas of General Vittorio Cuniberti who advocated a battleship with main guns of a single caliber and optimized for broadside fire. In addition, the ship's superstructure and funnels were to be kept to a minimum.
The dreadnought was long at the waterline, and overall. The ship had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced at normal load, and at deep load. "Dante Alighieri" had two rudders, one behind the other, and a crew of 31 officers and 950 enlisted men.
The ship was propelled by four propeller shafts driven by Parsons steam turbines. Steam for the turbines was provided by 23 Blechynden water-tube boilers, seven of which burned oil and the remaining sixteen burned a mixture of oil and coal. The boilers were widely separated in two compartments, each with two funnels, and the turbines were positioned between the two center turrets. Designed to reach a maximum speed of from , "Dante Alighieri" failed to reach this goal on her sea trials, making a maximum speed of only from . The ship could store a maximum of of coal and an unknown quantity of fuel oil that gave her a range of at , and at .
"Dante Alighieri" had a complete waterline armor belt that had a maximum thickness of . The ship's armored deck was thick. The main turrets were protected by a maximum of 254 millimeters of armor while the secondary turrets and the casemates had of armor. The conning tower had walls 305 millimeters thick.
Armament.
"Dante Alighieri"s main armament consisted of a dozen 46-caliber 305-millimeter (12 inch) guns, in four triple-gun turrets positioned on the ship's centerline. None of the turrets were superfiring. While the later classes of battleships and battlecruisers designed for the Imperial Russian Navy shared the turret layout of the "Dante Alighieri", all surviving evidence shows that the Russians decided on this layout for their own reasons.
Sources disagree regarding these guns' performance, but naval historian Giorgio Giorgerini claims that they fired armor-piercing (AP) projectiles at the rate of one round per minute and that they had a muzzle velocity of which gave a maximum range of .
The ship's secondary armament consisted of twenty 50-caliber guns. Eight of these guns were fitted in twin-gun turrets abreast the forward and aft main gun turrets while the remaining 12 guns were mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull. These guns could depress to −10 degrees and had a maximum elevation of +15 degrees; they had a rate of fire of six shots per minute. They could fire a high-explosive projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum distance of . For defense against torpedo boats, "Dante Alighieri" carried thirteen 50-caliber guns mounted on the turret tops. These guns had the same range of elevation as the secondary guns, although their rate of fire was higher at 10 rounds per minute. They fired a AP projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum distance of . The ship was also fitted with three submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.
Construction and service.
"Dante Alighieri", named after the medieval Italian poet, was the only dreadnought battleship ever named for a poet. She was laid down at the naval shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia on 6 June 1909, launched on 20 August 1910, and completed on 15 January 1913. The ship was used to evaluate Curtiss floatplanes in 1913–14. When Italy entered World War I in May 1915, "Dante Alighieri" was the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron based at Taranto and remained with the squadron through 1916. For the rest of the war, the ship was assigned to the Southern Adriatic and Ionian Sea forces. Under the command of Vice Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the ship was positioned to intercept any Austro-Hungarian ships based at Cattaro if they sortied to attack the Allied ships bombarding Durazzo on 2 October 1918. The Austro-Hungarians remained in harbor and "Dante Alighieri" did not fire her guns during the battle.
King Victor Emmanuel III entertained delegates to the Genoa Conference aboard "Dante Alighieri" in 1922. The ship was refitted in 1923 with a tripod foremast and an aircraft flying-off platform on Turret No. 3, and her forward funnels were made taller to reduce smoke interference with the bridge. She tested a new fire-control system in 1924 at ranges up to ; her new tripod mast was not sturdy enough for the weight of the system, but it was judged to be successful and subsequently installed in the s. That same year, the ship transported Benito Mussolini to Palermo, Sicily. The Italian economy had been weakened by fighting in World War I, and by the late 1920s it could no longer afford to maintain a sizable fleet. As a result, Admiral Giovanni Sechi decided to scrap "Dante Alighieri" and the salvaged battleship to reduce the naval budget. The ship was stricken on 1 July 1928 and was subsequently scrapped.

Bosnia and Herzegovina men's national basketball team

The Bosnia and Herzegovina men's national basketball team (Bosnian: "Košarkaška reprezentacija Bosne i Hercegovine" / Кошаркашка репрезентација Босне и Херцеговине) represents Bosnia and Herzegovina in international basketball competitions, and is governed by the Basketball Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Until 1992, Bosnian basketballers played for Yugoslavia.
Bosnia and Herzegovina reached their first international tournament at the EuroBasket in 1993. They have competed ten times at the event overall. The team has yet to qualify on the global level to play at the FIBA World Cup.
History.
Until 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina was a part of Yugoslavia, which meant players born in Bosnia and Herzegovina played for the Yugoslavia national team. Between 1947 and 1992, the following Bosnia-born players were selected to play for the Yugoslavia national team at the biggest competitions (Olympics, World Cup, and EuroBasket) at least once: Mirza Delibašić, Dražen Dalipagić, Predrag Danilović, Zoran Savić, Ratko Radovanović, Borislav Stanković, Milan Bjegojević, Dragiša Vučinić, Sabit Hadžić, Emir Mutapčić, and Mario Primorac. During this time, Bosnia and Herzegovina's capital city, Sarajevo, was one of five locations where games were played during the 1970 FIBA World Cup; where Yugoslavia finished in first place, the team's first gold medal at the FIBA World Cup.
After gaining its independence from Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina qualified to the EuroBasket for the first time in 1993. Entering the tournament, Bosnia and Herzegovina earned their first ever EuroBasket victory in their final Group A match against Sweden. The team would go on to make it to the quarter-finals before losing to the eventual bronze medalists Croatia, which sent the team into the classification phase to finish out the competition.
After a positive showing for the national team in their first EuroBasket appearance, they would fail to qualify for the tournament in 1995. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina would turn around to qualify for the continental showpiece five consecutive times (1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005). Although after that stretch for the national team, they would only qualify for the Euros three times after 2005 until 2015. Heading toward qualification for EuroBasket 2017, Bosnia and Herzegovina came up short in their attempt to qualify to the EuroBasket for the first time since 2009.
For qualification to reach the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Bosnia and Herzegovina first went through European Pre-Qualifiers, where the team won four out of their six matches (4–2) to advance. Entering the first round of the qualifiers, the national team earned a tough win at home against Russia 81–76. After the win, Bosnia and Herzegovina would pull out one more victory during the rest of the first round of qualifying to position itself to advance. In the second and final round of 2019 World Cup qualifying, the team lost its first five matches by single digits before defeating Bulgaria. However, the five crucial losses ultimately eliminated the team from clinching qualification.
In 2022, Bosnia and Herzegovina were set to play in the EuroBasket 2022 but were in danger on missing out on the tournament due to a lack of funds, just weeks before the start. Eventually, the federation received 150,000 convertible marks in financial aid from the Bosnian government, to ensure participation in the tournament.

Career.
1970s: Early work and career beginnings.
Soriano started acting at the age of six in the 1971 film "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" with Tirso Cruz III and fellow child actress Snooky Serna. She was brought by her paternal grandmother to Sampaguita Pictures search for a child actress who will portray Tirso Cruz, III's younger sister. She had grabbed the role with her dancing, singing and acting skills. Soriano developed her comic skills under the guidance of the veteran comedians Dolphy and Nida Blanca, both of whom she considered second parents, especially when she grew up acting in "John en Marsha" where she was a regular cast.
1980s: Rise to prominence.
In 1980, Soriano was signed up by Regal Films and became part of the movie production company’s pioneering batch of contract stars who were collectively called "Regal Babies" along with Snooky Serna, Dina Bonnevie, Gabby Concepcion, Albert Martinez, Alfie Anido, Jimi Melendez and her loveteam partner, William Martinez. Aside from working in "John en Marsha", which spawned several movie spinoffs, and other Dolphy productions, Maricel starred in the youth-oriented TV program "Kaluskos Musmos", which started airing in 1984. She was eventually introduced in the coming-of-age movie, "Underage" (1980). In their first film together, Oh, My Mama!, Soriano and Martinez showed great chemistry and became a love team on and offscreen. They went on to star more projects throughout the decade including the comedies "Pabling" (1981), "Galawgaw" (1982), and "Inday Bote" (1985), as well as the dramas "Hindi Kita Malimot" (1982), "Teenage Marriage" (1984), and "The Graduates" (1986).

The PMPC honored her with six awards as Best Actress in a Drama Anthology ("The Maricel Soriano Drama Special") in 1988, 1989 and 1992.
Soriano is also considered the "Dancing Queen" of the 1980s, and her signature dance numbers, "I Am What I Am", "Body Dancer", "O La La", "Rico Mambo", Angela Clemmons' "Give Me Just a Little More Time" and Shalamar's "A Night to Remember", among others have continued to be associated with her even to this very day. While not a professional singer, she even managed to record two songs, the theme song of the movie, "Oh, My Mama!" and the gold record hit "Ngayon at Habang Panahon". Aside from a sold out concert at the Smart Araneta Coliseum entitled "Hello, Hello Maricel" in 1987, she has appeared in hit concerts locally and abroad in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

She remained visible on television through her drama anthology "The Maricel Drama Special" which ran for the next seven years.
She was also named as "Drama Anthology Queen" in the early 1990s because of her successful weekly drama show (produced by Regal Films and ABS-CBN) topped the primetime ratings game since its airing in October 1986. In July 1988, Freddie M. Garcia acknowledged that Soriano was the number one star of ABS-CBN, of which he was then the general manager. After two years, she with sister Maria Victoria and former manager Manny Valera established Excellent Productions and took the helm of producing the show. The drama show lasted for ten years and was awarded by the Catholic Mass Media Awards in 1988 and 1989 and the KBP's Golden Dove Media Awards in 1992 and 1993 as outstanding drama anthology. As main performer, she received Star Award's best actress for drama honors in 1988, 1989 and 1992.
2000s: Continued success.
Soriano continued to dominate the big and small screens at the turn of the new millennium with the blockbusters "Mano Po" (2002) and "A Love Story" (2007), and the top-rating sitcom "Kaya ni Mister, Kaya ni Misis" (opposite Cesar Montano), which was eventually retitled "Bida si Mister, Bida si Misis".

She finally made her comeback in 2014 through the hit television series, Ang Dalawang Mrs. Real. It was her first major project as a Kapuso actress which also marked her return on the small screen and then did guesting in "Bubble Gang" and "Sunday PinaSaya".

Soriano is also recognised as the “Drama Anthology Queen” for the success of her two headlining drama series — "Maricel Regal Drama Special" (1987-1990) and "The Maricel Drama Special" (1990-1997), which had a ten-year run in the television altogether and became one of the longest running TV anthology series in Philippine history.
She has been an influential figure to many actors and actresses in the Philippine entertainment industry. Iza Calzado and Jodi Sta. Maria praised her generosity in "giving acting tips to them on the set", calling it the "Inay Maria School of Acting." In 2002, Alessandra de Rossi expressed her desire to follow the career path of Soriano saying: "She's equally effective in drama, comedy and action."

Soriano recorded a few songs in the 1980s including the gold single "Ngayon at Habang Panahon" penned by Tito Sotto and the theme song of her movie "Oh, My Mama!" in 1981.
Controversies.
In 2011, Soriano was publicly accused by two of her former housemaids of mistreatment and drug abuse, which she denied, saying that her accusers had stolen from her. In 2024, she was called to testify in the Philippine Senate after she was accused by a former Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency official of allowing her condominium unit in Makati to be used in narcotics-related activities by prominent personalities including then-Senator Bongbong Marcos. Soriano also denied the allegation, saying that she had sold the condominium unit by the time the activities occurred.

Abraham Mitrie Rihbany

Abraham Dimitri Rihbany known as Abraham Mitrie Rihbany (; sometimes spelled "Rahbany"; August 27, 1869 – July 5, 1944) was an American theologian, philologist and historian of Greek Orthodox Lebanese descent.
""In debt and nearly penniless on his arrival in New York, he went on to become a respected clergyman and nationally recognized community leader"." His best-known book, "The Syrian Christ" (1916), was highly influential in its time in explaining the cultural background to some situations and modes of expression to be found in the Gospels. It is still cited in both Biblical Studies and Sociolinguistics.
Life and Works.
Rihbany was born in Shweir, in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. At 9 years old he was apprenticed to a stone-cutter, but at the age of 17 he managed to attend the American Presbyterian School in Souk El Gharb, catching up on his secondary education in two years of study and briefly becoming a teacher himself. It was here that he became a Presbyterian, in spite of his family's long adherence to the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch.
In 1891 Rihbany emigrated to the United States, in the first instance to New York City, where he briefly edited "Kawkab Amirka" (The Star of America), North America's first Arabic-language newspaper. He left New York in 1893 and travelled through the Mid-West, funding short stints of study at Manchester University (Indiana) (1894) and Ohio Wesleyan University (1895–96) by giving lecture tours to churches on the culture of the Holy Land as a key to the Scriptures. He indefinitely postponed his studies after being offered a position as a resident Congregationalist minister in Morenci, Michigan. Thereafter he served as minister for two years in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, and for nine in Toledo, Ohio, ending up at the Church of the Disciples, a Unitarian church in Boston, Massachusetts.
His first book, "A Far Journey" (1913), was an account of his life in Syria and America. His publisher promoted it as a "bridging of the thousands of years that separate Turkey and the United States".
His ideas about the importance of East-Mediterranean culture to an understanding of the Gospels were developed in a series of articles for "The Atlantic Monthly", and in 1916 published in book form as "The Syrian Christ". This went through numerous American and British editions up to 1937, was translated into German, and has more recently been translated into Arabic and reissued in English.
During the First World War, Rihbany began writing on political issues. His "Militant America and Jesus Christ" (1917) made a case for American involvement in liberating the homeland of Jesus from Ottoman rule and argued against Christian pacifism. The following year he brought out "America Save the Near East", which sold out three editions in twelve months. In it he advocated American trusteeship over an independent Greater Syrian federal republic. Rihbany believed that America stood alone in lacking imperial ambitious in the region and that the United States was uniquely equipped to reshape the region in a progressive fashion. It was due to this publication that he came to attend the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, where he became attached to the entourage of Emir Faisal, the leader of the Arab delegation, as a translator. A Greater Syrian state (the Kingdom of Syria) did briefly come into existence under Faisal before the French Mandate of Syria was imposed in 1920. Rihbany's account of the peace conference, "Wise Men from the East and Wise Men from the West", was in part published in "Harper's Magazine" (Dec. 1921) before being issued as a book.
While promoting Arab nationalist and Anti-Zionist ideas, Rihbany did not stop writing religious pamphlets for the American Unitarian Association, as well as more substantial works of spiritual reflection. One British reviewer of his "Seven Days with God" commented on his "keen spiritual insight and considerable vigour of thought".
Rihbany died in Stamford, Connecticut, in 1944.

Hanoi–Amsterdam High School

Hanoi–Amsterdam High School for the Gifted () is one of the four regional magnet schools in Hanoi, Vietnam. It is regarded as one of the most prestigious and highly ranked academically selective high schools in Vietnam, from Hanoi.
History.
In 1972, as the Vietnam War was in one of its most brutal periods, Hanoi was under heavy bombardment by the US Air Force. Dr. I. Samkalden, the mayor of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, started a campaign to mobilize Dutch people to donate for the establishment of a high school in Hanoi to express their support to its citizens. The result of this campaign was the founding of Hanoi – Amsterdam High School. September 5, 1985, marked the official commencement of the first school year at Hanoi – Amsterdam High School.
In its first year, the school accepted gifted students specializing in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Literature, English and Russian from other schools in Hanoi. The school subsequently over time gained reputation as a premier education hub in Hanoi for its selectivity and dynamic student body, having nurtured several generations of high-accomplishing alumnae in diverse fields locally and abroad.
For its achievements, the school received the 3rd degree Labor Order (1995), the 2nd degree Labor Order (2000), the 1st degree Labor Order (2005), and the title of Hero of Labor (2000) from the Vietnamese government.
In 2010, the school's was relocated to a new campus at Hoang Minh Giam street in commemoration of Millennial Anniversary of Hanoi.
Curriculum.
The school has two levels:
Middle school level.
There are 20 preparatory classes for students of grades 6 to 9. Each year, the school selects gifted students from elementary schools based on competitive examinations. Out of approximately 4,000 students, the top 200 scorers are accepted, marking the acceptance rate as low as 5%. These students enjoy the same education standards and are taught by the same faculty as their peers at the high school level.
Throughout 6th and 7th grade, students will get to enroll in one academic club which does not affect their GPA. As of 2012, students can decide among mathematics in English, elementary Chinese, football (soccer), basketball, and tennis. Students will also take quality-check exams periodically to re-determine which class they will be in during 8th and 9th grade. As of 2018, there are two tracks for students to choose from: natural sciences (three classes) and social sciences &amp; humanities (two classes). Regardless of the track they choose, students can enroll in any academic club the school offers, which consists of mathematics, physics, chemistry, English, and literature.
8th- and 9th-grade students can choose to compete in the Hanoi Middle School Academic Competition. Averaging at 20 students per subject, competing teams will take one test at the regional level and one test at the municipal level against teams from other districts. Students from Hanoi-Amsterdam High School are known to perform exceedingly well, often winning multiple first prizes and top scorers in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, English, and computer science. The selection process is very rigorous and is also known to prepare students for their high school entrance exams.
High school level.
Students are specialized in one of the 12 following subject areas: literature, mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, Russian, English, French, Chinese, geography, and history. Admission is based on the city-wide High School Entrance Examination conducted by the Hanoi Department of Education and Training, with another 90-minute examination on basic English proficiency and additional advanced-level papers in the applicant's intended major. There are a total number of five exams taken on three consecutive days. The acceptance rate is often as low as 3% for the more selective classes, such as English, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. Because of the competitive nature, these majors have two classes (for example, Chemistry 1 and Chemistry 2). All 10th-grade students have to take two quality-check tests (one in November, the other at the end of the school year), the results of which, when combined with their GPA for the major, can re-determine which class the student is in, in their next year. There is no difference in curriculum between the two 10th-grade English, chemistry, physics, and mathematics classes. Starting from grade 11, class 2 will follow an easier, yet still more advanced than basics, major curriculum, while class 1 continues to pursue the specialized major curriculum. The French major has a bilingual class (called French 2) wherein certain subjects are taught in French.
All classes study from 7:30 AM to 12 PM from Monday to Saturday, with most classes having afternoon seminars for two hours, twice per week. Students are required to present from good to excellent study results in all thirteen subjects to remain at the school and are encouraged to explore their specialized subjects in-depth, with opportunities to take part in national and international competitions. After three years, most students enter their favorite universities, many of which are abroad.
Dual degree program.
Starting in the 2018-2019 academic year, the school has agreed with the Ministry of Education to open two more classes (called the Oxford Class and the Cambridge Class in the High School level, and Liverpool Class and Manchester Class for the Middle School level) for the Dual Degree program. On top of the curriculum as described above, students in the Middle School Level will study with the GCSE curriculum, while those in the High School Level will study for the GCE Advanced Level.
Campus.
Academic facilities.
The current campus features:
Athletic facilities.
The school has a soccer field, tennis court, and an indoor gym with a badminton court, volleyball courts, a basketball court, and a swimming pool.

Carmelite Daughters of the Divine Heart of Jesus

The Carmelite Sisters of the Divine Heart of Jesus is a religious institute in the Catholic Church founded by Maria Teresa of St. Joseph (Anna Maria Tauscher) on July 2, 1891, in the Netherlands. Mother Mary Teresa traveled to the United States in 1912 to establish a community in the U.S. The Provincial House was opened in 1917 in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin and the first American postulant was received in 1920 from the Milwaukee area.
Areas of concern.
The charism, or spiritual focus, of this religious institute is to offer reparation to Jesus for the denial and unbelief of his divinity. This is done through prayer, meditation and especially through weekly adoration of the Blessed Sacrament.
The apostolate of the institute is to provide "A home away from home" for children and the elderly. For this purpose the congregation has houses in Europe, the United States, Canada, Central America, South America, and Africa.
In the U.S. the Sisters have cared for the elderly, since 1929, at St. Agnes Home in Kirkwood, MO, since 1952 at the Carmel Nursing Home in Owensboro, KY, since 1917 at St. Joseph Home for the Aged in Kenosha, WI, since 1951 at Saint Ann's Home in Grand Rapids, MI; and since 1954 at Mount Carmel Home in Corpus Christi, TX.
On the same property in Kirkwood, the Sisters care for children ages 2–5 at their Carmelite Child Development Center. They maintain a Residential Treatment Center for boys in Wauwatosa, WI opened in 1917 ; a Residential Treatment Center for girls (originally an orphanage opened in 1913) in East Chicago, IN with an Emergency Shelter Care for infants and small children who are victims of trauma, abuse or neglect.
The General Mother House is in the city of Sittard, the Netherlands; where the Mother General resides. The General Mother House serves as the highest authority after the Pope and the Sacred Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes in Rome as the principal body that regulates religious life in the Congregation.

Holy See–European Union relations

Holy See–European Union relations are the relations between the European Union (EU) and the Holy See (including the Holy See's sovereign territory known as the Vatican City State).
Cooperation.
While neither entity is a member of the European Union, the Holy See and Vatican City are intrinsically linked to the EU. Vatican City has an open border with Italy, and therefore with the entire Schengen Area of which Italy is part. In 2006, Vatican City indicated an interest in joining the Schengen Information System. Both the Holy See and Vatican City use the euro as sole legal currency and Vatican euro coins are minted under an EU-approved agreement with Italy. The EU gave Italy authority to negotiate a deal with the Holy See in 2000 which allowed the Holy See to mint a maximum of €670,000. After a review of the arrangements, a new agreement came into force in 2010, which allowed it to mint €1 million a year (plus up to an additional €300,000 on special occasions).
According to the European Union's Copenhagen criteria for determining eligibility of states to join the EU, a candidate state must be a free market democracy. Given that the Holy See is not a state and Vatican City functions as an elective absolute monarchy with only one major economic actor (the state itself), neither meet the criteria.
Vatican City is not part of the European Union Customs Union or the EU's VAT area, unlike some other small European states. However Vatican City is exempt from duties and taxes and the small amount of goods exported from Vatican City are exempt from duty.
Representations.
The first representative from the Holy See, an Apostolic Nuncio, was accredited to the EU in 1970. The role of the EU's representative to the Holy See is accorded to the EU representative to the UN in Rome: currently Ambassador Yves Gazzo. The first EU representative to the Holy See was Luis Ritto, accredited in 2006. This accreditation followed a visit by Commission President José Manuel Barroso who wished to create open full diplomatic relations between the two.
Points of tension.
The disagreements between European Union and Holy See have been:
Membership.
The Vatican City (the smallest state in the world) is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state, and as such does not have the democratic credentials to join the EU (Art. 49 TEU) and is unlikely to attain them given its unique status. Additionally its economy is also of a unique non-commercial nature. Overall, the mission of the Vatican City state, which is tied to the mission of the Holy See, has little to do with the objectives of the EU Treaty. Thus EU membership is not discussed, even though the country is totally surrounded by an EU member state.

Gersz Rotlewi

Gersz (Georg, George, Gersh) Rotlewi (Rotlevi, Rotlevy) (1889 – 1920) was a Polish chess master.
Biography.
In 1906, Rotlewi tied for 5-6th in Łódź (Akiba Rubinstein won). In 1907, he took 3rd, behind Rubinstein and Dawid Daniuszewski, in Lodz ("Quadrangular"), took 2nd, behind Heilmann, in Ostend (main class I section), and took 6th in Lodz (the 5th Russian Chess Championship; the event was won by Rubinstein). He took 4th in the Prague 1908 chess tournament ("Hauptturnier", preliminary), tied for 1st with Daniuszewski at Lodz 1909, and took 2nd, behind Alexander Alekhine, at Saint Petersburg 1909 (the All-Russian Amateur tournament).
Rotlewi played two matches against Gersz Salwe, losing in 1909 (+5 –8 =5) and winning in 1910 (+3 –1 =6).
In 1910, he tied for 1st with Rubinstein in Warsaw and won in the Hamburg 1910 chess tournament (the 17th DSB Congress, "Hauptturnier A"), which earned him the Master Title and the right {and invitation} to compete at the Carlsbad 1911 chess tournament. In 1911, he took 4th in Carlsbad (Richard Teichmann won). This was the greatest result of Rotlewi's short career. He finished ahead of such prominent players as Frank Marshall, Aron Nimzowitsch, Milan Vidmar, Savielly Tartakower, Alexander Alekhine, and Rudolf Spielmann. In the same year, he tied for 2nd-4th in Cologne (Moishe Lowtzky won) and took 2nd in Munich (Simon Alapin won).
After this, a nervous disorder forced him to give up serious chess. He died in 1920 at the age of 31.

Kuči (tribe)

Kuči (Montenegrin and ; , ) is a tribe of Albanian origin, historically located in modern central and eastern Montenegro (Brda region), north-east of Podgorica, extending along the border with Albania. Processes of Slavicisation during the Ottoman era and onwards facilitated ethno-linguistic shifts within much of the community. As such, people from the Kuči today largely identify themselves as Montenegrins and Serbs, with a minority still identifying as Albanians. In other areas such as the Sandžak, many Muslim descendants of the Kuči today identify as Bosniaks.
The Kuči first appear in historical records in 1330 as a brotherhood from an Albanian katun under the jurisdiction of the Dečani Monastery. The region itself is first mentioned in 1485 as a nahiyah of the Sandjak of Shkodra. Over time, several waves of settlers came to populate the region and form the historical community of Kuči. The region is known for its resistance against Ottoman rule and its key role in the creation of modern Montenegro. Until the 17th century, the Kuči region was equally Orthodox and Catholic. Today, it is mostly Orthodox except for the Catholic community of Koja. Muslim converts appear since 1485. In the 17th and 18th centuries, both voluntarily and non-voluntarily many people from the "pleme" began to settle in the Plav-Gusinje, Rožaje and the wider Sandžak region. Many of their descendants identify as Muslim Bosniaks.
The history of the people of Kuči represents the diversity of the area and its location at the crossroads between different cultures and religions. As such, alongside Marko Miljanov (1833–1901), a national hero of Montenegro who led the tribe in the Montenegrin-Ottoman Wars in 1861–62 and 1876–78, people of Kuči ancestry include and Jakup Ferri (1832–1879), a national hero of Albania who fought against Miljanov's annexation of his home territory Plav to Montenegro. Modern individuals include Momir Bulatović, a Montenegrin politician and the first President of the Republic of Montenegro and Fahrudin Radončić, a Bosniak politician and former Minister of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Name.
Attestation.
The name appears in several Albanian inhabited territories, including toponyms in Shkodër, Tirana, Berat, Vlorë and Korçë, as well as anthroponyms and toponyms among the medieval Albanian communities of the Peloponnese, for example the village of "Kuçi" (modern Chelidoni, known until 1955 as "Koutsi") is recorded as an Albanian settlement ("cemā'at-i Arnavudān") in 1460–3. According to Giuseppe Valentini, also the Arbëreshë surname "Cuccia" directly corresponds to the tribal name of the Kuči. Valentini makes further connections to the Albanian Kuçi of medieval Greece, noting that the Sicilo-Arbëreshë Cuccia family descends from a certain "Pietro Cuccia" who arrived from Greece in 1467. The surname appears at least 19 times among Albanian stradioti recorded between 1482 and 1547, and Valentini notes various toponyms connected to the tribal name across Albania and Arvanite settlements in Greece. According to the tradition of the Berisha tribe, the Old Kuči is called "Berisha i Kuq" (Red Berisha) as opposed to "Berisha i Bardh" (White Berisha), which is used for Berisha of Pukë, Mërturi and a part of Piperi that traces its origin from Berisha.
Etymology.
The etymology of Kuči (Albanian: Kuçi) is unclear.
Many scholars have adopted the view that the etymology of the name is from Albanian "kuq" (Gheg Albanian , "kuç" in the Albanian alphabet) "red", ultimately from Latin "coccaeus" evolved through Albanian phonetic changes. It was first proposed by Gustav Meyer and adopted by Pavle Ivić, Petar Šimunović and many others.
Alternative etymologies from Albanian sources include "kuç" ("puppy, doggie") suggested by Biris (1998), and "kuci" ("place of high altitude, summit, steep high rock") suggested by Sarris (1928) and Fourikis (1929). Stanišić proposes a derivation from Romanian "cuci" ("hills"), from a similar source to Albanian "kuci" ("place of high altitude"). Idriz Ajeti and Eqrem Çabej considered "kuq" improbable and proposed a derivation from "kuç" ("earthen pot", figuratively "valley") as a geographical reference to valley dwellers as the name is widespread in Albanian-speaking groups.
Aleksandar Loma suggests a potential, albeit unclear, connection to the toponym "Kučevo" for which he proposes a number of Slavic (f.e., *"kučь" meaning "Eurasian bittern", *"kuti" meaning "smith") and non-Slavic etymologies; as well as connections to Polish toponyms "Kucz" and "Kuczów".
Geography.
The Kuči region is within the municipality of Podgorica and comprises almost all of eastern Podgorica, with the exception of Koći, which is part of the Tuzi Municipality. The unofficial Kuči centre is the Ubli village, which had 227 inhabitants in the 2011 Montenegrin census and houses several institutions like a culture hall, the "Đoko Prelević" elementary school, a hospital, a police station and a former fabric factory. Ubli is situated in Upper Kuči (Montenegrin and ) and includes the villages of Prelevići, Pavićevići, Živkovići, Kostrovići and Rajovići. The other villages of Upper Kuči are Medun, Orahovo, Bezjovo, Cvilin, Fundina, Koći, Kržanja, Kosor, Liješta, Dučići, Vrbica, Donje Stravče, Gornje Stravče, Zaugao, Brskut, Zagreda, Momče, Ubalac and Raći. Lower Kuči (Montenegrin and ) comprises the localities of Doljani, Murtovina, Stara Zlatica and Zlatica.
The Kuči region itself can be divided into two major historical sub-regions:
An area that is also considered part of the wider Kuči region is that of Koja, a Catholic Albanian tribe. It became part of Montenegro in 1880 and it includes the settlements of Koći and Fundina. The region of Koja stands between Triepshi in the south and Kuči proper in the north. The people of Koja are referred to as "Kojanë".
Some villages stand between the Kuči sub-regions. For example, the village of Orahovo is located between Old Kuči and Koja. Other settlements that were once part of one Kuči tribal region moved over time to other regions.
History.
Origins.
Albanian in origin, Kuči underwent a process of gradual cultural integration into the neighbouring Slavic population.
The Kuči are first attested to in 1330, in the second and third charters of the Dečani chrysobulls. There, a certain "Petar Kuč" (Albanian: "Pjetër Kuçi") is recorded, an individual from the Albanian katun (), considered to have been the leader of the Kuči brotherhood. Contrary to the Vlach katuns mentioned in the charters, no indication is given on the location of the Albanian katun, however Branislav Djurdjev proposed that it must have been located in Zeta.
Kuči is mentioned again in the Venetian cadaster of 1416–7 of Shkodra, where the village of "Kuç" ("Kuč"), is listed as a small settlement of eight households near the city itself, headed by a "Jon Nada". Two other heads of households are sons of Nenad, Gjergj ("Giergi" in the original document) and Lazër ("Lazzaro"). A person married into the village is "Jon Progani", who was married to "Nesa" (a diminutive of the name "Nenada"). His son, Gjin Progani was also a household head as were "Jon Serapa" and "Gjergj Tina" and "Pali Samrishi". They paid one ducat per household in taxes to the Venetian governor of Scutari. Members of this brotherhood also lived in other villages in the area like in Shurdhani, where three out of six households were from Kuçi. The region on the eastern shore of Lake Shkodra and the parishes of Zeta became the territory where the Kuči, along with other communities, such as the Bitidosi and Bushati would eventually migrate and settle in.
In 1455 the Kuči, who some scholars speculate may not have fully territorialized as a tribe, took part in an assembly alongside 50 other tribes of the Upper Zeta region. As a result of this assembly, the Lord of Zeta Stefan Crnojević was granted the consent and authority to sign an agreement with the Republic of Venice, according to which Zeta was placed under Venetian jurisdiction; albeit under the condition that the Metropolitan of Zeta would not be subordinated to the Catholic Church.
Ottoman.
In the Ottoman defter of the Sanjak of Scutari in 1485, Kuči appears as a nahiye for the first time in its modern location. At this point, the nahiye of Kuči comprised communities that later formed two different administrative units and bajraks: Kuči and Triepshi. The total number of households in the eight settlements of the nahiya were 253. These (with household numbers in brackets) were: Pantalesh (110), Brokina (12), Bardhani (25), Radona (55), Bankeq (11), Stani (24), Bytidosi (11), Llazorçi (5). Llazorçi was a settlement of another small tribe, the Lazori who appear as part of the Albanian katun in 1330. By 1485, they had moved northwards with the Kuči brotherhoods. Bankeq and a part of Bytidosi are related with the historical region of Triepshi. In terms of anthroponymy the demographics of the area showed a cohabitation of Albanian and Slavic names. In the 253 households, 105 households heads had Albanian names, 53 had mixed Albanian-Slavic names and 91 had Slavic names. About 2/3 of the Slavic anthroponymy (59 households) was concentrated in two settlements, Radona and Stani. Radona also had about 1/5 of the mixed Slavic Orthodox-Albanian anthroponymy and it was the only settlement of Kuči in 1485 where Muslim converts lived (5/55 households).
In the 1497 defter, it had 338 households in eleven settlements including new or renamed settlements like Pavlovići, Petrovići, Lješovići (Leshoviq), Lopari, Banjovići and Koći (Koja). This increase by 85 households in a few years represents a wave of refugees and other communities that settled in the area as the Ottomans were consolidating their power base. Pavlovići and Banjovići, which represent more than half of the new households have a predominantly Slavic Orthodox anthroponymy. Koći is the historical settlement of the Catholic Albanian Koja tribe that would fully form in later years. Leshoviq/Lješovići had come to the area from the Catholic Albanian Kelmendi tribe to the south of Kuči. Many of these brotherhoods no longer exist, while some of them became part of Trieshi and Koja e Kuçit. 
These formed "Old Kuči" (), who were a community of diverse brotherhoods (clans), in relation to the Drekalovići who claimed ancestry from a single ancestor. J. Erdeljanović found, in the Old Kuči, very noticeable instances of the merging of various brotherhoods into one over time. The merging was so finalized that it was hard for him to mark off the parts of those composite brotherhoods, "even the searching in that direction was also encountered by the apprehension of said individuals". With the arrival of the Drekalovići, the old families called themselves "Old Kuči".
According to certain oral traditions and legends, the Old Kuči descend from an ancestor named "Panta". In relation to this, scholars such as Djurdjev and Pulaha have asserted that this tradition is reflected in the historical record with the attestation of Pantalesh, the main settlement of the Kuči recorded in the Ottoman register of 1485. The settlement is deemed to have been named after its founder, Panta Lleshi, who likely lived during the first half of the 15th century. Furthermore, folk legends note that Panta had a number of sons among which "Mara", "Llesh", "Pjetri", and "Gjergj" appear to be reflected in the Ottoman register through the surnames and patronyms of household heads. The katuns of Petrovići and Lješovići possibly branched off from the settlement of Pantalesh and were descended from Panta's sons Pjetri and Llesh.
Another wave of settlement in the mid 16th century is that of the Drekalovići, who came to form an important part of Kuči.
In the second half of the 16th century, in particular between 1560–1571, armed uprisings spread in the northen Albanian territories of Mirdita, Shkodra, Kelmendi, Kuçi, and Pipri, fighting against the Ottoman Empire that was still at its pinnacle of power. Albanian uprisings intensified – especially in the Sanjak of Scutari and Sanjak of Dukagjin – during the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 when the Porte faced the forces of the Catholic powers of the Holy League.
In a 1582/83 defter (Ottoman tax registry), the Kuči nahiya had 13 villages, belonging to the Sanjak of Scutari. Anthroponymy in the region was mixed. In the settlements of Bankeq, Bytadosa, Bardić, Lazarniči, and Lješovići, mixed Albanian-Slavic anthroponyms now predominated over typical Albanian personal names, borne by a minority of household heads. However, in the villages of Petrovići, Koći, and Brokina half of household heads bore typical Albanian anthroponyms, the other half bearing mixed Albanian-Slavic names. In contrast, typical Slavic anthroponymy dominated in Pavlovići and Radona. This period marks the time where Albanian toponymy begins to be either translated into Slavic or acquire Slavic suffixes like in the village of Bardhani that begins to appears as "Bardić", and in Llazorçi which appears as "Lazarniči". Administratively, the Kuči, Bratonožići and part of Plav were under the soldiers of Medun and its spahi, but the commander was not named. They were also subject to taxation, despite having some autonomy.
In 1610, the Kuči ("Cucci") are mentioned by Marino Bizzi as being half Orthodox and half Catholic ("la metà scismatica e l'altra latina").
In 1613, the Ottomans launched a campaign against the rebel tribes of the northern Albanian territories. In response, the tribes of the Vasojevići, Kuči, Bjelopavlići, Piperi, Kastrati, Kelmendi, Shkreli and Hoti formed a political and military union known as “The Union of the Mountains” or “The Albanian Mountains” . The leaders swore an oath of "besa" to resist with all their might any upcoming Ottoman expeditions, thereby protecting their self-government and disallowing the establishment of the authority of the Ottoman Spahis in the northern highlands. Their uprising had a liberating character. With the aim of getting rid of the Ottomans from the Albanian territories
In 1614 Kuči are described in terms of ethnicity and religion in 1614 by a well-informed and trusted person of the Venetians – Mariano Bolizza – who describes the Kuči as Albanian Catholics. In his report, Bolizza notes that "Lale Drecalou" (Lale Drekalov/Lalë Drekali) and "Nico Raizcou" (Niko Rajckov/Niko Raiku) were the commanders of the Catholic Albanian Kuči ("Chuzzi Albanesi") which had 490 households and 1,500 men-in-arms described as "very war-like and courageous". In 1614, Lale Drekalov was one of the chief participants and organizers of the assembly of Kuçi. In that assembly 44 leaders mostly from northern Albania and Montenegro took part to organize an insurrection against the Ottomans and ask for assistance by the Papacy. Gjon Renësi had undertaken the task of presenting the decisions of the assembly to the Papacy. The leaders who participated in the assembly also decided to send a proclamation to the kings of Spain and France claiming they were independent from Ottoman rule and did not pay tribute to the empire. It was followed by an assembly in Prokuplje in 1616 and another one in 1620 in Belgrade, where he appears as one of the participants. In this period they continue to appear as subjects of the Ottoman Empire.
The first half of the 17th century is marked by an important event in the religious history of Kuči. Voivode Lale Drekalov, who was a Catholic, converted to Orthodoxy in his second marriage to a relative of the voivode of the Bratonožići tribe. The main reasons that have been put forward to explain this decision include his shift in orientation of political alliances towards the Orthodox tribes of Montenegro, the influence of the Orthodox Church in the region and the increasing disappointment towards the Catholic powers in Europe that were considered to have abandoned their allies in the Balkans. Drekalov's conversion was soon followed by a gradual conversion of all Catholics of Kuči. As Francesco Bolizza notes in a letter to Cardinal Caponi in 1649, about three or four Catholic villages remained in Kuči under the jurisdiction of the Franciscan mission of Gruda. According to Historians Simo Milutinović and Dimitrije Milaković, the Catholic Kuči, Bratonožići and Drekalovići tribe has converted to Orthodoxy by Rufim Boljević.
A 1652 Franciscan report by Giacinto Sospello illustrates the final stages of the acculturation of the Kuči. Sospello writes: "I do not want to deal here with Zeta near Shestan, which is part of Montenegro, where people practice the Orthodox rites and speak the Slavic language: the local people are not part of the Albanian nation. But I will talk about four tribes, the tribes of Piperi, Bratonožići, Bjelopavlići and Kuči. Based on their outstanding fighting skills they seem to have Albanian blood, and in fact Albanians consider them to be so. However, since almost everyone applies the Orthodox rites and speaks the Slavic language, they can be considered more Slavs than Albanians."
The political alliances in Europe did not allow for a coherent strategy to emerge in assistance of a pan-Balkan coalition against the Ottomans. In 1658, in another attempt to form an anti-Ottoman coalition the seven tribes of Kuči, Vasojevići, Bratonožići, Piperi, Kelmendi, Hoti and Gruda allied themselves with the Republic of Venice, establishing the so-called "Seven-fold barjak" or "alaj-barjak.
In 1688, the Kuči, with help from Kelmendi and Piperi, destroyed the army of Süleyman Pasha twice, took over Medun and got their hands of large quantities of weapons and equipment. In the same year, the Kuči are still considered Albanian by the German historian Christoph Boethius, renowned for his studies on the Ottoman Wars.
In 1689, an uprising broke out in Piperi, Rovca, Bjelopavlići, Bratonožići, Kuči and Vasojevići, while at the same time an uprising broke out in Prizren, Peja, Pristina and Skopje, and then in Kratovo and Kriva Palanka in October (Karposh's Rebellion).
In 1699, the Kuçi appeared for the most part to have converted to the Orthodox religion, while a smaller part, the Triepshi, continued to preserve the Catholic faith, although both Kuçi groups were allies ("confederati").
At the beginning of the 18th century, some people from the Kuči and Kelmendi were forcibly resettled by the Ottomans in the southern parts of the Sandžak, especially in the hills of the Pešter plateau, around Sjenica, and in the land strip between Novi Pazar, Tutin, Rožaje and Plav. Many of these converted to Islam over time and came to form an important part of the Muslim population in these regions.
In 1774, in the same month of the death of Šćepan Mali, Mehmed Pasha Bushati attacked the Kuči and Bjelopavlići, but was subsequently decisively defeated and returned to Scutari. Bushati had broken into Kuči and "destroyed" it; the Rovčani housed and protected some of the refugee families. 
In 1794, the Kuči and Rovčani were devastated by the Ottomans.
From the late 17th to the early 18th century, many brotherhoods that were from Kuči left the area whether as refugees from Ottoman punitive campaigns or simply as emigrants and settled further north, mostly in the Sandzak area, where many converted to Islam. The movements and conversion included about 30 of the 86 brotherhoods which lived in Kuči at the time.
Modern.
The Ottoman increase of taxes in October 1875 sparked the Great Eastern Crisis, which included a series of rebellions, firstly with the Herzegovina Uprising (1875–77), which prompted Serbia and Montenegro declaring war on the Ottoman Empire (see Serbian–Ottoman War and Montenegrin–Ottoman War) and culminated with the Russians following suit (Russo-Turkish War). In Kuči, chieftain Marko Miljanov Popović organized resistance against the Ottomans and joined forces with the Montenegrins. The Kuči, identifying as a Serb tribe, asked to be united with Montenegro. After the Berlin Congress, Kuči was included into the borders of the Principality of Montenegro.
At the Battle of Novšiće, following the Velika attacks (1879), the battalions of Kuči, Vasojevići and Bratonožići fought the Albanian irregulars under the command of Ali Pasha of Gusinje, and were defeated.
Anthropology.
Ethnography.
Like many rural areas in Montenegro and the Balkans in general, Kuči has suffered heavily from emigration since the collapse of Yugoslavia. The 2011 Montenegrin census recorded about 1,000 inhabitants in total in the villages traditionally associated with Kuči. Two major ethnic groups inhabit the region: ethnic Montenegrins and ethnic Serbs (see Montenegrin Serbs), though these may be regarded as one, as some families may politically be split between the two, i.e. with one brother opting for a Montenegrin identity and another a Serb. Most of the inhabitants are followers of the Serbian Orthodox Church, while a minority are ethnic Muslims. There is an enclave of Roman Catholic Albanians in the village of Koći ("Koja" in Albanian) and Fundina.
Christian Orthodox residents used to be split into two distinct groups: "Old Kuči" ("Starokuči") and "Drekalovići/New Kuči". Mariano Bolizza in his voyage in the area in 1614 recorded that Lale Drekalov and Niko Raičkov held 490 houses of the "Chuzzi Albanesi" ("Albanian Kuči", a village of predominantly Roman Catholic religion), with 1,500 soldiers, described as "very war-like and courageous". The Drekalovići, the largest brotherhood of Kuči, numbered close to 800 households in 1941, roughly half of all of Kuči.
The Islamization of Kuči has made a minority of inhabitants declaring as simply Montenegrins, or Muslims by ethnicity, and Bosniaks although they trace the same origin with that of their Christian brethren.
Oral traditions.
There are various oral traditions with varying degrees of consistency with archival records. In Montenegro, Marko Miljanov himself from Kuči wrote in his book about his home region that the Kuči and Berisha were "regarded close", allegedly because the Berisha ancestors settled from Kuči; Konstantin Jireček further recorded about this story that Old Kuči ("Staro Kuči"), which placed a "Grča", son of "Nenad" as its ancestor also placed him as an ancestor of the Berisha tribe. On the contrary, in Berisha it is believed that Old Kuči itself descends from Berisha and is called "Berisha i Kuq" (Red Berisha) as opposed to Berisha of Pukë, Mërturi and a part of Piperi that traces its origin from Berisha, who are collectively called "Berisha i Bardh" (White Berisha). In historical record, Berisha and the Old Kuči appear in different areas and timelines as Old Kuči formed part of the tribe of current Kuči, which was based on different ancestral groups in the late 15th century . Nevertheless, if not kin by blood, Montenegrin and Albanian tribes regarded closeness in original or home territory from where someone "came". Therefore, Serbian geographer Andrija Jovićević put forward the narrative that the Kuči were "kin" to Kastrati, Berisha and Kelmendi because their distant ancestor once, ostensibly, settled in the same general area as Kuči.
Another late 19th century tradition was recorded by Jovan Erdeljanović in Kuči, the most intricate versions of which were from Kržanj, Žikoviće, Kostroviće, Bezihovo, Kute, Podgrad and Lazorce. According to this story, the Old Kuči descended from Gojko, the brother of King Vukašin. His descendants were forced to flee Shkodra with the Ottoman invasion and settled in Brštan. Gojko Mrnjavčevic, however, is a fictional character in Serb epic poetry, who dies in the 1371 Battle of Maritsa in folk tradition itself.
Language.
The South Slavic dialect spoken in Kuči forms a speech group with Bratonožići and Piperi. South Slavic in these three communities is marked by close contact with the northern Albanian dialects of Malësia. This is especially apparent in the dialects of Kuči and Bratonožići, largely because of the historic bilingualism that was present in the area.
However, as Kuči is in a transitional area between the Albanian and Slavic languages, it has become the subject of historiographical dispute. In particular, Serbian historiography has been criticized, as muting in the area Albanian and Slavic symbiosis and bilingualism in favor of a monoethnic and monolingual Serbian narrative, a trend evident in ethnographers of the early 20th century like Jovan Erdeljanović and Jovan Cvijić. Older Serbian or Yugoslav historiography and ethnography on the Kuči conflated the Ottoman nahiye of Kuči—an administrative unit composed of different communities—with the Kuči tribe. As such, the Albanian tribes that were within the nahiye and would later be administratively within Kuči following the incorporation of their lands into the Montenegrin state, such as Trieshi and Koja e Kuçit, were treated as branches or regions of the Kuči tribe despite their distinct histories and identities.
Culture.
In terms of traditional customs, up to the end of the 19th century traces of a variant of the northern Albanian kanuns remained in use in Kuči. Marie Amelie von Godin in her travels still reported traces of bilingualism in the area of Kuči. According to her reports, although Albanian was no longer spoken in the area, some laments and oaths were still being sung and recited in Albanian.

Headstrong (Trapt song)

"Headstrong" is the first single released by the American rock band Trapt from their 2002 debut album "Trapt". It reached 1 on the US "Billboard" Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock Tracks charts and No. 16 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. It crossed over to mainstream pop radio, peaking at No. 4 on the "Billboard" Mainstream Top 40. The song also won two "Billboard" Music Awards in 2003 for "Best Modern Rock Track" and "Best Rock Track".
"Billboard" rated "Headstrong" the No. 1 modern rock and mainstream rock song of 2003. In September 2023, for the 35th anniversary of Modern Rock Tracks (which had been renamed to Alternative Airplay), "Billboard" ranked the song at No. 60 on its list of the 100 most successful songs in the chart's history. In 2018, an official poll by Ultimate Guitar saw the site's users rate "Headstrong" as having the fourth-worst riff of all time.
Music video.
A music video was produced for "Headstrong" which shows the band performing in front of a crowd. Paper and other debris are seen flying past in furious winds as the group plays in an urban nighttime setting, as well as a couple of teenagers arguing with the people they know, such as one teen getting into an argument with his father while they are in a car and the kid becomes fed up with his father's attitude and storms off as well as another teen quitting his job at a restaurant after getting pushed around by his boss; the two teens then join Trapt in the crowd. A third teen is seen walking through the crowd and eventually graffitis Trapt's logo on a wall. The video found considerable airplay on MTV2 and MMUSA upon release. The video was directed by Brian Scott Weber.

Dava Newman

Dava J. Newman (born 1964) is an American aerospace engineer. She is the director of the MIT Media Lab and a former deputy administrator of NASA. Newman is the Apollo Program Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Engineering Systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She has been a faculty member in the department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and MIT's School of Engineering since 1993.
Newman earned her PhD in aerospace biomedical engineering, and Master of Science degrees in aerospace engineering and technology and policy all from MIT, and her Bachelor of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Notre Dame. She is a member of the faculty at the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology and a MacVicar Faculty Fellow. She formerly directed the Technology and Policy Program at MIT (2003–2015) and the MIT Portugal Program since 2011.
Research.
Newman's research expertise is in aerospace biomedical engineering, investigating human performance in varying gravity environments. Newman was the principal investigator on four spaceflight missions. The Space Shuttle Dynamic Load Sensors (DLS) experiment measured astronaut-induced disturbances of the microgravity environment on mission STS-62. The Enhanced Dynamic Load Sensors experiment flew on board the Mir Space Station from 1996–1998. Newman was a Co-Investigator on the Mental Workload and Performance Experiment (MWPE) that flew on STS-42 to measure astronaut mental workload and fine motor control in microgravity. She also developed the MICR0-G space flight experiment to provide a sensor suite and study human adaptation in extreme environments. She was the MIT Principal Investigator on the Gravity Loading Countermeasure Suit, or Skinsuit, which flew the International Space Station as an ESA technology demonstration from 2015 to 2017.
Newman has promoted the development of space activity suits, namely the Bio-Suit, which provides pressure through compression directly on the skin via the suit's textile weave, patterning, and advanced materials rather than with pressurized gas. The suit is designed to help astronauts move around more easily than gas-filled suits allow. These spacesuit technologies are now being applied to "soft suits" to study and enhance locomotion on Earth. Newman is the author of "Interactive Aerospace Engineering and Design", an introductory engineering textbook, has published more than 300 papers in journals and refereed conferences, and holds numerous compression technology patents.
NASA deputy administratorship.
In October 2014, Newman was nominated by President Barack Obama as deputy administrator of NASA, but the U.S. Senate returned the nomination to the president in December 2014 when the 113th Congress adjourned without having confirmed her for the position. Under Senate rules, in order for Newman to be confirmed, Obama needed to re-nominate her to the Senate of the 114th Congress, and he did so on January 8, 2015. Her confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation was held March 25, 2015, and the committee unanimously recommended approval by the full Senate. She was confirmed by the Senate on April 27, 2015. She resigned the position upon the end of the Obama administration on January 20, 2017.
Honors.
Select honors include named among World's Most Influential Women Engineers (2021), Lowell Thomas Award (Explorer's Club (2018), the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (2017), Women in Aerospace Leadership Award (2017), and the Aerospace Medical Association's Henry L. Taylor Award for Outstanding Accomplishment in Aerospace Human Factors (2017). Her BioSuit spacesuit system has been exhibited at the Venice Biennial (2015), the American Museum of Natural History (2012), the Victoria and Albert and Museum, London (2012), the Paris City Museum of Science and Industry (2010), the London Museum of Science and Industry (2009), and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (2008). She was awarded Best Invention of 2007 by "Time" magazine, named in 100 Extraordinary Women Engineers in 2004, and received the Women in Aerospace National Aerospace Educator Award (2001).
Newman is a former housemaster of MIT's Baker House.

Sporting CP (futsal)

Sporting Clube de Portugal (), otherwise referred to as Sporting CP is a professional futsal club and based in Lisbon, Portugal. The futsal section was founded in 1985, and began playing in the newly created Portuguese First division in 1990. As inaugural winners 1990-91 season, they are the most decorated team in Portugal and a founding member of Portuguese Futsal, having won the UEFA Futsal Champions League two times.
Sporting have made the last 14 Portuguese National Futsal finals and winning 11, with the club winning 3 straight Portuguese championships in 1993-95, 2016-18 and another 3 straight tiles in 2021-23, making it their third three peat in their history. The 2023-24 season, Sporting added a fourth straight championship making it the quadruple in a row and the club’s 19th championship overall.
In addition, they have also won 4 Taças de Honra, 5 Campeonatos da AF Lisboa and 5 Taças Comunicação Social, with a total of 14 regional titles.
History.
Futsal was introduced in Sporting Clube de Portugal in 1985. As a founding member of the first Portuguese League Championship in 1991, Sporting won the league for its first success and inaugural season of Futsal first division. Sporting's first hat trick of came in 1993-95 and from there on started becoming a dominant force as years progressed and have forged a bitter rivalry with their cross town rivals S.L. Benfica. Just like in Football, matches between these two teams is the main highlight of the Portuguese Futsal in all competitions and known as the Lisbon Derby.
In 1995, Sporting fans were forced to choose the modalities to keep in the club, due to financial problems, having chosen handball and futsal, leading to the closure of the basketball, hockey and volleyball sections (which have all returned in the meantime).
In 2002, futsal is officially adopted by UEFA and the UEFA Futsal Cup was created. This first edition was played in Lisbon and organized by Sporting Clube de Portugal, which represented the country as national champion and reached the semi-finals. The 2014-15 edition was also held in Lisbon with Sporting CP once again reaching the final four.
In 2019, Sporting CP won their first UEFA Futsal Champions League after defeating tournament hosts Kairat Almaty by 2-1. In 2021, Sporting CP won their second Futsal Champions League title defeating FC Barcelona 4-3 in Zadar, Croatia. In the 2020-21 season Sporting won its 16th Portuguese First Division Title, beating their eternal rivals Benfica 3-1 at Pavilhão Fidelidade, thus completing the quadruple for the calendar season (minus the Portuguese Cup: cancelled due to Covid-19) and extending Sportings' hegemony in Portuguese futsal.
Domestically and Internationally Sporting is currently the most decorated team in Portugal, with a total of 48 trophies: 19 Portuguese League titles, 10 Portuguese Cups, 6 League Cups, 11 Super Cups and 2 UEFA Futsal Champions League. Overall, Sporting holds the record for all five major competitions listed then any other Portuguese Futsal team and are seen as the greatest team of the modern era.
Facilities.
Pavilhão João Rocha.
Pavilhão João Rocha is a multi-sports pavilion located in the parish of Lumiar, in Lisbon. Located next to the Estádio José Alvalade, it is the home of Sporting CP sports. In honor of one of the most distinguished figures in the history of Sporting, the pavilion was named after former club president, João Rocha, who remained in office from September 1973 to October 1986. Its inauguration took place on the day June 21, 2017.

<doc id="7033615" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7033615" title="Vasconic substrate hypothesis">
Vasconic substrate hypothesis

The Vasconic substrate hypothesis is a proposal that several Western European languages contain remnants of an old language family of Vasconic languages, of which Basque is the only surviving member. The proposal was made by the German linguist Theo Vennemann, but has been rejected by other linguists.
According to Vennemann, Vasconic languages were once widespread on the European continent before they were mostly replaced by Indo-European languages. Relics of these languages include toponyms across Central and Western Europe.
Basis of the hypothesis.
Theo Vennemann based his hypothesis on the works of Hans Krahe, who postulated an Old European substrate as the origin of the European hydronymy (Old European hydronymy). He classified the substratum language as Indo-European.
Vennemann rejected the classification. He gives the following reasons:
The hypothesis and its evidence.
Vennemann developed his ideas in a series of papers which were collected in a book called "Europa Vasconica–Europa Semitica".
He accepts Krahe's theory that there was a uniform Old European language, which is the origin of the Old European hydronymy, but proposes that it is of Vasconic origin. Vasconic is a language family proposed by Vennemann encompassing Basque (its only extant member), Aquitanian, Ligurian, and possibly Iberian and Proto-Sardinian.
Vennemann proposes that this uniform Vasconic substrate must come from a linguistically uniform population, which can only exist within a small area. He therefore proposes that during the last Ice Age, the Vasconic people lived in the modern region of Aquitania. As the glaciers retreated, the Vasconics began moving to the north and south, settling most of Western and Central Europe, spreading their language. They gave names to the rivers and places. This toponymy mostly persisted after the Vasconic language was replaced by Indo-European languages in most of their area, of which the present Basque area in northern Spain and southern France is postulated to be a relic.
Evidence cited by Vennemann.
In support of this argument, Vennemann cites, "inter alia":
Vigesimal numerical systems.
Elements of vigesimal ("base-20") counting and number systems, which Vennemann regards as a trait of Vasconic languages, exist in Celtic, Danish and French.
Genetics.
Evidence from genetics and blood types shows that the modern Basque people share physical characteristics with old populations throughout Western and Central Europe, especially in likely refugia areas, such as mountain ranges.
Reception.
General criticism.
The hypothesis has been largely rejected by historical linguists. Vennemann's theories on "Vasconic" toponymy and hydronymy were opposed by linguists such as P. R. Kitson (1996), and Baldi &amp; Richard (2006), who pointed out that most linguists see unusual European hydronyms as more likely to have Indo-European roots of some kind, and the Indo-European linguist Michael Meier-Brügger.
German linguist Dieter H. Steinbauer argued that it is difficult to argue on the basis of Basque because:
Steinbauer also criticized Vennemann for
The Bascologist Joseba Lakarra rejects Vennemann's Vasconic etymologies, as he considers them to be incompatible with the current state of research on historical phonology and morphology of Basque. Larry Trask concludes that Vennemann found an agglutinating language unrelated to Basque, which could e.g. be Indo-European.
Harald Bichlmeier points out that Vennemann compares the etymological roots of the toponymy with modern Basque words. This is incoherent, as the comparison should be done using the reconstructed forms of Proto-Basque.
Jürgen Udolph shows that some of the assumed Vasconic roots are in fact Indo-European like Vennemann's *muna, especially since Proto-Basque lacked word initial /m/. Stefan Georg adds, that some roots do not exist in Basque or Proto-Basque.
According to Lutz Reichardt the hypothesis is based on the assumption that "settlement continuity exists and that this means continuity of names throughout all languages being spoken in that settlement". Furthermore, he criticizes the methodology applied by those who support the Vasconian hypothesis:
Hayim Y. Sheynin, an expert on Semitic languages, reviewed the work of Vennemann and concluded that his reasoning is based on outdated data and scientific works rejected by critics. He states that much of the evidence presented for an Afro-Asiatic stratum is objectable and based on mere sound similarities only.
Peter Anreiter noted that toponymy with an unknown meaning can be "interpreted" in almost any language. To demonstrate his point, he then "interprets" the Vasconisms proposed by Vennemann as Turkish words. Nonetheless, he states that words with plausible Indo-European etymology should be considered as toponymy of Indo-European origin.
Piotr Gąsiorowski cautioned that it is unclear whether or not an Old European Hydronymy exists at all. According to him it is mere speculation to postulate an etymology for similarly appearing toponymy from a vast area without being able to show that they are indeed from the same substratum.
Origin of the vigesimal numerical systems in Europe.
Vennemann argues that the vigesimal numerical systems in the modern Celtic languages, in French and Danish are a remnant of the Vasconic vigesimal counting system. According to Manfred Kudlek, Old Irish and Gallic did not have vigesimal counting systems and neither did Old Norse. The vigesimal systems in the respective languages developed during the Middle Ages, e.g. Danish started to use a vigesimal system in the 13th/14th century. Therefore, the French system cannot be the result of Celtic influence. Kudlek proposes that the Celtic and Danish systems are loans from French. Brigitte Bauer, too, rejects substratal influence. She suggests that intrasocietal developments, e.g. in the monetary system, may explain the adoption of vigesimal systems.
Genetics.
Manfred Kayser and Lutz Roewer, both experts on genetics, commented in 2013 that genetics do not reveal anything about the languages spoken by the individuals. Furthermore, the information genetics can deliver on population historical hypothesis is limited.
Dieterlen and Bengtson find the distribution of blood factors and haploid groups is convincing evidence for Basque settlement in Western Europe before the Indo-Europeans settled there in line with Vennemann's hypothesis. They note that similarity between the distributions in Basque areas and Sardinia.

Tom O'Sullivan (Rathmore Gaelic footballer)

Tom O'Sullivan is a former Gaelic footballer from Rathmore County Kerry. A garda by profession, he played his club football for Rathmore and his county football for the Kerry county team. 
Playing career.
Underage and junior.
O'Sullivan never played football for Kerry in the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship. However, he was part of the Kerry Vocational Schools team that won the All Ireland in 1997.
He moved on to the Under 21 team in 1998 lining out at full back in the Munster semi final game with Clare, a game Kerry ran out winnings in a close game on a 0-10 to 0-07 scoreline. This set up a Munster Under-21 Football Championship final with Tipperary. In another close game Kerry ended on the right side of a 3-10 to 1-11 scoreline to give O'Sullivan a first Munster title in the grade. The All Ireland semi final paired Kerry with Ulster championships Armagh. Unlike during Munster Kerry ran out comfortable winners on a 1-14 to 0-09 point scoreline, with O'Sullivan once again at full back. This set up an All Ireland final with Laois. Despite fielding a number of players who had won All Ireland minor titles the 2 previous years O'Sullivan's side won 2-08 to 0-11 scoreline to give Kerry their 3 title in 4 years and a first for O'Sullivan. O'Sullivan was back in the no 3 jersey for the start of the 1999 championship as Kerry ran out easy winners in the first round on a 1-22 to 1-04 scoreline against Waterford. This set up a semi final with Limerick. Despite having appeared in 2 Munster minor finals in the years before Kerry had little trouble overcoming them on a 3-12 to 0-06 scoreline. That result set up a Munster final with Cork. Despite being closer than the first two games O'Sullivan's side still ran out comfortable 1-10 to 0-07 winners, giving O Sullivan his second Munster title. In the semi-final Kerry had yet another comfortable win this time over Roscommon on a 3-15 to 109 scoreline. In the final Kerry would face Leinster surprise package Weastmeath. Having not been tested all year Kerry went into the game as huge favorites. However at the final whistle Kerry found themselves at the wrong end of a 1-12 to 0-09 scoreline in one of the biggest shocks in the history of the championship. O'Sullivan played 9 games in total for the under 21s during his 2 years all at full back.
On the back of his displays with the under 21s O'Sullivan was picked for the Kerry junior side in 1998. He played full back in the Munster semi final as Kerry were held to an 0-11 each draw by Cork. In the replay Cork won by 0-15 to 0-13. He was back once more at full back in 1999, however this time Kerry fell to Clare by 0-10 to 0-06.
Senior.
Tom O'Sullivan made his debut for the Kerry seniors against Cork in the 1999/2000 National Football League. He would go on to play in all 8 of Kerrys games as they lost out to Meath in the semi-final. His Munster Senior Football Championship debut came in 2000, also against Cork in the Munster semi final, a game where he played at Left half back, despite having played most of his intercounty football at full back. Kerry won the game 2-15 to 0-13. This paved the way for O'Sullivans first senior Munster final where his side took on Clare. In a one sided game Kerry ran out winners on a 3-15 to 0-08 scoreline. This set up a semi final and Croke Park debut with Ulster champions Armagh. In an exciting game the side were level at the end of 70 minutes 2-11 apace. The replay turned out to be yet another exciting contest, going to extra time with Kerry winning out on a 2-15 to 1-15 scoreline. This put Kerry back in the final for the first time since 1997, with Galway the opposition. Like the semi-final the two teams ended level after a close encounter on a 0-14 each scoreline. In the replay, again like the semi-final another close game played out with Kerry winning on a 0-17 to 1-10 scoreline, giving O'Sullivan his first All Ireland medal. In his debut season with Kerry O'Sullivan played 8 league and 6 championship games.
O'Sullivan missed some of Kerry's 2000/01 league campaign, playing in 5 of the 7 games, only starting two of them. He was back in the starting 15 for the first round of Munster where Kerry took on Tippereary, with him moving to right half back, where he would play for the season. Kerry started the defense of their Munster and All Ireland titles with a comfortable 3-17 to 1-04 hammering of Tipp. This set up a semi final with Limerick, in a game where Kerry again ran out comfortable 1-15 to 0-10 winners. This set up a first Munster final for O'Sullivan with Cork. In the end of a huge scoring game Kerry were winners on a 0-19 to 1-13 scoreline, giving O'Sullivan a second Munster title in a row. 2001 was the first year of the qualifier series meaning for the first time there was a quarter final stage, where Kerry met Dublin. In a first meeting for the sides since the golden days of the 1970s and 80s, the two sides played out a 1-14 easch draw in Thurles. A week later the two teams were back in Thurles and after another exciting game Kerry ran out winners on a 2-12 to 1-12 scoreline. That result set up an All Ireland semi final with Leinster champions Meath. Kerry went into the game as favorites but ended up on the wring side of a 2=14 to 0-5 hammering, a record in championship football for Kerry. At the end of a disappointing year for Kerry overall, O'Sullivan played 5 league and 6 championship games.
2002 seen Kerry find themselves in Div 2 of the National League. O'Sullivan again missed the early part of the campaign, but was back as Kerry beat Laois to take the title by 1-09 to 1-05, with O'Sullivan playing Right corner back. He was back in the half back line as Kerry opened their Munster title defense with a hard fought win over Limerick. on a 0-14 to 1-07 scoreline. On a wet ran in Killarney a low scoring 0-08 a piece scoreline, meant the sides would have to meet again. In the replay Cork ran out winners on a 0-15 to 1-09 in a game where O'Sullivan would play his first championship game in the Kerry full back line, a line where he would for the rest of his intercounty career, when he played full back. Kerry faced into their first ever All-Ireland Qualifier game and a first game against Wicklow at championship level. For the first time in since his debut O'Sullivan would find himself on the bench, a role he would play for the rest of the year. He would play no part in what was to be a straightforward 5-15 to 0-07 win. This set up another first championship meeting for Kerry this time with Fermanagh. Another comfortable win was the result for Kerry, this time on a 2-15 to 0-04 scoreline. O'Sullivan managed to get some game time this time round coming off the bench to replace Eamonn Fitzmaurice. This set up a meeting with Kildare who had lost the Leinster final. In the first championship meeting for the sides since Kildare's surprise 98 semi final win Kerry made no mistake winning on a 2-10 to 1-05 scoreline, with O'Sullivan again coming off the bench to replace Eamonn Fitzmaurice once more. The win meant Kerry were back in Croke Park for a Q/F tie with All Ireland champions Galway. The Kingdom had too much for them and ran out comfortable winners on a 2-17 to 1-12 scoreline. O'Sullivan again appeared off the bench replacing, for the third game in a row, Eamonn Fitzmaurice. This set up a historic first championship meeting in Croke Park with old rivals Cork. After losing out in Munster Kerry made no mistake second time around and routed the Rebels on a 3-19 to 2-07 scoreline. O'Sullivan had a short stay on the field as he was sent off soon after replacing Marc Ó'Sé. This set up an All Ireland final with Armagh. Kerry looked to be in control when they led at half time but an early second half goal seen the Ulster side claim a first All Ireland on a 1-12 to 0-14 scoreline. He once again replaced Marc Ó'Sé during the game. O'Sullivan finished the year, where he largely played as a sub, playing in all but one of Kerrys 8 championship games, starting 3 and coming on as a sub for the other 5 he played in.
O'Sullivan started the 2003 season by playing in all 7 of Kerry's games, mostly in the full back line. He started his first championship games since the previous years Munster semi final loss to Cork, when he lined outed at left corner back against Tipperary, in a game Kerry ran out winners on a 0-025 to 1-10 scoreline. This set up a Munster final with Limerick, who had pulled off a shocked result with a 10 pint win over Cork in the semi-final. This would be the only season of his career where O'Sullivan wouldn't play Cork in championship football. Appearing in a first Munster final since 1991 Limerick pushed Kerry all the way, but came up short in the end on a 1-11 to 0-09 scoreline, giving O'Sullivan his third Munster medal. The result meant Kerry were back in Croke Park where they faced Roscommon in the All Ireland Q/F. Despite shipping 3 goals Kerry still did enough to run out 1-21 to 3-10 winners. This set up a semi final with Ulster champions Tyrone. Despite entering the game as favorites O'Sullivan's side were totally outclassed and they fell to a 0-13 to 0-06 loss. O'Sullivan finished the year playing at Left corner back in all 4 of Kerrys championship games.
After some disappointing losses in Croke Park over the previous three seasons, Jack O'Connor took over as manager replacing Páidí Ó Sé. O'Sullivan played in O'Connor's first game in charged, a surprise loss away to Longford in the league. He didn't appear again until the round 5 win over Westmeath, but kept his place as Kerry made the final for the first time since 1997. Kerry took on Galway in the final, and with O'Sullivan at left corner back ran out winners on a 3-11 to 1-16 scoreline, giving O'Sullivan a first National League title. O'Sullivan kept his place at left corner back as Kerry opened their Munster campaign away to Clare, Kerry came away with a retrain 2-10 to 0-09 win to set up a semi final date with Cork. In a very one-sided game in Killarney Kerry had too much for the opposition and ran out easy winners by 0-15 to 0-07. This set up, for the second year in a row, a Munster final date with Limerick. A last-gasp catch from a 45 from Darragh O Se meant the sides finished level on a 1-10 each scoreline, meaning they would have to face off once again a week later in Killarney. He was back at left corner back once again for the replay, where despite a shacking start Kerry won on a 3-10 to 2-09 scoreline, giving him a 4th Munster medal. This set up a QF clash with old foes Dublin in Croke Park. Once again lining out at Left corner back in a comfortable 1-15 to 1-08 win. For the third time in four seasons O'Sullivan and Kerry faced an Ulster side in the latter end of the championship, this time squaring up with Derry this time however Kerry end up on the rightside of a 1-17 to 1-11 scoreline. Kerry faced Mayo in the final in a first championship meeting for the sides since the 1997 final. In somewhat of a surprise Kerry ran out easy winners on a 1-20 to 2-09 scoreline, giving O'Sullivan a second All Ireland medal. O'Sullivan would finish off the year by picking up a first All Star at Left corner back. In what was to be his most successful season to date, O'Sullivan finished the year playing in all 7 of Kerry's championship games and 6 league games. He ended the year with a clean sweep of National League, Munster and All Ireland medals along with an All Star.
Kerry failed to defend their league title in 2005, just missing out on a semi final spot. O'Sullivan playing in all but one of the 7 games. Kerry kicked off the defense of their All Ireland title with a 2-22 to 0-13 Tipperary in Thurles, with O'Sullivan in his now established Corner Back slot. This set up a semi final with Lemrick, a side they had beaten in the previous two Munster finals. In another close game two Colm Cooper goals were the difference in a 2-10 to 0-10 win. The result was a first Munster final with Cork since 2001. In another close game in Cork it was a goal from Kerry captain Declan O'Sullivan that swing the tie in Kerrys favor as the game ended in a 1-10 to 0-10 win for Kerry and a first 3 in a row of Munster titles since 1996-98. The result also game O'Sullivan a 5th Munster title. In the All Ireland QF seen a repeat of the previous years All Ireland final where Kerry faced Mayo. In a much closer game then 2004 Kerry ran out winners on a 2-15 to 0-18 scoreline in what was to be a tough afternoon for O Sullivan where he was replaced by Eamonn Fitzmaurice. For the second time in 4 seasons Kerry faced off with Cork in Croke Park in the All Ireland semi final. Where only a few weeks before a single goal was between them this time around was a different story. Much like the 2002 semi final Kerry totally outclassed their rivals in a 1-19 to 0-09 hammering. This saw Kerry and O'Sullivan qualify for their 4th All Ireland final since 2000. It was a repeat of the 2003 semi final with Tyrone. In what was one of the games for the year, Tyrone once more had the upper hand and came out on top in a 1-16 to 2-10 scoreline. O'Sullivan ended his 6th season at senior level having played right corner back in all 6 of Kerry's championship games and 6 out of 7 league games.
O'Sullivan was known primarily as a corner-back, but has had to move to full-back since the retirement of Mike McCarthy. He coped very well in the early stages of the championship, being described as 'soundness personified at full back'. However, he struggled at times in the Munster final against Michael Cussen of Cork and in the All-Ireland quarter-final against Vincent Corey of Monaghan. Nevertheless, the year ended well for O'Sullivan, as Kerry beat Cork by 3-13 to 1-9 in the All-Ireland Final

Madagascar Fauna and Flora Group

The Madagascar Fauna and Flora Group (MFG) is an international consortium of zoos and other conservation agencies which pool resources to help conserve animal species in Madagascar, through captive breeding programs, field research programs, training programs for rangers and wardens, and acquisition and protection of native habitat in Madagascar. It is a non-governmental organization working in conjunction with the
Ministry of Water, Forests, and the Environment, Government of Madagascar. It is the organization behind the Save the Lemur campaign and is headquartered at the Saint Louis Zoo.
Origins.
The organization was formed in response to a plea by the Government of Madagascar to the international zoo community in 1987 to help conserve species and habitat in Madagascar and provide training and know-how for such activities. The plea was made at a meeting held at St. Catherines Island, Georgia, United States. Convened by the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Conservation Breeding Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, it was attended by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (then Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust) headed by Gerald Durrell, Parc Zoologique et Botanique de Mulhouse, the Strasborg consortium, the Duke Lemur Center, and several US zoos. These institutions became the founding members of the group when it was formalized in 1988. As of August 2021, the organization has 30 member institutions. The two logos of the organization sport two of Madagascar's oft championed species for conservation – the ruffed lemur and the aye-aye.
Goals.
The six major goals of the MFG, as outlined in their mission statement, are:
Among their campaigns is Save the Lemur, a drive to raise funds and generate awareness about the plight of lemur species in Madagascar.

British Antarctic Survey

The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) is the United Kingdom's national polar research institute. It has a dual purpose, to conduct polar science, enabling better understanding of global issues, and to provide an active presence in the Antarctic on behalf of the UK. It is part of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). With over 400 staff, BAS takes an active role in Antarctic affairs, operating five research stations, one ship and five aircraft in both polar regions, as well as addressing key global and regional issues. This involves joint research projects with over 40 UK universities and more than 120 national and international collaborations.
Having taken shape from activities during World War II, it was known as the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey until 1962.
History.
Operation Tabarin was a small British expedition in 1943 to establish permanently occupied bases in the Antarctic. It was a joint undertaking by the Admiralty and the Colonial Office. At the end of the war it was renamed the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) and full control passed to the Colonial Office. At this time there were four stations, three occupied and one unoccupied. By the time FIDS was renamed the British Antarctic Survey in 1962, 19 stations and three refuges had been established.
In 2012 the parent body, Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), proposed merging the BAS with another NERC institute, National Oceanography Centre in Southampton. This proved controversial, and after the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee opposed the move the plan was dropped. Since April 2018 NERC has been part of UK Research and Innovation.
Directors.
In 1956, the FID Scientific Bureau and FIDS Rear Base were combined into a single FIDS London Office, with a Director for the first time responsible for the whole London operation.
Research stations.
Antarctica.
The BAS operates five permanent research stations in the British Antarctic Territory:
Of these Research Stations, only Rothera is staffed throughout the year. Before 2017 Halley was also open year-round.
South Georgia.
The BAS also operates two permanent bases on South Georgia:
Both South Georgia bases are staffed throughout the year.
Other sites.
The headquarters of the BAS are in the university city of Cambridge, on Madingley Road. This facility provides offices, laboratories and workshops to support the scientific and logistic activities in the Antarctic.
The BAS also operates the Ny-Ålesund Research Station on behalf of the NERC. This is an Arctic research base located at Ny-Ålesund on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen.
Equipment.
Ships.
As of 2021, the Survey operates one ship, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, for support of Arctic and Antarctic research operations, and other logistical work. It replaced RRS James Clark Ross and RRS Ernest Shackleton, which were sold in 2021 and returned to its owners in 2019, respectively. Originally, the Admiralty provided the FIDS with ship support. In 1947 the Survey purchased their first vessel, which was named MV John Biscoe, and in 1953 the same ship was granted Royal Research Ship status. Since then the Survey has owned and chartered several vessels.
Vessels depart from the United Kingdom in September or October of each year and return to the United Kingdom in the following May or June. Vessels undergo refit and drydock during the Antarctic winter, but are also used elsewhere during this period.
The civilian ships operated by the BAS are complemented by the capabilities of the Royal Navy's ice patrol vessel that operates in the same waters. Until 2008 this was , a Class 1A1 icebreaker. "Endurance's" two Lynx helicopters enabled BAS staff to get to remote field sites that BAS aircraft could not access. However, a catastrophic flooding accident left "Endurance" badly damaged, with a replacement only being procured in 2011. This ship, , first deployed to the Antarctic in November 2011.
Aircraft.
BAS operates five aircraft in support of its research programme in Antarctica. The aircraft used are all made by de Havilland Canada and comprise four Twin Otters and one Dash 7 (as of August 2019). The planes are maintained by Rocky Mountain Aircraft in Springbank, Alberta, Canada. During the Antarctic summer the aircraft are based at the Rothera base, which has a 900-metre gravel runway. During the Antarctic winter, conditions preclude flying and the aircraft return to Canada.
The larger Dash 7 undertakes regular shuttle flights between either Port Stanley Airport on the Falkland Islands, or Punta Arenas in Chile, and Rothera. It also operates to and from the ice runway at the Sky Blu base. The smaller Twin Otters are equipped with skis for landing on snow and ice in remote areas, and operate out of the bases at Rothera, Fossil Bluff, Halley and Sky Blu.
Findings.
In 1985, the British Antarctic Survey discovered the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica. The finding was made by a team of three BAS scientists: Joe Farman, Brian Gardiner and Jonathan Shanklin. Their work was confirmed by satellite data, and was met with worldwide concern.
In January 2008, a team of British Antarctic Survey scientists, led by Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, reported that 2,200 years ago, a volcano erupted under Antarctica's ice sheet (based on airborne survey with radar images). The biggest eruption in the last 10,000 years, the volcanic ash was found deposited on the ice surface under the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.
In 2020, a team reported that emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica were nearly 20% more numerous than previously thought, with new discoveries made using satellite mapping technology.
Polar image collection.
The BAS runs an online polar image collection which includes imagery of scientific research at the poles, logistics operations, and the continent and its The image collection is run by British cameraman and photographer Pete Bucktrout, who has visited the continent eleven times during his 24 years working for BAS. His work has been seen in newspapers and on television around the world.

Virginia State Route 49

State Route 49 (SR 49) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs from the North Carolina state line in Virgilina, Virginia in Halifax County, where the highway continues south as North Carolina Highway 49 (NC 49), north to U.S. Route 360 (US 360) near Burkeville in Nottoway County. SR 49 passes through Southside Virginia, connecting Virgilina and Burkeville with Clarksville and Chase City in Mecklenburg County, Victoria in Lunenburg County, and Crewe in Nottoway County. Via US 360, the state highway connects Richmond with the John H. Kerr Reservoir.
Route description.
SR 49 begins at the North Carolina state line in the town of Virgilina in southeastern Halifax County. The state highway is concurrent with SR 96 on two-lane undivided Florence Avenue. The two highways continue into North Carolina as NC 49 and NC 96, which then split and head toward Roxboro and Oxford, respectively. The two highways cross over the old railroad grade of the Norfolk, Franklin and Danville Railway then intersect Seventh Street. SR 96 turns west toward US 501, which leads to South Boston and Halifax, the county seat of Halifax County. SR 49 turns east onto Seventh Street, leaving the town and becoming Clarksville Road, which closely parallels the state line for a short distance before veering northeast and entering Mecklenburg County after crossing Aarons Creek, which flows north into the Dan River. The state highway passes through the hamlets of Nelson and Buffalo Junction before reaching US 58.
SR 49 joins US 58, a four-lane divided highway, in a concurrency to just west of Clarksville. SR 49 heads northeast along Virginia Avenue, which also carried US 58 prior to the completion of US 58's Clarksville bypass. Virginia Avenue is a four-lane divided highway from US 58 into the town of Clarksville until just after it passes under the Virginia Southern Railroad, where the highway reduces to a two-lane undivided road and intersects US 15 (College Avenue). SR 49 and US 15 continue east concurrent into downtown Clarksville, where the highway passes through the Clarksville Historic District. After passing through the downtown area, SR 49 and US 15 leave the town of Clarksville by crossing the John H. Kerr Reservoir, an impoundment of the Roanoke River that is also known as Buggs Island Lake, on the Phillip Saint Julian Wilson Bridge and a causeway. The bridge, which contains lights underneath used for nighttime fishing, includes a brief passage through Halifax County due to the thalwegs of the Roanoke and Dan Rivers, which were used to set the county boundaries, converging just south of Clarksville. At the east end of the causeway, access to US 58 is provided at a four-way intersection. Ramps to US 58 west and US 58 east form the southern and eastern legs of the intersection, which mainline US 58 avoids via a pair of flyover ramps just east of its bridge over the reservoir. SR 49 and US 15 turn north, cross over the Virginia Southern rail line, and parallel the eastern shore of the lake until the two highways split at the hamlet of Dortch Store.
SR 49 heads northeast, crossing Goodell Creek, Little Bluestone Creek, and Woodpecker Creek and passing through the hamlet of Jones Store before reaching Chase City. Just inside the town limits, SR 49 joins SR 92 in a concurrency on Second Street while crossing Little Bluestone Creek again. In the center of town, the two highways cross over the Virginia Southern rail line and intersect Main Street. SR 92 heads south toward Boydton on Main Street, SR 47 heads east on Second Street toward South Hill, and SR 49 turns north onto Main Street to join SR 47 in a concurrency. At the north end of town, SR 47 splits to the northwest while SR 49 veers northeast, where the highway crosses the Meherrin River on the Tucker Mill Bridge into Lunenburg County. The state highway gains the name Courthouse Road, which it carries as it bridges the Middle Meherrin River and North Meherrin River and passes through the county seat of Lunenburg, where SR 40 (Lunenburg County Road) joins the highway in a concurrency northeast to the town of Victoria. SR 49 and SR 40 enter the town as Court Street, crossing the former right-of-way of the Norfolk, Franklin and Danville Railway before reaching Main Street. SR 40 turns south toward Kenbridge while SR 49 turns north then veers northeast onto Nottoway Boulevard.
SR 49 leaves Victoria as The Falls Road, named for the cataract where the state highway crosses the Nottoway River into Nottoway County. The state highway is also named Earle Davis Gregory Highway, named for Earle Davis Gregory, a World War I Medal of Honor recipient. At the river, SR 49 turns north, crossing Whetstone Creek and the Little Nottoway River before reaching the town of Crewe. The state highway crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway's Norfolk District just east of a rail yard. SR 49 turns northwest onto Virginia Avenue, where the highway joins US 460 in a concurrency. The two highways become West Virginia Avenue outside of the downtown area and parallel the rail yard to the west end of town, where SR 49 turns north onto Watsons Wood Road. SR 49 crosses Deep Creek before reaching its northern terminus at US 360 (Patrick Henry Highway) northeast of Burkeville.
History.
Prior to 1940, SR 49 continued west from Virgilina to US 501 and north from Burkeville all the way to Flint Hill. Most of SR 49 north of Burkeville became US 522 in the 1940 renumbering.
SR 49 Truck.
Virginia State Truck Route 49 in Victoria, Virginia starts out overlapped with Virginia State Route 40 Truck, following Tidewater Avenue from Court Street to West 6th Street, Railroad Avenue from Tidewater Avenue and West 6th Street to Main Street, and First Avenue. From there it turns north onto Main Street in another overlap, this time with Virginia State Route 40, and terminates at the east end of the VA 40/49 overlap.

Willys Jeep Station Wagon

The Willys Jeep Station Wagon, Jeep Utility Wagon and Jeep Panel Delivery are automobiles produced by Willys and Kaiser Jeep in the United States from 1946 to 1964, with production in Argentina and Brazil continuing until 1970 and 1977, respectively. They were the first mass-market all-steel station wagons designed and built as a passenger vehicle. With over 300,000 wagons and its variants built in the U.S., it was one of Willys' most successful post-World War II models. For some time after the 1949 introduction of a four-wheel drive option, the 2WD was sold as "Station Wagon", while the 4WD was marketed as "Utility Wagon". The 4WD Willys Jeep Wagon is often considered the first production sport utility vehicle. The Jeep Wagon was assembled in several international markets under various forms of joint ventures, licenses, or knock-down kits.
Development and reception.
The Jeep Wagon was designed in the mid-1940s by industrial designer Brooks Stevens. Willys did not make their own bodies, car bodies were in high demand, and Willys was known to have limited finances. Brooks therefore designed bodies that could be built by sheet metal fabricators who normally made parts for household appliances and could draw sheet metal no more than . 
The steel body was efficient to mass-produce, easier to maintain and safer than the real wood-bodied station wagon versions at the time. Within the first two years of the Jeep Wagon's production, the only manufacturer in the United States with a station wagon that was comparable in price was Crosley, which introduced an all-steel wagon in 1947.
The Jeep Wagon was the first Willys product with independent front suspension. Barney Roos, Willys' chief engineer, developed a system based on a transverse seven-leaf spring. The system, called "Planadyne" by Willys, was similar in concept to the "planar" suspension Roos had developed for Studebaker in the mid-1930s.
In 1953 the U.S. military included the 4x4 station wagon models 463 and 473 as non (standard) classified 1/4-ton trucks under Standard Nomenclature List number G-740 in Technical Manual edition TM9-2800-1.
Production timeline.
Argentina.
The Jeep Wagon was produced as the IKA Estanciera by Industrias Kaiser Argentina from 1957 to 1970.
Brazil.
In the 1950s, a version based on the 1946 US version was introduced. A truck version, the Pickup, was introduced in 1961. Ford Brazil bought the Willys factory in 1967 and the Rural Jeep wagon was renamed Ford Rural, and the truck was later named the Ford F-75 in 1972. Both models were offered with an inline-six engine, which was the first gasoline engine manufactured in Brazil. They were available in RWD or 4X4 configuration. The Rural was discontinued in 1977 and the F-75 in 1981.

Saturn AL-31

The Saturn AL-31 (originally Lyulka) is a family of axial flow turbofan engines, developed by the Lyulka-Saturn design bureau in the Soviet Union, now NPO Saturn in Russia, originally as a 12.5-tonne (122.6 kN, 27,560 lbf) powerplant for the Sukhoi Su-27 long range air superiority fighter. The AL-31 currently powers the Su-27 family of combat aircraft and some variants of the Chengdu J-10 multirole jet fighter. Assembly of the engine is also performed under license in India by HAL, for the Sukhoi Su-30MKI. Improved variants power the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 and Chengdu J-20.
Development and design.
The design of the AL-31 turbofan began in the 1970s under the designation "izdeliye" 99 by the Lyulka design bureau, also known as Lyulka-Saturn. With an emphasis on greater fuel efficiency over turbojets for longer range, the class turbofan engine was intended to power the heavy PFI (, ), which was being developed by Sukhoi as the T-10. The chief designer was Arkhip M. Lyulka, and after his death, Victor M. Chepkin. As the AL-31 was not yet ready for the first two T-10 prototypes in 1977, they were initially powered by modified AL-21F3 turbojet engines. The third prototype would be the first to install the AL-31. The T-10 design would be heavily revised into the T-10S, with T-10-7 being the first prototype of the improved design; the aircraft's aerodynamic refinements from changes in the outer shaping and packaging also resulted in the AL-31 gearbox changing to a top-mounted position. State tests of the AL-31 were completed in 1985, and the T-10 entering Soviet air services as the Su-27. The engine is manufactured at Ufa-based UMPO and Moscow-based Salyut.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, design bureau and production plant distinctions realigned and gradually faded, and Lyulka-Saturn eventually merged with Rybinsk Motors to become NPO Saturn and was closely aligned with UMPO while Salyut became an independent entity; both Saturn and Salyut would make their own developments for the AL-31 family. Salyut also supplies AL-31 variants to fighters operated by the China. The J-10 uses the AL-31FN before newer variants transitioned to the domestic WS-10A, while the J-20 uses the AL-31FM2 as an interim engine until its intended WS-15 is ready. This reorganization would result in serious disputes between Saturn and Salyut over intellectual property rights and royalties over AL-31 sales to China.
The AL-31 was also used to assist Chinese engine designer and manufacturer Shenyang/Liming in developing the WS-10, with early examples directly using the AL-31F control system. According to Saturn's Victor M. Chepkin, chief designer of the 117 and 117S engines, the WS-10 was developed with the aid of the AL-31's maintenance technical documentation; this was recently confirmed by Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), the parent of Shenyang Aircraft Corporation.
Design.
The base model AL-31F is a two-shaft axial-flow afterburning turbofan. The engine has a four-stage low-pressure compressor and a nine-stage high-pressure compressor, both driven by single stage turbines. Overall pressure ratio is 23, and the turbine inlet temperature is ; the turbine blades incorporate air film cooling. The engine is controlled by the analogue KRD-99 unit, and can tolerate severely distorted air flow from the intake. It produces of thrust dry and of thrust in afterburner. The AL-31 has a modular design to facilitate maintenance and overhaul. In the twin-engine Su-27, left and right engines are interchangeable. Initially, the Mean Time Between Overhaul (MTBO) of the engine was only 100 hours, short of the required 300 hours. Later series incrementally improved the MTBO figure to 500 hours while service life was assigned as 1,500 hours. Further improved variants, such as the AL-31F Series 42, increased the MTBO to 1,000 hours with a full-life of 2,000 hours.
Further developments.
Thrust vectoring.
The AL-37FU and AL-31FP variants have thrust vectoring. The AL-37FU was an experimental thrust vectoring variant for a modified Su-27M, later designated Su-37, and was uprated to of thrust. The thrust vectoring nozzles could deflect ±15° in the vertical plane together for pitch or differentially for roll. After the engines reached the end of their service lives, the sole Su-37 was equipped with the normal AL-31F until it crashed in December 2002.
The research on thrust vectoring would be applied to the production AL-31FP used in the Sukhoi/Irkut Su-30MKI for India as well as further derivatives including the Su-30MKM for Malaysia and the Su-30SM for the Russian Air Force and Navy. The AL-31FP has the same thrust of as the baseline AL-31F, but can deflect its nozzle to a maximum of ±15° at a rate of 30°/sec. The vectoring nozzle is used primarily in the pitch plane, but unlike the AL-37FU, the canting of the vectoring axes allow differential vectoring to produce roll and yaw moments as well. The AL-31FP nozzle has a time before overhaul of 500 hours, while the engine's MTBO is 1,000 hours, and both have a service life of 2,000 hours. AL-31FP is built by UMPO as well as in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) at the Koraput facility under a deep technology transfer agreement.
Salyut developments.
AL-31FN.
The AL-31FN variant was developed by Salyut to power the Chengdu J-10, with key differences including slightly more thrust of and gearbox relocated from the top to the bottom of the engine. Later J-10 variants and production lots were equipped with the improved AL-31FN series 3, with thrust increased to and service life raised by 250 hours. Further production J-10 batches would eventually be equipped with the Shenyang/Liming WS-10A in lieu of the AL-31FN.
During the 2024 Zhuhai Air Show, Rostec introduced the Series 5 upgrade of the AL-31FN, having a theoretical thrust of and a 6% enhancement in fuel consumption.
AL-31FM1, FM2, and FM3.
Salyut also developed additional improved variants of the AL-31F with increased thrust and reliability. The first is the AL-31FM1, also designated as the AL-31F series 42, which had a larger KND-924-4 fan, with inlet diameter increasing from on the baseline AL-31 to which increased airflow by 6%. Additional enhancements include an improved core for greater turbine inlet temperature, and improved engine control system. The engine also had improved MTBO of 1,000 hours, projected life of 2,000 hours, and its thrust was increased to ; this engine passed Russian state acceptance testing in 2006 and was equipped on the Su-27SM, Su-30M2, and Su-34.
The AL-31FM2 is a further development of the AL-31FM1. Fan aerodynamics was further refined to increase its pressure ratio. The engine also incorporated improvements to the combustor and turbine blade aerodynamics and cooling for higher entry temperatures. The AL-31FM2 has a new full authority digital engine control (FADEC) with a hydromechanical backup. Thrust was increased 9% across the envelope, with a maximum thrust of in afterburner. The engine has an MTBO of 1,000 hours and projected life increased to 3,000 hours. A version of the AL-31FM2 powers initial production batches of the Chengdu J-20 while later batches transitioned to the WS-10C; both of these engines are interim powerplants in place of the J-20's intended Xian WS-15.
The last in this line is the proposed AL-31FM3, which would have a new 3-stage fan, designated KND-924-3, with further increased pressure ratio and additional core improvements to increase turbine inlet temperature by 150 °C. Maximum thrust was increased to in afterburner. The AL-31FM3 had been proposed as a potential powerplant for Sukhoi's T-50 PAK FA design but this was not pursued by Sukhoi, which instead chose Salyut rival NPO Saturn and its AL-41F1.
Salyut's developments of the AL-31 would result in serious disputes with Lyulka-Saturn's successor corporation NPO Saturn, which considers them unsanctioned and in violation of intellectual property rights.
Saturn developments.
AL-41F-1 ("izdeliye" 117).
Due to the decline of the Mikoyan Project 1.42/1.44 MFI fifth-generation fighter program in the 1990s, the Russian Defence Ministry initiated the PAK FA program for a more affordable next-generation multirole fighter, with the competition announced in 2001. As the designs would be smaller than the MFI, the original Lyulka-Saturn AL-41F design for the MiG 1.42/1.44 was too large. Instead, a deeply improved AL-31F derivative from Lyulka-Saturn (later NPO Saturn) designated the "izdeliye" 117 was contracted by Sukhoi for its T-50 design, which would eventually win the competition in 2002 and enter service in 2020 as the Su-57. First proposed by Saturn in 2001, the "izdeliye" 117, or AL-41F1, formally began development in April 2004 with contract signing by NPO Saturn.
While the AL-41F1 has the same overall architecture as the baseline AL-31, with a 4-stage low-pressure compressor (fan) and 9-stage high-pressure compressor and one-stage low pressure and one-stage high pressure turbines, the engine was deeply improved with up to 80% new parts and application of technology from the AL-41F. It has increased fan diameter of , new high- and low-pressure turbines, provisions for thrust-vectoring nozzles similar to the AL-31FP, and a digital control system (FADEC) integrated into the aircraft's flight control system. Though the specifics remain classified, the AL-41F1's thrust was increased by over the AL-31 while the engine weight growth was reduced by . The engine produces of thrust dry, in afterburner, and in an emergency, with a dry weight of approximately . The engine enables the Su-57 to achieve supersonic speed without afterburner, or supercruise, at Mach 1.3.
Following completion of state tests to meet Russian Air Force requirements, serial production of the AL-41F1 began in 2019 for installation in production Su-57 fighters supplied to the Russian Air Force and prospective foreign clients. A non-afterburning version of the AL-41F1 powers the Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV). While the current Su-57 production tranches are powered by the AL-41F1, the aircraft is to be the basis for a family of stealth combat aircraft; future improved variants are planned to be powered by the Saturn "izdeliye" 30, later designated AL-51F-1, a new design that fits into the same footprint as the AL-41F1.
AL-41F-1S ("izdeliye" 117S).
To spread out development risks and associated costs with the fifth-generation PAK FA program, Sukhoi applied some of the technology, including the propulsion system, into a highly upgraded Su-27 variant, designated T-10BM (popularly called the Su-35BM), before being designated just as the Su-35. The aircraft's powerplant, the NPO Saturn "izdeliye" 117S, or AL-41F1S, is a slightly simplified derivative of the AL-41F1 from the Su-57, with the key difference being the separate engine control system of the AL-41F1S. The Su-35 and its AL-41F1S engines were originally developed by Sukhoi and Saturn internally for export, although the initial customer would be the Russia Defence Ministry. The engine produces of thrust dry, in afterburner, and in an emergency. The AL-41F1S fan diameter was increased by 3% over the baseline AL-31, from to , and also has increased turbine inlet temperature. This engine weighs dry and has an assigned life of 4,000 hours and an MTBO of 1,000 to 1,500 hours. The first flight of this engine was completed in an Su-35BM on 20 February 2008. On 9 August 2010, UMPO started supplying AL-41F1S intended for Su-35S fighters. The engine is also equipped on the Su-30SM2 as part of the upgrade plan to unify its systems with the Su-35S.
During the 2024 Zhuhai Airshow, United Engine Corporation showcased the engine with a new serrated nozzle under the "117S" generic designation.

Seamus Moynihan

Séamus Moynihan is an Irish former Gaelic footballer from Shronedarraugh, a townland halfway between Barraduff and Glenflesk, County Kerry. He has played football for St Brendan's College, Glenflesk, East Kerry, University College Cork, Institute of Technology Tralee, Kerry Minor, U21 and Senior teams, Munster Railway Cup side and the Ireland international rules football team. He was a member of the Kerry Senior Football Panel from 1992 to 2006. He resides in Shronedarraugh with his wife Noreen, son Jamie and two daughters Clíona and Eve.
Early life.
As an underage player, Moynihan idolised the style of Kerry All-Star forward John Egan and played for his local GAA club Glenflesk, secondary school team St Brendan's College, Killarney, and Kerry Minors and U21s. Moynihan's first inter-county success arrived at the age of 16 when he was part of the Kerry Minor team that claimed the Munster crown in 1990. 1992 was a pivotal year for Moynihan, when he lined out for the St Brendan's team that beat St Jarlath's College of Tuam to win the Hogan Cup in the All-Ireland Colleges Final and was also noticed on the Kerry U21 team that won out in Munster. It was about this time that Mickey 'Ned' O'Sullivan, former Kerry captain and later manager of the Limerick senior football team, began to talk to people about Moynihan's potential. Séamus Moynihan, aged just 18, made his senior debut at midfield for Kerry in the Munster Final, replacing Gneeveguilla veteran Ambrose O'Donovan. Playing alongside the likes of Kerry forward Eoin 'Bomber' Liston and midfield colossus Jack O'Shea, Kerry lost to a steely Clare side on a score of 2–10 to 0–12. It was O'Sullivan's last game in charge of the Kerry senior side.
Formative career: 1992–1996.
During the 1992 and 1993 campaigns, Moynihan was tried at half back, midfield and half forward before settling into the half back line. The next 3 championship seasons were unsettling from a Kerry viewpoint as 3 straight defeats by Cork in the 1993, 1994 and 1995 Munster Finals saw the Kerry seniors eyeballing a 10-year low. Despite this disappointing level of achievement at inter-county level, Séamus Moynihan was beginning a strong run of success at Sigerson Cup level, playing for U.C.C. in the 1994 and 1995 finals; then returning 2 years later in 1997 and 1998 whilst studying for a master's degree at IT Tralee to collect more winner's medals.
Retirement and plaudits.
Moynihan announced his retirement from inter-county football on Saturday, 23 September 2006 through an article in The Irish Times. On the following Monday, Kerry team manager Jack O'Connor hailed Moynihan as "a one-off player" and said Kerry football would never see his like again. He also stated that Séamus was an inspiration to the entire Kerry team, particularly the younger players and that he would be missed. Announcing his decision to quit lining out for Kerry, Moynihan said: "All good things come to an end."
On 18 December 2011, Séamus announced his retirement from club football after over 20 years of service for the Glenflesk senior football team.
Honours.
Moynihan won four All-Ireland medals, three National Leagues, nine Munster championship medals, four Sigerson Cup medals, three GAA All-Stars, one Railway Cup medal and one Division 2 title. He also won three county championship medals with East Kerry and captained his country in the International Rules series.
In May 2020, a public poll conducted by RTÉ.ie named Moynihan in the full-back line alongside Páidi and Marc Ó Sé in a team of footballers who had won All Stars during the era of "The Sunday Game".
Also in May 2020, the "Irish Independent" named Moynihan at number fifteen in its "Top 20 footballers in Ireland over the past 50 years".

Moreton Corbet Castle

Moreton Corbet Castle is a ruined medieval castle and Elizabethan era manor house, located near the village of Moreton Corbet, Shropshire, England. It is a Grade I listed building and English Heritage property. Although out of use since the 18th century, it remains the property of the Corbet family. It can be visited free of charge during daylight hours.
History.
Medieval stronghold.
In 1086 two Anglo Saxon thegns, Hunning and Wulfgeat, were living at Moreton Corbet. By the early thirteenth century the structure had been replaced by another, built by Toret, an Englishman. His descendant Peter Toret was lord of Moreton Corbet by 1166 and it is likely that he was living in the castle. In February 1216 William Marshall stormed Moreton Corbet castle on behalf of King John of England against Bartholomew Toret. At this time the castle was known as Moreton Toret Castle. In 1235 Bartholomew died and Richard de Corbet, his son-in-law, inherited the castle and changed its name to Moreton Corbet.
The keep or great tower to the west was connected to the gatehouse by a curtain wall, which then curved south and looped to encircle the site, creating a bailey or courtyard. The roof of the gatehouse has not survived, but the corbel work that supported the roof and tower battlements of the castle is still extant.
At the western end of the extant curtain wall is a rectangular keep of two stories and a basement, dating from between the eleventh and early thirteenth centuries. It was entered through an elevated doorway, and the fireplaces on the lower residential floor are still visible.
Elizabethan house.
In the 16th century, Sir Andrew Corbet filled the courtyard to the east of the keep with a new house, stretching in a straight line to the south and west of the medieval structure. The perimeter wall to the west and south of the tower is now almost completely removed, leaving a gap between the castle and the later house.
Corbet adapted the medieval gatehouse with a gothic arch. In 1579, a year after Corbet had died, a carving of his monogram and the year were added, surmounting another rectangular stone bearing the family crest of an elephant and castle in relief.
Corbet had a large domestic range built against the curtain wall, with kitchens below and accommodation above. East and south of the gatehouse, the domestic ranges opened into a great hall. A large fireplace is apparent on the first floor, with a smaller one on the lower floor. Doorways were made through the curtain wall to the latrines. The keep was converted into a storehouse.
South of the castle, Corbet's son Robert had a wide but shallow house built in a more modern style, described by the noted antiquarian William Camden (1551–1623) as "a most gorgeous and stately house after the Italian model." It seems to have been influenced by the classical architecture of Italian buildings that he saw on his diplomatic travels, including Palladio's Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza. The building was faced with stone, but internally the walls were of brick. Although Italian in inspiration and elaborately decorated, much of the carving was of a rustic finish. After Robert Corbet died of the plague in 1583, his brothers Richard and Vincent Corbet carried on with the building of the new manor, leaving what was left of the original fortification.
Civil War.
During the English Civil War, Moreton Castle was used as part of Royalist Shrewsbury's defence. The castle was under siege on more than one occasion, and badly damaged in the fighting. The surviving ruins of the walls are pock-marked from musket shot. It was captured by a small Parliamentarian force in a night attack in September 1644, which deceived the Royalist garrison force into surrendering, believing the Parliamentarian force to be much larger.

Child's Play (play)

Child's Play is a stage play written by Robert Marasco. It opened on Broadway on 12 February 1970 at the Royale Theatre and ran for 342 performances, closing on 12 December. The play was produced by David Merrick and directed by Joseph Hardy, with settings by Jo Mielziner. The leading roles were taken by Pat Hingle, Fritz Weaver and Ken Howard. 
Marasco's only produced play, he initially wrote the script in 1966 under the title "The Dark". The atmosphere of the play, although not the plot, was derived from Marasco's experiences as a teacher of Latin and Greek at Regis High School, a highly regarded Jesuit school in Manhattan.
The play was presented in London's West End in 1971, opening at the Queen's Theatre on 16 March. As on Broadway, the director and designer were, respectively, Hardy and Mielziner, with Laurence Harvey, Rupert Davies and Derek Fowlds in the cast. 
In 1972, Sidney Lumet directed a screen adaptation under the same title, starring James Mason, Robert Preston and Beau Bridges.
Synopsis.
The play centers on the rivalry between two faculty members at St. Charles, an exclusive Roman Catholic boarding school for boys. Joe Dobbs is an easy-going, well-liked English teacher, while Latin and Greek instructor Jerome Malley is feared and hated by his students for his strict disciplinary methods. Malley is caring for his dying mother, and his stress is exacerbated by a series of threatening phone calls and written notes he receives. He is certain Dobbs is the source, but his caustic personality prevents him from winning any sympathy or support. Into the fray comes Paul Reese, a former student who has been hired to teach PE, and he soon finds his loyalty torn between the friendly Dobbs and Malley, as he becomes increasingly aware of the latter's personal torments. Compounding his situation is the realization that the unbridled violence practiced by the students may be the result of demonic possession.
Plot.
Joe Dobbs is speaking to McArdle, one of his students, who was caught calling Jerome Malley in the middle of the night and who is trying to get Dobbs to intervene on his behalf. Dobbs makes no promises to McArdle and the latter heads to the headmaster for a meeting. Paul Reese, an alumnus of the school, now teaching history and PE, leaves the faculty room to act as a referee for a basketball game played by the boys. As Reese is heading toward the gym, he runs into Fr. Griffin, who tells him to keep an eye on the boys because they have been having disciplinary issues lately. 
Back in the faculty room, Dobbs confronts Reese about McArdle and implores him to go easy on him. After Malley leaves, Fr. Griffin asks Dobbs to see if he can understand why the boys have been violent (as they have had more fights and injuries in the past few weeks than ever) since he and the headmaster can't seem to get anything out of the students. They are hoping that Dobbs, the "grand old man" of the faculty, can get the students to cooperate. Fr. Griffin leaves to patrol the halls when Malley returns, and Malley and Dobbs talk about McArdle's punishment, which is an indefinite suspension. During this conversation, Malley says all the students hate him because Dobbs is setting them against him, a charge which Dobbs vehemently denies. It is at this time that Reese comes running into the room carrying a bloody Freddy Banks and screaming for help.
A couple of hours later, Dobbs and Fr. Griffin return from the hospital and meet with Reese and Fr. Mozian, the headmaster. As a result of the incident, Freddy loses his eye, and his mother takes him out of the school, accusing the administration of being negligent in their duties. Fr. Mozian and Fr. Griffin interrogate Reese on what happened: Reese claims that the boys got in a circle around Freddy while playing dodgeball and one of them threw the ball full force at Freddy from close range. 
Freddy did nothing to protect himself; then the boys started to beat up Freddy, and once again Freddy did nothing to protect himself. Reese claims that the seniors tried to hold him and that he had to actually fight his way to Freddy, and that Freddy actually tried to get away from him. After the meeting, Fr. Mozian confronts Malley about his strict methods, imploring him to lighten up on the boys. As proof of how much the students hate him, Fr. Mozian shows Malley an unflattering note that he caught students passing in class about Malley, who claims Dobbs wrote the note and that he is manipulating everybody in the school against him.
After the meeting, Dobbs goes to the school chapel to pray for the boys. Several minutes later, Malley follows to pray for his sick and dying mother. Once again Dobbs and Malley talk. Malley accuses Dobbs of calling his mother every night and telling her terrible lies about Malley, and he begs Dobbs to stop for his mother's sake to ease her passing. Dobbs once again denies the charges and leaves the chapel. 
Malley follows several minutes later. During this time the students arrive near the chapel. Once the chapel is empty, McArdle, Wilson, Carre, and Banks carry a bleeding Travis into the chapel and tie him onto the cross. They flee. Fr. Griffin and Fr. Mozian enter a few moments later and discover Travis. They take him down from the cross, and the headmaster orders the chapel closed until further notice.
The next morning word comes down from the headmaster's office that the chapel is closed, all extracurricular activities are canceled, and the gym is off-limits except for gym class. Reese and Malley talk when Fr. Griffin and Dobbs go to class, and Reese realizes that he was wrong about Malley all along — not only was he a good teacher, but he was not as mean as they thought he was. Malley admits that he can be too hard on the students at times, but he says that's just the way he is. During this conversation, Malley gets a phone call from his mother's nurse informing him of his mother's death.
Several days later, Reese leaves a faculty meeting as a result of the rest of the faculty's attempts to put all the blame on Malley for the violence and unrest of the past several weeks. A drunk Fr. Penny talks to him about the boys, telling Reese that he's had a revelation that the boys are clearly possessed. After Fr. Penny goes to bed, Reese gets the urge to deliberately cut his hand on a piece of glass. Dobbs comes storming out of the meeting and talks with Reese while patching up his hand. Reese shows his displeasure that the administration has elected Malley as their scapegoat, and says, much to Dobbs's confusion, that there is something else in the school scaring him, even though Malley hasn't been at school in three days. During this conversation, a beaten-up Carre is thrown off the balcony in the faculty room, down the stairs, to Reese's and Dobbs's shock. 
Malley returns to work only to find that he has been fired because inappropriate mail addressed to him was discovered at the school. Malley claims once again that Dobbs has been sending him these letters in an attempt to break him. Fr. Mozian doesn't believe any of this and storms out of the room after officially terminating Malley's contract at the school. Reese comes in and tries to calm Malley. Malley tells Reese how Dobbs has been trying to destroy him, much to Reese's surprise. Dobbs comes into the room and tells Malley that he no longer belongs there. 
Reese confronts Dobbs about the accusations, and once again Dobbs denies them. After these last denials, Malley attempts to go after Dobbs, but Reese restrains him. At this, Malley rushes up the stairs and throws himself out the window. Reese tries to run to save Malley, but Dobbs tries to stop him. Reese hits Dobbs to get free, but it is too late to save Malley.
After Malley's death, the school is immediately closed. Reese returns to the faculty room to pack his things and leave. Dobbs comes in several minutes later, and Reese once again confronts him. Dobbs says how he walked a long way looking for help, but couldn't find any at the church he went into to make his confession. When Dobbs's students enter the faculty room, Dobbs admits that he did in fact torment Malley to get him out of his life, and that he didn't mean for Malley to kill himself. Dobbs orders Reese to leave so that he can make his confession to the boys. When Reese leaves, Dobbs frantically pleads for mercy from the boys as they surround him. The lights go dark for the last time in the show as the first punch is thrown at Dobbs.

Views.
Dan Wetzel is a passionate opponent of the BCS system for determining the NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship. He regularly writes on the desirability of a playoff to determine the national champion, and has co-authored a book entitled "Death to the BCS".
On March 18, 2013, Wetzel authored a series of articles on the Steubenville High School rape verdict that quickly went viral. That included a final article on the sentencing of two teenage boys. It differed starkly in tone from other coverage of the case, eschewing sympathy for the rapists' "ruined lives" and instead emphasizing the pervasive rape culture that permitted the rape to go forward, including the potential culpability of witnesses to the rape. Numerous media outlets and advocates for the prevention of sexual assault advocated that Wetzel's coverage should win awards "for going beyond the obvious ... victim-blaming." Poynter called it an example of "exactly the kind of reporting we need more of."
Criticism.
On February 22, 2014 Dan Wetzel posted an article on Yahoo entitled: "Deal with it, South Korea". The article was criticized in South Korea for affirming the result of the ladies' singles figure skating event at the XXII Olympic Winter Games, a result that the South Korean Olympic Committee formally protested.

FX-05 Xiuhcoatl

The FX-05 "Xiuhcoatl" ("Fire Serpent", literally "Turquoise-Serpent" in Classical Nahuatl,) is a Mexican assault rifle, designed and built by the "Dirección General de Industria Militar del Ejército" (General Directorate of Military Industry of the Army) through the Fabricas Militares (Military Factory). The rifle was officially presented in the military parade on September 16, 2006, in the hands of the Special Forces Airmobile Group, GAFE ("Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales"). 
The design was coordinated by the "Centro de Investigación Aplicada y Desarrollo Tecnológico de la Industria Militar" or CIADTIM (Center of Applied Research and Technology Development Military Industry) and SEDENA and all of its parts are built in Mexico. According to the director of the "DGIM", Otilio Ramírez Serrano, by July 2019 approximately 155,000 rifles have been produced. 
The FX-05 is distributed among the Mexican Armed Forces, and the military industry is aiming to produce 30,000 per year.
Development.
The development of the FX-05 began as a 16-month research in 2005 with CIADTIM as part of research efforts to replace the HK G3A3 rifles that were in service with the Mexican military. Originally the HK G36 was supposed to become the Mexican military's standard rifle as plans were already drawn to transfer technology and equipment to Mexico to initially build 30,000 rifles at a cost of €63,016,125 as part of Mexico's military modernization program. The Mexican government ultimately decided that they wanted a more cost effective alternative to the G36, which resulted in the decision to end the project before any technology or equipment could be transferred and the FX-05 project was undertaken. 
A Mexican report states that up to December 2006, $84,000,000 Mexican Pesos (€5,855,698 at the December 2006 exchange rate) were invested in the FX-05 project, including raw materials and using only national equipment and technology. Leading the FX-05 project was General Alfredo Oropeza Garnica with Brigadier General Jose Antonio Landeros. In 2015, it was revealed that due to budget cuts, SEDENA would not be able to meet the production rate of 121,000 FX-05s by 2018.
On September 16, 2016, the Mexican military unveiled a new variant of the FX-05 known as the Xihucóatl Submachine Gun alongside an indigenous underbarrel grenade launcher made for it.
On April 2, 2019, a new variant known as the PAX-100 is due to begin production.
Design details.
The design of the weapon is compatible with telescopic, red-dot and mechanical sights and has a folding, adjustable butt stock. The barrel is hammer forged, and the weapon is capable of semi-automatic, three round burst and full auto fire. It has a cyclic rate of fire of 750 rounds per minute. Most of the rifle's receiver is constructed of a polymer reinforced with carbon-fiber with an underlying titanium frame and comes in black, dark-green and desert-tan colors as well as the SEDENA digital camouflage patterns used by the Mexican army. The charging handle can be installed on either side of the rifle with gas piston located above the barrel, which operates under a multi-lugged rotary bolt system. Safety/fire mode selectors are located above the pistol grip on both sides of the FX-05. It can accept NATO-standard as well as specific transparent magazines. In 2017, it was announced that a Mexican-made grip pod was in development.
The internal mechanism and barrel are made of advanced corrosion-resistant stainless steel. An indigenous programmable air-burst grenade launcher is currently under development for the FX-05, which will be able to fire standard NATO munitions in addition to Mexico's new RSE-7 fuel-air grenade round. The FX-05 is also compatible with the AG36 grenade launcher as used on the G36, which is in use until the proprietary design is finalized. In 2017, a Mexican-made UBGL was also demonstrated.
The FX-05 is one of the world's few assault rifles featuring polygonal rifling, which eliminates the normal grooves of a weapons barrel replacing them with a system of "hills and valleys" in a rounded polygonal pattern. The optical sight is an integrated one with a carry handle attached as standard.
There has been some criticism that the barrel has reliability issues and a short operating life, blamed on low-quality materials.
The FX-05 is available in several configurations optimized for differing use, including: assault rifle ("Fusil de asalto"), carbine ("Carabina"), compact ("Carabina corta", literally "short carbine"), light machine gun ("Ametralladora") and sharpshooter "(Sniper)" ("Francotirador") variants. The variants are all essentially identical, excepting the short carbine having a shortened fore-end and the sharpshooter being equipped with a fixed adjustable stock rather than the standard folding stock.
Legal dispute with Heckler &amp; Koch.
On February 1, 2007, representatives of the SEDENA (Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional) and Heckler &amp; Koch met in Mexico City to address accusations of patent infringement from the German firm. They claimed that the Army "replicated" the design of the HK G36 assault rifle. After an exhibition of detailed models of the FX-05, the HK representatives were convinced that, despite the similarities between the two rifles, there was not a patent infringement, therefore bringing an end to the disagreement. In the end, the German firm stated that they would not sue on the basis that even though the rifle looks similar it is internally different with a different mechanism.
The report concluded that while externally the FX-05 bears obvious design elements there are several notable differences. The receiver which was styled after the G36 is in fact coupled with a long stroke gas piston similar in operation to an AK type rifle. While the more advanced parts of the rifle were found to be independently Mexican produced, Heckler &amp; Koch officials still questioned the DGIM (the manufacturer of the FX-05) regarding the issue of the rifles receiver system which is identical to the G36's. 
It's believed that the receiver was made to be as similar to the G36 to maximize commonality between the two weapons as many of Mexico's police forces are issued with the G36. Either way it appears that the newer post lawsuit versions of the FX-05 feature a different newly designed receiver, as the newer FX-05 come with a four position fire selection (safe, single shot, three round burst, full auto) whereas the original FX-05 came with only three firing selections (safe, single shot, full auto). This theory is also reinforced by the fact the new black FX-05 models feature a visible metal protrusion before the magazine ejector and the receiver is noticeably smaller.

Re-Up Gang

The Re-Up Gang was an American hip hop group formed in 2004, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The group was formed by Pusha T and Malice, brothers and members of Virginia-based hip hop duo Clipse, alongside Philadelphia-based rappers Rennard "Ab-Liva" East and Sandman. The Re-Up Gang is perhaps best known for their signature "We Got It 4 Cheap" mixtape series.
History.
The Re-Up Gang was created in early 2004, during Clipse's long hiatus between their first and second albums. The group included Clipse themselves, as well as long-time friends Ab-Liva of Major Figgas and Sandman. Pusha T is credited with founding the group, and was responsible for enlisting the help of mixtape DJ Clinton Sparks to put together their first mixtape in an ongoing series, "We Got It 4 Cheap: Vol. 1". While a Re-Up Gang album was planned, no specifics had been released at the time due to Clipse's legal issues with Jive Records. On August 5, 2008 (UK: September 8, 2008) the group released their only album on Koch Records titled "". The album featured nine new songs and three unreleased remixes from "We Got It 4 Cheap Vol. III". Rapper Pusha T said:
"Everything happens for a reason. We put out the "We Got It 4 Cheap" series on our own for the streets and that helped keep us visible and build the Re-Up name as an entity ... This time, [our manager] Tony Draper got with [Koch General Manager] Alan Grunblatt to put together an official album with new music and let Koch Records do what they do best. This release gives us something fresh in the marketplace to reward Re-Up fans while we continue to work on the Clipse album."
In an interview with "HipHopDX", Sandman stated the Re-Up Gang's album had been mishandled. Although there is no animosity between him and the three members, he is now pursuing a solo career. Sandman and Liva still remain in close contact as they always have. The remaining three members are all pursuing solo careers with No Malice releasing his solo titled album "Hear Ye Him" in August 2013 and with Pusha dropping his critically acclaimed "My Name Is My Name" album in October 2013. Pusha T was on Kanye's G.O.O.D Music label before leaving the label in 2022 due to Kanye's antisemitic comments, while No Malice has been focused on his new life making music with a new direction.

Al-Tahawi

Abū Jaʿfar Aḥmad aṭ-Ṭaḥāwī () (853 – 5 November 933), commonly known as at-Tahawi (), was an Egyptian Arab Hanafi jurist and Traditionalist theologian. He studied with his uncle al-Muzani and was a Shafi'i jurist, before then changing to the Hanafi school. He is known for his work al-'Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah, a summary of Sunni Islamic creed which influenced Hanafis in Egypt.
Name.
According to al-Dhahabi, his name was Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Salamah ibn 'Abd al-Malik ibn Salamah, al-Azdi al-Hajari al-Misri al-Tahawi al-Hanafi.
Biography.
Aṭ-Ṭaḥāwī was born in the village of Ṭaḥā in upper Egypt in 853 (239 AH) to an affluent Arab family of Azdī origins. He began his studies with his maternal uncle, Ismāʿīl ibn Yaḥyā al-Muzanī, a leading disciple of ash-Shāfiʿī, but in 873 (259 AH), at approximately 20 years of age, aṭ-Ṭaḥāwī abandoned the Shāfiʿī school of jurisprudence in favour of the Ḥanafī school. Different versions are given by his biographers of his conversion to the Ḥanafī school, but the most probable reason seems to be that the system of Abū Ḥanīfa appealed to his critical insight more than that of ash-Shāfiʿī.
Aṭ-Ṭaḥāwī then studied under the head of the Ḥanafīs in Egypt, Aḥmad ibn Abī ʿImrān al-Ḥanafī, who had himself studied under the two primary students of Abū Ḥanīfa, Abū Yūsuf and Muḥammad ash-Shaybānī. Aṭ-Ṭaḥāwī then travelled to Syria in 882 (268 AH) for further studies in Ḥanafī jurisprudence and became pupil to Abū Khāzim ʿAbd al-Ḥamīd ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz, the chief "qāḍi" of Damascus.
Aṭ-Ṭaḥāwī gained a vast knowledge of ḥadīth in addition to Ḥanafī jurisprudence and his study circles consequently attracted many students of knowledge who related ḥadīth from him and transmitted his works. Among them were al-Da'udi, the head of the Zahiris in Khurasan, and aṭ-Ṭabarānī, well known for his biographical dictionaries of ḥadīth transmitters.
Aṭ-Ṭaḥāwī was famed for his expertise in both ḥadīth and Ḥanafī jurisprudence even during his own lifetime, and many of his works, such as "Kitāb Maʿāni al-Āthār" and "ʿAqīdah aṭ-Ṭaḥāwīyyah," continue to be held in high regard by Sunni Muslims today.
He died on the 14th day of Dhū-l Qaʿdah, 321 AH (5 November 933 CE), and was buried in al-Qarāfah, Cairo.
Legacy.
Many of aṭ-Ṭaḥāwī's contemporaries praised him and noted him as both a reliable scholar and narrator of ḥadīth. He was widely held as a distinguished and prolific writer and became known as the most learned "faqīh" amongst the Ḥanafīs in Egypt, despite having knowledge of all the madhāhib. Over fifteen commentaries have been produced on his creedal treatise, "ʿAqīdah aṭ-Ṭaḥāwīyyah", including "shuruh" by the Hanafi jurist Ismail ibn Ibrahim al-Shaybani and the Taymiyyan-inclined Ibn Abi al-Izz.
Works.
He authored many other works, close to forty different books, some of which are still available today, including:

<doc id="7033977" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7033977" title="4th Avenue Jones">
4th Avenue Jones

4th Avenue Jones (originally 4th Avenue Jones' and sometimes credited as 4th Ave. Jones') was an American alternative hip hop band based in Los Angeles, California. The band was conceived by Ahmad Ali Lewis, popularly known as Ahmad. The band's name comes from the popular idiom "Keeping up with the Joneses" and the street in South Central Los Angeles where they began their rehearsals.
Musical career.
The Interscope years.
After the success of his 1994 platinum single "Back in the Day" as an 18-year-old, Ahmad became frustrated by the corporate politics choking the industry and the "plastic junk" being forced on the masses, and decided to abandon his solo career and form his own label, Lookalive Records. Lookalive was formed to bring together a dream team of gifted musicians who were committed to the art of music.
The vision for the band was conceived in 1997 when Ahmad Jones commenced rehearsals at a house located on 4th Avenue and Jefferson in South Central Los Angeles. In 2000 the band was formed, and the group independently pressed and distributed their first full album "No Plan B". Their persistence paid off as their fan base in the Los Angeles area began to grow. Local weekly gigs soon followed, spreading word of the Jones' classic level of showmanship like wildfire throughout the West Coast music scene.
Interscope Records caught wind of the 4th Avenue Jones' buzz, and quickly offered the band a deal. After enthusiastically completing the 2002 Interscope project, "No Plan B, Pt. II", the band continued to electrify audiences, sharing the stage with such notables as Sheryl Crow, Macy Gray, The Roots, James Brown, The Black Eyed Peas, Musiq, and others. Sadly, they were kept in touring limbo by the label and the album was never released.
Frustrated, the Jones' eventually earned their release from the label altogether. Fortunately, by the time they returned to independent status, releasing another underground album, "Respect", the group had already stamped an influential mark, and their fans stuck with them.
After Interscope.
Inspired with a new vision of things to come, some changes in the band were made. Ahmad enlisted a roster of talent that would position the group for refinement and growth: his wife, Tena Jones on vocals, Tim Stewart aka "Timmy Shakes" on lead guitar, Gailybird on violin, "Phat" Albert Parker on bass, and Derrick "Dee" Calloway on drums.
Their eclectic use of rock-influenced sounds atypical for hip-hop music, especially guitars, was most evident on their first album after leaving Interscope, 2003's compilation "Gumbo" which introduced the public to their new members, with several band members performing solo tracks on the album.
In 2004, 4th Avenue Jones released their fourth independent album "HipRockSoul", and the next year, they released their first Gotee Records-distributed album, titled "Stereo: The Evolution of HipRockSoul" containing re-mastered and re-mixed tracks from the "HipRockSoul" album as well as several new songs. After a lot of underground success, this album was the group's mainstream breakout album earning them a Dove Award nomination as well as awards from several Christian and mainstream hip-hop websites.
Discography.
Singles.
4th Avenue Jones has also recorded a cover of "Jesus Freak" by Christian rock/pop group dc Talk, which appears on the compilation album "Freaked! A Gotee Tribute to dc Talk's "Jesus Freak"".

Mead of poetry

In Norse mythology, the Poetic Mead or Mead of Poetry, also known as Mead of Suttungr, is a mythical beverage that whoever "drinks becomes a skald or scholar" able to recite any information and solve any question. This myth was reported by Snorri Sturluson in Skáldskaparmál. The drink is a vivid metaphor for poetic inspiration, often associated with Odin the god of 'possession' via berserker rage or poetic inspiration.
Plot.
Creation of the mead of poetry and murder of Kvasir.
After the Æsir-Vanir War, the gods sealed the truce they had just concluded by spitting in a vat. To keep a symbol of this truce, they created from their spittle a man named Kvasir. He was so wise that there were no questions he could not answer. He travelled around the world to give knowledge to mankind. One day, he visited the dwarfs Fjalar and Galar. They killed him and poured his blood into two vats and a pot called Boðn, Són, and Óðrerir. They mixed his blood with honey, thus creating a mead which made anybody who drank it a "poet or scholar" ("skáld eða frœðamaðr"). The dwarfs explained to the gods that Kvasir had suffocated in intelligence.
From the dwarfs to Suttungr.
Fjalar and Galar invited a jötunn, Gilling, and his wife. They took him to sea and capsized their boat and the jötunn drowned. The dwarfs then came back home and broke the news to Gilling's wife, which plunged her deep in grief. Fjallar proposed showing her the place where her husband had drowned but Galar got tired of her weeping, went before her and dropped a millstone on her head when she crossed the threshold.
When Gilling's son, Suttungr, learned what had happened, he went to the dwarfs and led them to a reef which was covered with water at high tide. The dwarfs implored him and offered him the mead in compensation for his father's death. Suttungr agreed. When he came back home, he stored the mead in a place called Hnitbjörg where his daughter, Gunnlöd, was in charge of guarding it.
Theft by Odin.
Odin met nine slaves who were scything hay and offered to sharpen their scythes. His whetstone worked so well that they all wanted to buy it. Odin threw it up in the air and the slaves struggled for it to death, cutting each other's throats.
Then he spent the night at Baugi's place. Baugi was Suttungr's brother. He complained that business did not go well since his slaves had killed each other and he could not get anybody to stand in for them. Odin, who said his name was Bölverk, proposed to do their work in exchange for a draught of Suttungr's mead. Baugi agreed, saying that he would try to persuade his brother. During summer, Bölverk did the work as agreed and, in winter, asked Baugi for his owing. They both went to Suttungr's, who refused to give a single drop of the beverage.
Bölverk then suggested Baugi use a trick. He gave him the drill Rati and asked him to bore into the mountain Hnitbjörg. After Baugi tried to deceive him, a hole was actually dug and Bölverk slipped into it, having taken the form of a snake. Baugi tried in vain to hit him with the drill.
He arrived by Gunnlöd, with whom he spent three nights. Thus he could have three draughts of mead. But with each draught he emptied a whole container. He then transformed into an eagle and flew away. When Suttungr discovered the theft, he too took the shape of an eagle and flew off in hot pursuit. When the Æsir saw Odin coming, they set out vessels in readiness to hold the mead and when, in the nick of time, the god arrived, he spat his loot into them. But Suttungr was so close to him that, in his fear and haste, the god let fall some of the precious liquid from his anus. Anybody could drink of this paltry and sullied portion, which was known as the "rhymester's share" ("skáldfífla hlutr"); but the greater portion of the mead of poetry (which had issued from his mouth) Odin gave to the gods and to those truly gifted in poetry.
Adaptations.
The comic book "The Magic Mead" in the Danish comic book series Valhalla, created by Peter Madsen and others, is a retelling of the story of the mead of poetry. Peter Madsen won The SAS Prize for Best Nordic for this comic at the Raptus Festival in Bergen, Norway.

FanDuel Sports Network Florida

FanDuel Sports Network Florida is an American regional sports network owned by Main Street Sports Group (formerly Diamond Sports Group) and operated as an affiliate of FanDuel Sports Network. The channel broadcasts local sports coverage in the state of Florida, with a focus on professional sports teams based in Miami, Tampa and Orlando.
FanDuel Sports Network Florida maintains production facilities and offices located in Fort Lauderdale, alongside sister network FanDuel Sports Network Sun. The channel is available on cable television providers throughout Florida, and in parts of southern Alabama and Georgia; it is also available nationwide on satellite via DirecTV.
History.
FanDuel Sports Network Florida was launched on December 29, 1987, as SportsChannel Florida. It was originally owned by Rainbow Media (a subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corporation), and was the fourth regional network of SportsChannel America. The network originally featured coverage of local college teams, holding the broadcast rights to televise select games from the University of Florida, Florida State University, University of Miami, University of South Florida and Jacksonville University. In addition to national SportsChannel programming, the channel also showed a combined 100 baseball games that featured the New York Yankees and New York Mets from SportsChannel New York, and Chicago White Sox games broadcast by SportsChannel Chicago.
In the spring of 1988, SportsChannel Florida obtained the regional cable television rights to broadcast NBA games from the Miami Heat, effective with the 1988–89 season. In 1992, SportsChannel lost the television contract to the Heat to then-rival Sunshine Network. Heat games would return to the channel in the late 1990s when both networks came under the ownership of Fox Sports parent News Corporation.
In 1996, Florida Panthers owner Wayne Huizenga purchased a 70% controlling interest in SportsChannel Florida, with Rainbow Media (by that time, a joint venture between Cablevision and NBC) retaining a minority 30% interest. That led Huizenga to move the NHL franchise's game telecasts from Sunshine Network to SportsChannel Florida for the 1996–97 season. The following year in 1997, SportsChannel Florida obtained the rights to the Florida Marlins – also owned by Huizenga – which moved 35 games (half the schedule) from the Sunshine Network in that year's Major League Baseball season, with all games moving the following season. In 1998, SportsChannel Florida also gained the regional cable rights to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays Major League Baseball expansion team.
Unlike the other networks that were members of the SportsChannel America chain, Huizenga's control of SportsChannel Florida prevented the channel from joining Fox Sports Net. Shortly after Cablevision and Fox Sports announced the merger in 1997, Cablevision ceased production of its national SportsChannel programming in favor of Fox Sports Net's programming (though the networks would not officially rebrand until early the next year). Since SportsChannel Florida did not have rights to the Fox Sports Net programming, SportsChannel Florida made an affiliation agreement with CNN/SI to carry its programming instead. Cablevision finally repurchased Huizenga's share of the network in November 1999. The network was relaunched as Fox Sports Net Florida on March 1, 2000, making it the last SportsChannel network to adopt the Fox Sports Net brand. At this time Fox Sports Net programming was moved from the Sunshine Network (which Fox only had a minority-interest in) and CNN/SI programming was phased out.
In February 2005, News Corporation acquired Cablevision's ownership stakes in Fox Sports Florida and Fox Sports Ohio, following an asset trade in which Fox sold its interest in Madison Square Garden and the arena's NBA and NHL team tenants, the New York Knicks and New York Rangers, to Cablevision, in exchange for acquiring sole ownership of the two Fox Sports regional networks. News Corporation spun off most of its entertainment properties into 21st Century Fox in July 2013.
On December 14, 2017, as part of a merger between both companies, The Walt Disney Company announced plans to acquire all 22 regional Fox Sports networks from 21st Century Fox, including Fox Sports Florida. However, on June 27, 2018, the Justice Department ordered their divestment under antitrust grounds, citing Disney's ownership of ESPN. On May 3, 2019, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Entertainment Studios (through their joint venture, Diamond Sports Group) bought Fox Sports Networks from The Walt Disney Company for $10.6 billion. The deal closed on August 22, 2019. On November 17, 2020, Sinclair announced an agreement with casino operator Bally's Corporation to serve as a new naming rights partner for the FSN channels. Sinclair announced the new Bally Sports branding for the channels on January 27, 2021. On March 31, 2021, coinciding with the start of the 2021 Major League Baseball season the next day, Fox Sports Florida and sister network Fox Sports Sun rebranded as Bally Sports Florida and Bally Sports Sun, which resulted in 18 other Regional Sports Networks renamed Bally Sports in their respective regions. The first live sporting event on Bally Sports Florida will be the Marlins home opener against the Rays on April 1.
Bankruptcy.
On March 14, 2023, Diamond Sports, the parent company of Bally Sports, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, 30 days after they failed to make a $140M interest payment. Diamond’s first-lien lenders will not be affected as part of the restructuring support agreement, but other creditors will convert their debt into equity. Diamond also plans to separate from Sinclair and become an entirely new entity. 
On July 2, 2024, Bally Sports Florida and the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League mutually agreed to terminate their broadcasting contract early. That same day, the Panthers announced a new broadcast deal with the E. W. Scripps Company's Scripps Sports, which would put games over-the-air on Scripps-owned WSFL-TV in Miami and WHDT in West Palm Beach.
On October 16, 2024, it was revealed in a court filing that Diamond had reached a new sponsorship agreement with FanDuel Group, under which it intends to rebrand Bally Sports as the FanDuel Sports Network; on October 18, 2024, Diamond officially announced the rebranding, which will take effect October 21. Under the agreement, FanDuel will have the option to take a minority equity stake of up to 5% once Diamond Sports exits bankruptcy. The branding will be downplayed within programming related to high school sports.
Programming.
FanDuel Sports Network Florida holds the regional cable television rights to the NBA's Orlando Magic and the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.
FanDuel Sports Network Florida shares the broadcast rights to the aforementioned professional sports teams with Bally Sports Sun (with Miami Heat games transmitted to cable providers in South Florida, and Orlando Magic games aired exclusively on Bally Sports Florida in Central and Northern Florida. The two channels do not focus on one region of Florida, but simply distribute games in accordance with each team's territorial rights, with both cable channels maintaining exclusivity over regional broadcasts of Lightning, Heat, Marlins, Rays and Magic games.
The Tampa Bay Lightning, Miami Heat and Tampa Bay Rays are televised on FanDuel Sports Network Sun, while the Orlando Magic and Miami Marlins are televised on FanDuel Sports Network Florida. Additionally, each network televises exclusive shoulder programming highlighting the team, players and coaches on the corresponding network.
Carriage conflicts.
Bright House.
For its first 21 years of existence, the channel was not available to most cable subscribers in the Orlando area, as Bright House Networks, the largest cable system in central Florida, refused to carry the channel. The conflict stemmed from the system's previous existence as Cablevision (a brand unaffiliated with the Bethpage, New York-based cable provider of the same name), and continued through its acquisition by Time Warner Cable and, later, Bright House. This issue did not change following Fox Sports' acquisition of Sun Sports, now known as Bally Sports Sun, which Bright House already carried on its Orlando area lineup, and continued even after the Orlando Magic moved half of the televised games in its schedule from MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WRBW (channel 65) to Fox Sports Florida in 2007.
Fox Sports Net's sister subsidiary Fox Television Stations had earlier purchased WRBW (then a UPN affiliate) in Orlando in 2001, followed by its purchase of Fox affiliate WOFL (channel 35) in 2002. On paper, this gave News Corporation – the corporate parent of the Fox Sports Networks at the time – the right to require Bright House to carry Fox Sports Florida as part of its retransmission consent compensation agreement for carriage of WOFL and WRBW, but Fox chose not to exercise that right. Bright House would agree to carry Fox Sports Florida on its Orlando system, with the channel being added on digital cable channel 50 on January 1, 2009. News Corporation and Bright House reached a new retransmission agreement on January 1, 2010, preventing both Fox Sports Florida and Sun Sports from being dropped from the provider's central Florida system. Fox would want Bright House to return Fox Sports Florida and Sun Sports to the provider's Orlando service area on February 12, 2010.

William G. Sharp

William Graves Sharp (March 14, 1859 – November 17, 1922) was an American lawyer, diplomat, manufacturer, and three-term congressman, serving from 1909 to 1914.
Biography.
Sharp was born in Mount Gilead, Ohio, on March 14, 1859.
He moved to Elyria, Ohio with his mother and her parents, occupying the Starr-Worthington home on Washington Avenue.
Education and early career.
He graduated LL.B. from the Law Department of the University of Michigan in 1881 and then practiced law in Elyria. He also engaged in the manufacture of charcoal, pig iron, and chemicals. From 1885–88 he was prosecuting attorney of Lorain County, Ohio.
Political career.
He was a Democratic presidential elector in 1892, a Democratic candidate for Congress in 1900, and a member of the Sixty-first to the Sixty-third Congresses (1909–15), but resigned in 1914 to become Ambassador to France by appointment of President Wilson. He served until April 14, 1919, then returned to Elyria, Ohio, and engaged in literary pursuits.
Sharp was known as the Father of Air Mail due to his vision of using aircraft for postal delivery. He crafted legislation for this goal which was eventually successful in being passed.
He was one of two Elyrians to have served in Congress and also one of two Lorain Countians (Myron T. Herrick) to have served as Ambassador to France during the early 20th century.
Death and burial.
He died on November 17, 1922, in Elyria, Ohio, and was interred in Ridgelawn Cemetery.
Family home.
The family's Elyria home was purchased in 1945 by the Washington Avenue Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) congregation which was relocating at that time from Elyria's Second Street. The Sharp home was incorporated into the church's new building, dedicated in 1951. Many of the mansion’s interior architectural details–including marble fireplaces, decorative ceiling mouldings, plaster reliefs on the parlor walls, and a beautiful grand staircase–remain.
Through the efforts of the Elyria Historical Association, Lorain County Historical Society, Ohio History Connection, and Washington Avenue Christian Church, an historical marker (Lorain County's 7th and Lorain County's 35th) was unveiled on the Washington Avenue property on September 3, 2020, with approximately 50 people present. Remarks at the unveiling were presented by the Honorable Frank Whitfield, Mayor of the City of Elyria, Mr. Bill Bird, President of the Elyria Historical Association, Ms. Kerri Broome, Executive Director of the Lorain County Historical Society, and the Rev. Nathan A. Russell, Senior Pastor.

Tomás Ó Sé

Tomás Ó Sé (; born 21 June 1978) is an Irish former Gaelic footballer. He played Gaelic football with Nemo Rangers and at senior level for the Kerry county team from 1998 until he retired in 2013, playing predominantly in the half-back line. In one of the most decorated careers in Gaelic Games, Ó Sé won 5 All-Ireland titles, 9 Munster titles and was Footballer of the Year in 2004. His brothers Darragh and Marc are played Gaelic footballer and represented Kerry at the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship.
In retirement from playing he became an analyst on "The Sunday Game". He also became involved in the Offaly county football team, under the management of John Maughan.
Playing career.
Club.
Born in Ard an Bhóthair, Ceann Trá, County Kerry, Ó Sé played his club football with his local club called An Ghaeltacht and made his debut with the club's senior team in the mid-1990s where he soon became an ever-present fixture in the half-back line.
In 2000, an Ghaeltacht reached the final of the county senior championship for the very first time. Ó Sé's side were the red-hot favourites but their opponents Dr Crokes took charge. A hard-fought 1–4 to 0–6 score line resulted in defeat for an Ghaeltacht.
In 2001, an Ghaeltacht regrouped and reached a second consecutive county final with Tralee-based club Austin Stacks providing the opposition. Ó Sé's side were well prepared. A conclusive 1–13 to 0–10 victory gave Ó Sé his first county winners' medal.
An Ghaeltacht surrendered their club title in 2002, however, the following year Ó Sé's side were back in the county championship decider. Laune Rangers were the opponents on this occasion, however, the game ended in a 0–10 apiece draw. The replay a fortnight later was a much more conclusive affair. A 0–12 to 2–4 score line gave an Ghaeltacht the victory and gave Ó Cinnéide a second county winners' medal in three years. This victory allowed the club to represent Kerry in the provincial club championship. A successful campaign saw Ó Sé's side reach the provincial final against St Senan's of Clare. A close game developed, however, the Kerrymen held on in the end to secure a 1–8 to 1–6 victory, giving Ó Sé a Munster club winners' medal.
An Ghaeltacht continued their march in the All-Ireland series and on St. Patrick's Day 2004 played in the All-Ireland club championship final. Caltra from County Galway, provided the opposition and an exciting game developed. Dara Ó Cinnéide faced the heartbreak of missing a goal in the dying seconds as an Ghaeltacht lost out by just a single point – 0–13 to 0–12.
The following few years saw Ó Sé enjoy little success with the club after the victories of the earlier parts of the decade.
Junior, minor and under-21.
Ó Sé first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kerry junior football team in 1995. That year he captured a Munster title following a thrilling 1–21 to 0–19 victory after extra-time against Cork. Kerry's championship run came to an end in the All-Ireland semi-final, when London narrowly defeated Ó Sé's side by 2–10 to 1–12.
By the mid-1990s, Ó Sé had joined the Kerry minor football team. In 1996 Kerry reached the provincial decider, with Ó Sé as centre-back. Age-old rivals Cork provided the opposition, however, a 3–9 to 2–6 gave Ó Sé a Munster title in the minor grade. A place in the All-Ireland final quickly followed with Laois lining out in opposition. A close game developed, however, Ó Sé's side narrowly lost by 2–11 to 1–11.
By 1997, Ó Sé had joined the Kerry under-21 team and began a successful three-year spell. In his first year Kerry defeated Cork after a replay to take the Munster title. Ó Sé's side were later defeated in the All-Ireland semi-final.
In 1998, Kerry retained their Munster under-21 crown after a 3–10 to 1–11 defeat of Tipperary. Ó Sé's side went one better on this occasion by reaching the All-Ireland final. Laois provided the opposition, however, Kerry won on a score line of 2–8 to 0–11. It was Ó Sé's first All-Ireland under-21 title.
Kerry won three Munster titles in-a-row in 1999 following a six-point defeat of Cork. A second consecutive All-Ireland final appearance followed with Westmeath providing the opposition. While Kerry were the favourites the Leinster champions went on to make history by capturing their first All-Ireland title on a score line of 0–12 to 0–9. This was Ó Sé's last game with the Kerry under-21 team.
Senior.
By 1998 Ó Sé was also a member of the kerry senior football team, making his senior debut in a Munster Championship game against Cork that year, but he played no part in Kerry's subsequent defeat of Tipperary in the Munster final. Ó Sé's side were later dumped out of the championship by a Mick O'Dwyer-managed Kildare in the All-Ireland semi-final.
In 1999, Kerry were attempting to secure a fourth provincial title in succession, while Ó Sé was hopeful of winning his first on the field of play. Cork put an end to this dream with a 2–10 to 2–4 win over their great rivals in the Munster final. With that Kerry were dumped out of the championship.
After a low point the previous year, Kerry were back in the provincial decider again in 2000, with Clare providing the opposition. In a disappointing match, Kerry heavily defeated 'the Banner men' by 3–15 to 0–8.
It was Ó Sé's first Munster medal on the field of play. Kerry had firmly established their All-Ireland contender credentials, however, the All-Ireland series proved difficult. Ó Sé's side drew with Armagh in the semi-final, while the replay proved just as tense. Again both sides finished level after seventy minutes and it took a period of extra-time to find a winner. Kerry narrowly emerged from that game as the 2–15 to 1–15 winners and to win a place in the Millennium All-Ireland final. Galway provided the opposition in what was their second championship decider appearance in three years. Both sides missed easy chances and seemed apprehensive about taking a lead. Galway trailed by seven points at one stage, but clawed their way back to secure a 0–14 apiece draw. The replay was a much more conclusive affair. Galway worked the ball the length of the field to Declan Meehan who scored a goal to give the westerners a boost. A disputed free with seventeen minutes left in the game gave Kerry a lead which they would not relinquish. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the champions by 0–17 to 1–10. It was Ó Sé's first All-Ireland winners' medal.
Kerry swept through the provincial series again in 2001. A 0–19 to 1–13 defeat of Cork gave Ó Sé a second Munster winners' medal and gave Kerry a boost in their All-Ireland ambitions. In a new innovation called the All-Ireland qualifiers series, Kerry's provincial victory allowed them to advance to the All-Ireland quarter-final. An exciting draw and a replay with Dublin at Semple Stadium gave Ó Sé's side the right to advance to an All-Ireland semi-final showdown with Meath. There was some controversy leading up to the game with new squad member Eoin Brosnan getting the captaincy before the game, despite not yet having established himself as a regular. There was also great debate about the refusal to start the legendary Maurice Fitzgerald, particularly after his performance in the Dublin game. In one of the lowest points ever for Kerry football, Ó Sé's side were absolutely demolished by on a score line of 2–14 to 0–5.
In 2002, Kerry faced more controversy. The team was forced to play a replay of their Munster semi-final against Cork only a few of days after the funeral of the brother of team manager Páidí Ó Sé and father of Tomás, Darragh and Marc Ó Sé. Cork took full advantage and Kerry embarked on a qualifier campaign which saw them account for Wicklow, Fermanagh and Kildare before they trounced reigning champions Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-final before stuffing archrivals Cork in a unique all-Munster All-Ireland semi-final. The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted Kerry against Armagh in one of the great finals. The first-half saw everything going Kerry's way while Armagh floundered. The Ulster men lost John McEntee to concussion while Oisín McConville missed a penalty just before the interval. As it stood Armagh trailed by four points at half-time while Darragh Ó Sé gave an inspirational performance. A different Armagh team emerged in the second-half. McConville compensated for his earlier miss by scoring a key goal in the 55th minute. Kerry froze after this and failed to score for the rest of the match as Armagh went on to narrowly win their first All-Ireland by 1–12 to 0–14.
Kerry regrouped after this blow and reached the provincial decider once again in 2003. Limerick provided the opposition; however, they were no match for 'the Kingdom'. A 1–11 to 0–9 victory gave Ó Sé a third Munster winners' medal. After an exciting game with Roscommon, Kerry advanced to an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Tyrone. After being shocked in the latter stages of the two previous championships, Kerry were favourites going into the match. The whole team struggled, however, and Kerry looked like they were going to be left behind with the new "blanket defence" that was introduced by teams like Armagh and perfected by Tyrone. Many criticised this tactic as a means of stopping talented footballers like Ó Sé and Colm Cooper from playing but few could deny its effectiveness. A 0–13 to 0–6 defeat saw Tyrone advance to the All-Ireland final while Kerry were unceremoniously dumped out of the championship.
2004 saw Jack O'Connor take over as manager of the Kerry team. Ó Sé's side reached the final of the National League and in an exciting 3–11 to 1–6 victory Kerry claimed the title and Ó Sé picked up a first National League winners' medal. Kerry later booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and, for the second year in succession, Limerick were the opponents. Surprisingly, that game ended in a 1–10 apiece draw. The replay was also a close-run affair; however, Kerry never really looked in danger of losing. A 3–10 to 2–9 victory gave Ó Sé a fourth Munster winners' medal. The All-Ireland series proved no difficulty for Kerry, and 'the Kingdom' booked their place in the All-Ireland final against Mayo. An early goal from Alan Dillon gave the Connacht men some hope, however, the game was effectively over after twenty-five minutes when Colm Cooper scored Kerry's only goal of the day. The points kept coming from Ó Sé's team and an injury-time Michael Conroy goal was nothing but a consolation for Mayo. A 1–20 to 2–9 victory gave Ó Sé a second All-Ireland winners' medal. He ended the year by collecting his first All-Star award.
In 2005, Kerry were favourites to retain their All-Ireland title. All was going to plan as Ó Sé's side reached yet another provincial final. In a return to tradition, Cork were the opponents. A close game developed, however, in the end Kerry were the narrow winners by 1–11 to 0–11. It was Ó Sé's eighth Munster winners' medal. Following this win Kerry cruised through the All-Ireland series to reach another championship decider with Tyrone providing the opposition. In one of the great finals of the decade, the result remained in doubt until the final whistle. Dara Ó Cinnéide powered the team ahead with a goal after just six minutes. Ó Sé launched the Kerry comeback in the 57th minute with Kerry's second goal; however, it was too late. Tyrone hung on to win by 1–16 to 2–10. It was Ó Sé's second defeat in an All-Ireland final. There was some consolation when Ó Sé picked up a second All-Star award at the end of the year.
In 2006, Kerry reached the final of the National League and played Galway. Ó Sé's side could only manage three points in the opening half, however, the introduction of Eoin Brosnan transformed the team. At the end of the seventy minutes, a 2–12 to 0–10 score line gave Kerry their 18th National League title. The league win was a false dawn as Kerry went out tamely to Cork in a replay of the Munster final. The team, however, bounced back against Longford to set up a meeting with Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter-final. At half-time it looked as though the Ulser hoodoo would strike again but Kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half with Ó Sé dominating midfield while Kieran Donaghy shone at full-forward. They won by a score of 3–15 to 1–13, in the process putting an end to the notion that Kerry had no answer to the northern style of defensive play. Kerry again beat Cork in the subsequent semi-final before lining out against Mayo in the All-Ireland final. An unbelievable opening first-half saw Kerry go 2–4 to no score ahead after just ten minutes, courtesy of goals by Declan O'Sullivan and Kieran Donaghy. Colm Cooper slotted a third Kerry goal, however, Mayo settled and reduced the deficit to 3–8 to 3–2 at half-time. The second thirty-five minutes saw Kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points. A final score of 4–15 to 3–5 gave Kerry another All-Ireland title and gave Ó Sé his third All-Ireland winners' medal.
In 2007, Ó Sé had a fine National League campaign which carried on into the Munster championship. That year Kerry faced Cork in the provincial decider once again. A close game developed, however, at the full-time whistle Kerry were the champions by 1–15 to 1–13. It was Ó Sé's sixth Munster winners' medal. Kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their All-Ireland quarter-final against Monaghan, before defeating Dublin in a glamour All-Ireland semi-final. The subsequent All-Ireland final was an historic occasion as Kerry faced Cork in the very first all-Munster championship decider. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. Cork goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3–13 to 1–9. It was a fourth All-Ireland medal for Ó Sé. A third All-Star award quickly followed.
2008 began in controversial circumstances as Ó Sé's side lost team captain Paul Galvin to suspension after an incident with referee Paddy Russell in the Munster semi-final against Clare. The subsequent Munster final saw Kerry take an eight-point lead over Cork at half-time. 'The Rebels' fought back and, in a massive downpour, Kerry could only muster three points in the second period of play as Cork secured a remarkable 1–16 to 1–11 victory. Kerry worked their way through the qualifiers to an All-Ireland final appearance against Tyrone. An exciting game developed, one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years. The sides were level seven times before Colm Cooper nudged Kerry 0–8 to 0–7 ahead before the interval. Tyrone wore Kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from Tommy McGuigan and a string of late points inspired Tyrone to their third All-Ireland title of the decade. In spite of the defeat Ó Sé picked up a fourth All-Star.
In 2009, Ó Sé picked up his third National League winners' medal following a defeat of Derry. Kerry's next game was a Munster semi-final meeting with Cork. That game ended in a draw, however, Kerry were well beaten in the replay. 'The Kingdom' were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over Longford, Sligo and Antrim. Ó Sé and his squad later lined out in the All-Ireland quarter-final and thrashed Dublin before overcoming Meath in a disappointing semi-final. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Kerry face Cork for the third time in that year's championship. Ó Sé's side entered the game as slight underdogs, however, they had the trump card of having never lost a game to Cork at Croke Park. Kerry stuttered in the opening period and trailed by 0–1 to 1–3 early in the first-half. The Kerry team stuck to their gameplan while Cork recorded fourteen wides. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the champions again by 0–16 to 1–9. It was Ó Sé's sixth All-Ireland winners' medal, his fifth on the field of play. His contribution to the championship was later recognised when he picked up a fifth All-Star award while also being named Texaco Footballer of the Year.
In 2010, Ó Sé bowed out of the championship in disgrace. Having started the championship brightly, beating Cork in the Munster championship semi-final, Kerry met Limerick in the final. Limerick led early on but Kerry rallied in the later stages and secured the win. In the aftermath of the game, video footage of the game exposed Ó Sé as having made numerous attempts to elbow Limerick star forward Stephen Kelly in the head. Ó Sé's actions were carried out under the radar of the referee in charge and therefore went unpunished. However, the CCCC handed him a ban a week later which saw him on the side lines until Kerry were eventually knocked out of the championship by Down.
In 2011, Ó Sé's first championship match was against Tipperary in the Munster senior football championship quarter final. The game contained a number of talking points, but the main one occurred when Ó Sé was involved in an off-the-ball incident with Hugh Coghlan from Tipperary in front of the stand in the 33rd minute. The linesman witnessed Ó Sé strike Coghlan, leaving match official Maurice Condon with no option but to red card Ó Sé. Since this was the second such offence for Ó Sé in the space of a year – though his first offence against Limerick's Stephen Kelly's was dealt with post-match in 2010 – the mandatory ban was doubled up to 2 months which again saw him sit out the remainder of the Munster championship.
2012 started in a similar fashion for Ó Sé. Kerry's first outing in the national league was against Tipperary. Having become involved in an off-the-ball incident with Tipperary wing-forward Hugh Coughlan, the referee was alerted to Ó Sé's indiscretion by the linesman, with the straight red card that followed meaning that the defender was again suspended.
Ó Sé returned to the fray in Kerry's league tie with Laois. Ó Sé played for approximately 10 minutes before being sent off again having become involved in an off the ball incident. The referee brandished the red for a 'striking' offence. Due to this being a 3rd such infraction inside 10 months, the mandatory ban was again doubled meaning Tomas was forced to sit out the remainder of the national league.
In 2013, Kerry started the league slowly, with losses at the hands of Mayo, Dublin, Kildare and champions Donegal. Relegation was looming. During the game against Donegal, Ó Sé was red carded for an off the ball incident with Ryan McHugh. This was Tomas' fifth red card between 2010 and 2013, all 5 involving 'off the ball' incidents. Tomas sat out the next game against Down, which Kerry won and registered their first win of the league campaign.
Retirement.
In October 2013, Ó Sé announced his retirement from inter-county football.
Éamonn Fitzmaurice, who was managing Kerry at the time, paid tribute to Ó Sé, saying he was "the best wing back that I have seen play the game. In many ways Tomás epitomised everything that Kerry football is all about. His commitment, determination and never-say-die attitude were plainly visible every time he took to the pitch."
At the time of his retirement he was the longest-serving inter-county footballer, and he is widely considered one of the greatest players of the modern game.
Media career.
Ó Sé joined RTÉ's "The Sunday Game" and quickly established himself as a regular analyst.
Ó Sé was working for RTÉ on their television coverage of the 2019 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship semi-final between Dublin and Mayo at Croke Park on Saturday 10 August. Tomás went to the toilet at the start of the second half. Mayo had a half-time lead of two points. By the time Tomás had returned to the RTÉ studio, Dublin had scored 1–2 on their way to defeating Mayo and confirming their place in a fifth successive All-Ireland SFC final. Tomás's trip to the toilet was remarked upon during the post-match analysis as an example of how quickly Dublin had turned the match in their favour. While Tomás was on (or possibly over) the toilet (he declined to reveal the exact manner in which he had relieved himself), Con O'Callaghan scored the first of his two goals in the game, following a Dean Rock point from a free. A point from Niall Scully completed the 1–2 missed by while Tomás was on or over the toilet. Joe Brolly, writing in the following day's "Sunday Independent", referred to Ó Sé's "mistake" that coincided with Mayo's "melting down". On "The Sunday Game" highlights programme on the night after the match, Tomás's trip to the toilet was again discussed and dissected as part of the semi-final games analysis. However, no further details were revealed.
Ó Sé also writes for the "Irish Independent".
Managerial career.
He coached the Glanmire minor footballers to a county title. In 2021, he worked with the John Maughan-managed Offaly senior football team and was linked with that job when Maughan left.
On 23 August 2022, Ó Sé was named as manager of the Kerry under-20 football team.
Personal life.
Ó Sé lives in Glanmire, County Cork, and he works as a teacher in Fermoy, a career he chose to accommodate his football.

Avraham Aharon Price

Abraham Aharon Price (December 10, 1900 – March 30, 1994) was a renowned Torah scholar, writer, educator, and a community leader in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was one of the city's most influential rabbinic figures.
Early life.
Abraham Aharon Price was born on December 10, 1900, in Stopnica, a town in Busko County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland, to Rabbi Joseph and Basia Price. At the age of 7, he studied with Rabbi Jerusalimski in Kielce. At the age of 9, he was sent to study with Rabbi Avrohom Bornsztain, founder of the Sochatchov Hasidic dynasty and author of "Avnei Nezer". He was ordained by Rabbi Sillman at the Rabbinical Seminary in Sochaczew, Poland in 1919. In 1923, Price moved to Berlin, where he became a banker. In Berlin, he studied with Rabbi Chaim Heller after business hours. In connection with rise of Nazism, he fled Berlin for Paris in the early 1930s, and lived there before arriving in Toronto, Canada, in 1937.
Career.
In Toronto, Price was named dean of the Torat Chaim yeshiva and was rabbi of several congregations. In 1941 he ordained the first three rabbis to be ordained in Canada. Initially, Yeshiva Torat Chaim was based in a crowded room on College Street. Then, it moved to a house at Ulster and Markham Street, Toronto, and seven years later, to his yeshiva building at the corner of Montrose Avenue and College Street.
Notable students.
Many prominent rabbis were ordained at Price's yeshiva and many students received their Hebrew and Talmudic educations there. A number of Price's students became influential community leaders in their own right.
World War II refugees.
Despite Canada’s restrictive immigration policy towards Jewish refugees during the Holocaust, Price worked to have young Jewish refugees released from internment camps to come study in his yeshiva. In 1942, Price worked with the Canadian Jewish Congress and Senator Arthur Roebuck to negotiate the release of 50 men from an internment camp in Quebec. In 1948, he sponsored 55 young Czechoslovak refugees. Many of these individuals went on to study under his tutelage in his yeshiva where he ensured they were housed, clothed, and provided with mentorship.
Library.
Rabbi Price was known for his impressive collection of rabbinic materials. By 1950 The "Toronto Daily Star" reported on his library:
As Rabbi A. A. Price works in his study on Palmerston Blvd., he is surrounded by what is probably the largest private library of Hebrew books on this continent, a total of 2,200 volumes. Among them is one published in Italy 416 years ago and written by Benjamin Zev, a physician and scholar. There is only on other copy of Zev's book know to exist and it is in the British Museum...
Rabbi Price's present library represents less than half of the original collection owned by the Polish-born, 51-year-old rabbi. He had them brought over after he decided to extend a visit to Toronto in 1935 into a permanent stay. The rest of his books were destroyed in Paris by the Germans a week before the French capital was liberated. His brother and sister were killed in France by the Nazis, and recently an orphaned niece arrived in Toronto.
After his death, more than 3,000 items from his collection of rabbinical works, some of them very old, were donated to the University of Toronto Library. Many of his older books are now held at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library at the University of Toronto in the Price Collection of Rabbinics.
Writings.
Price authored at least four sets of books. Mishnat Avraham (Vol. 1 and 2 published in 1944) and Imrei Avraham (Vol. 1 published in 1946, Vol. 2 published in 1975) both contain his speeches and writings on the weekly torah portion and the Jewish holidays. The other two sets contain his commentary on two important 13th Century Jewish texts. The three-volume Sefer Hasidim is a commentary on the 12th-13th Century work of the same name by Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg. The four-volume Mitzvot Gadol is a commentary on one of the earliest codifications of Halakah by Judah's student, Moses ben Jacob of Coucy, known as "SeMaG", short for Sefer Mitzvot Gadol.
Honours.
In 1965 Price was awarded the Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook award of merit signed by the mayor of Tel Aviv on the recommendation of the Chief Rabbis of Israel, Isser Yehuda Unterman and Yitzhak Nissim. Price donated his prize money to aid impoverished rabbis in Israel.
Foundation.
The Rabbi Price Foundation is involved in the advancement of Jewish education and also in the completion and publication of Price's in-progress manuscripts.

New minor forcing

New Minor Forcing (NMF), is a contract bridge bidding convention used to find a 5-3 or 4-4 major suit fit after a specific sequence of bids in which opener has rebid one notrump. The convention is triggered by responder at his second turn by an artificial bid of two in an unbid minor; it requires that he hold five cards in the major he has previously bid and an unlimited hand ranging in value from at least game invitational strength (11 or more points) to that sufficient to have interest in slam; he may also hold four cards in the other major. Accordingly, there are six bidding sequences in which the New Minor Forcing bid may be applied:
 Auction notes:1. The opponents are silent throughout.2. The ! indicates that the bid is .
The New Minor Forcing bid by responder is forcing for one round and asks partner for further information on his shape and strength with the primary objectives of determining if opener has three-card support for responder's five-card major and/or if there is a 4-4 fit in hearts; other major suit fits are also investigated.
In sequences 5 and 6, the NMF bid is made in the stronger minor suit. A jump by responder in an unbid minor after a 1NT rebid by opener is weak and to play.
The bid of the new minor must be by opener.
Responses and continuations.
Methods differ on the priority and meaning of opener's response to the NMF asking bid.
According to Seagram and Smith, the priority for responses by opener are:
Others suggest that the first priority is to show three-card support for responder's major. Partnership agreement on this and other continuations is required.
Examples.
Typical hands suitable for use of the New Minor Forcing convention include the following:
Given the auction:
1 – 1; 1NT – 2 (NMF)
Given the auction:
1 – 1; 1NT – 2 (NMF)
When playing this convention, jump rebids by responder are typically played as invitational, as NMF can be used with hands wishing to force to game. For example, on the auction above, a 3 bid would be used with a hand such as , to show an interest in game, but only in hearts.
If you're playing New Minor Forcing, the auction:
1 – 1; 1NT – 3 shows a 5 card heart suit and at least 5 spades with a game-going hand. Without New Minor Forcing you may bid 3 on something like 
Also the auction:
1 – 1; 1NT – 2 can show a hand with 5 spades and 4 or 5 hearts with no interest in game
Opener's rebid shows both shape and strength. Although there is variation among partnerships regarding the priority of suits to show, a common agreement is that first priority is to show secondary support for responder's suit, then four cards in the other major, then additional length in a minor, with a jump to show a maximum.
Given the auction:
Opener's third bids and their meanings would be:
Bids at the three level show similar hands, but with a maximum. The meanings of the strength ranges are dependent on a partnership's opening-bid style, as well as its notrump range. Assuming a Standard American 15-17 1NT, a minimum would typically be 12-13 HCP and a maximum would be 14 HCP or some very good 13 HCP hands.
A similar scheme can be applied after opener's 2NT rebid, which typically shows 18-19 HCP: bid of a new minor is forcing by responder (although lesser values are required), and the opener shows the distribution in the same manner. The opener should not jump-rebid at the four level in this case, so as to not skip 3NT (responder's NMF doesn't generally guarantee 5-card major or 4–4 in majors).

Council on Legislation (Sweden)

The Council on Legislation () is a Swedish government agency composed of current and former justices of the Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative Court. Its function is to pronounce on the legal validity of legislative proposals at the request of the government or a Riksdag standing committee.
The council's pronouncements are not binding, but are usually adhered to. The government is not obligated to allow the council to review every bill (), but it has to provide a rationale if it does not allow the council do so.
Using legal terminology, the Legislative Council carries out "judicial preview" or alternatively "abstract legal review".

Toyota Land Cruiser (J70)

The 70 Series is a family of Toyota Land Cruiser models produced since 1984. It replaced the 25-year-old 40 Series as the off-road model of the Land Cruiser lineup, while the contemporary 60 Series developed into more comfortable luxury SUVs starting with the 80 Series. Despite major changes in styling and numerous technological updates, the 70 Series was designed to retain the off-road capabilities and durability associated with the 40 Series.
Model designations.
Originally, model numbers 70 through 74 referred to the two-door short- and medium-wheelbase versions. These were the successors of the 40 Series, such as the FJ40. Model numbers 75, 78 and 79 referred to the long-wheelbase version, which was available in pickup and two-door troop carrier models. These were the successors of the less-well known long-wheelbase 40 Series, such as the FJ45. Models 77 (1990–1999 JDM) and 76 are a semi-long wheelbase four-door wagon in a few markets.
In 1999, Toyota introduced several updates and changed the model designations, where the long-wheelbase models became the 78 (troop carrier) and 79 (pickup). In 2007, the 76 (four-door wagon) was added, while the new dual-cab models also share the 79 model designation (essentially the same chassis). Short-wheelbase models are only in production today for a few select markets.
As with all Land Cruisers, the letters at the beginning of the model number designate the engine of the vehicle. Common engines in the 70 series include the 3F petrol engine (e.g., the FJ70), the 22R petrol engine (e.g. the RJ70/73 Bundera), the 2H diesel engine (e.g., the HJ75), the 1FZ petrol engine (e.g., the FZJ70/71/73/74/75/76/78/79), the 1PZ diesel engine (e.g., the PZJ70/73/77), the 1HZ diesel engine (e.g., the HZJ70/71/73/74/75/76/77/78/79), the 1HD diesel engine (e.g. the HDJ78/79), and most recently, the 1VD diesel engine (e.g., the VDJ76). For a while (1987 until at least 1990) the BJ73 hardtop was available in the Portuguese, Italian and Spanish markets with a VM five-cylinder HR588 2.5-litre turbodiesel — the "B" prefix was applied because the first four-cylinder diesel 70 series came with the 3B.
History.
1984–1999: The 70 / 75 series Toyota Land Cruiser took over from the 40 / 45 series of workhorse four-wheel drives in 1984. The styling maintained a family resemblance to the 40 / 45 series but became more angular. The 70 / 71 series was the short-wheelbase (SWB), the 73 / 74 was the medium-wheelbase (MWB) and the 75 / 78 was the long-wheelbase (LWB). The latter came as cab-chassis/utility with a "panelled" tray (pickup), and "troop carrier" hard-top (HT). Toyota also manufactured lighter duty versions that shared the 70 Series designation from 1985 to 1996 and were marketed in various parts of the world initially as the Bundera, or Land Cruiser II and later as the Prado. Of these, the Prado name stuck, and each modification took it further from its 70 Series roots. Starting in 1997, the Prado was known as the 90 Series and had become a passenger 4x4 with no relation to the 70 Series.
1999: In August, the 70-series underwent its second facelift. The grille now had three horizontal bars with upturned ends, and the combination lights were made larger. In Japan, all 70-series were given a chrome grille. The pickup version was designated the 79 series, the Troop Carrier became the 78 series, and the short-wheelbase version was phased out in most markets. The principal mechanical changes were: coil spring (instead of leaf spring) live front axle; longer rear leaf springs; 5-bolt wheels instead of 6-bolt wheels; redesigned steering wheel; redesigned front indicators; and, in the cab-chassis, a longer wheelbase, which increased the rear storage capacity.
2004 Japanese market sales ended in June as the 70-series could not meet the and particle matters law.
2007: The facelifted 70 Series began production in January for market release in late February / early March 2007. Changes involve significant modifications to the front-end design, eliminating the trademark flat fenders featured on all commercial Land Cruiser series' since the 40 series. This change along with a wider front axle/track and wider chassis were required to allow fitment of the new Euro-4 compliant 4.5L V8 turbo diesel, the 1VD-FTV. This engine was initially just for the Australian market, where it was the only engine available. Africa and other markets continued with straight-6 petrol and 1HZ diesel engines. In order to fill the hole left by the elimination of lower-specification models in the 100-series and 200-series ranges, a 4-door wagon variant (The 76 series) was introduced alongside the long-running cab-chassis (79 series) and Troop Carrier (78 series) bodies. For the first time a higher GXL specification level was also introduced in some markets for the cab-chassis and wagon variants. This specification level added numerous additional comfort and safety features never previously seen on commercial series Land Cruisers. In 2007 they were made in Venezuela the 50th anniversary version, came with bumper, gasoline bottle, rear blockers, winch, stirrups. Only 300 were made.
2009: Venezuela's President Hugo Chávez threatened to expropriate Toyota's plants in that country if Toyota and other car makers refused to share their technology with local businesses and meet certain quotas. The 70 series Land Cruiser is used throughout Venezuela for the transportation community, the police, and the National Guard of Venezuela.
2009: The 1FZ/1FZ-FE engine was replaced by the 4.0L 1GR-FE in the markets where petrol-powered versions are available, such as Bolivia, Colombia and the Middle East.
2012: Toyota introduced a double-cabin HZJ79 pickup body type, combining the longer 3180 mm wheelbase of the previous two-door pickup with the four doors and single, 130-litre fuel tank of the wagon body types.
2014: Although it had been discontinued in 2004, Toyota reintroduced a limited-edition '30th Anniversary' 70-series for a 12-month run in the Japanese market. It was available either as a 4-door wagon (GRJ76) or a double-cabin pickup body (GRJ79). This model came with the 1GR-FE V6 petrol engine and 5-speed manual transmission. This model was on limited sale in Japan only until June 2015 when Japanese law required all new vehicles to come with Vehicle Skid Control, something the 70 Series does not have.
2015: The Land Cruiser 70 started production by Salvador Caetano in Ovar, Portugal in an updated version from mid 2015 onwards for export to the African market, Morocco in particular. However, the model won't be reintroduced to the European market because its engines are not emissions-certified in Europe. This is in spite of the 1VD-FTV being available for the Land Cruiser 200 in a twin-turbo version. The Portuguese-built Land Cruisers have a engine and a five-speed manual transmission. Production initially consisted of a five-door station wagon and a double-cab pickup.
2022: Ongoing modifications brought the 70 series abreast of ratcheting safety and environmental regulation. The 2022 model for Australia met Euro 5 emissions standards, while accommodating front and side airbags (a significant task given the rigid ladder frame) and frame strengthening to meet side impact requirements. The Land Cruiser 76 wagon was reintroduced earlier taking advantage of these safety improvements, in early 2021 it accounted for more than half of 70 series Australian private sales.
2023: The optional 2.8-litre "1GD-FTV" engine became available exclusively with an automatic transmission, alongside the existing engines with manual transmissions. Incandescent headlights were replaced with LED units, and the combination meter was changed to a 40-series inspired look, with an additional 4.2 inch colour multi-information display. Ashtrays were deleted from the equipment list, along with the cigarette lighter.
Features.
The J70 Land Cruiser utility has two or four doors with steel doors; the front-clip styling remains much like that of the 40 Series. The grille can be mesh or can consist of three horizontal bars. There are three additional horizontal slots in a single line in the sheet metal under the grille. Front turn signals are square with triangular white lens elements underneath, and are affixed to the vertical edge of the front clip above the fenders and just outboard of each headlight. The top can be hard or soft. The doors are hard, with roll-up windows. Taillights are long, vertical rectangles inset low into the rear bodywork. Rear doors are paired swing-out 'barn doors'. The windscreens of some military versions will fold down to the bonnet. It is available in many forms, including a four-door semi-long (J77V → J76V), a pickup (J75P → J79P), and long-wheelbase utility wagon (J75V → J77V / J78V).
With the exception of a few light-duty models that evolved into the Prado, all 70 Series Land Cruisers have solid leaf-sprung rear axles. The front solid axles were leaf-sprung until 1998, when Toyota decided in favour of a coil spring front suspension with leading arms, and a slightly lighter front axle. Also beginning in 1999 the rear leaf springs were extended to allow for greater wheel travel (articulation) and increased ride comfort.
Most 70 Series Land Cruisers (both petrol and diesel models) use inline six-cylinder engines. The exceptions are the V8 diesel 1VD-FTV engine introduced in some markets in 2007, the V6 petrol 1GR-FE introduced in 2009, and the inline four diesel 1GD-FTV introduced in 2023, with the last straight-6 available being the diesel 1HZ for markets with less stringent emission rules such as Africa and Bolivia. Regardless of the engine, a 5-speed manual transmission delivers power to a part-time four-wheel-drive transfer case with high and low range. The solid front axles are a full-floating design with manual locking hubs. The solid rear axles are available in semi-floating and full-floating variations. Selectable locking differentials (front and rear) are factory options in some markets.
Basic comfort features such as air-conditioning and radio are available, but the 70 Series lacks many of the refined and luxury features of the more expensive passenger Land Cruisers (80, 90, 100, and 200 Series). 70-series Land Cruisers were usually fitted with manual transmissions, although a four-speed automatic was available on select versions like the FJ73 (1985–1992), the BJ74, the HZJ73/77 (1990–1999), and the HZJ74/76K (1999–2004).
Short wheelbase models.
The suspension, interior and basic layout of these models are nearly identical to the more famous longer wheelbase 75 series Land Cruisers, but the frame and body is much shorter. This allows the Land Cruiser to be more nimble off-road. This model was popular as a personal off-road transport, but because the Land Cruiser was marketed almost exclusively as a commercial and government vehicle and because these were never sold in the US, few were built, compared to other Land Cruiser models.
However, these models were sold all over the world in the 1980s and early 1990s. They can be found in Japan, Asia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand and South America. The short-wheelbase models are not quite as common in Australia, but they are very popular in the homeland of Japan, where compactness and rugged 4x4 are a welcome combination. Today, few short-wheelbase 70 series can be purchased new—some are still in production today in some select South American countries and is still being produced by Toyota Auto Body at the Yoshiwara Plant in Toyota City.
For the North American market, the 70 series was only sold in small numbers. In 1984–1987 (model years 1985–1987), the BJ70 was sold in small numbers in Canada. Available engine choices were the 3B four-cylinder diesel engine or the later 13BT, a turbocharged variant of the 3B. The 1985 version had a 12-volt electrical system which was changed late-1985 production (for the 1986 model year) to a 24-volt system in the diesel powered versions to meet international NATO specifications for a 24V starting system.
, the 70 series models was still available in Canada, albeit accessible only to the mining industry. It was sold through Toyota Industrial Sales Canada, represented by vendors in Saskatoon, Sudbury, North Bay, and Quebec. The 70 series was not offered for sale in the United States.
, the updated long wheel base HZJ79 is available both as a cab and chassis, or as a completed GCC model with a box, ABS, airbags and available differential lockers.
Militarised variants.
Al-Thalab.
In 1999, UK-based engineering company Jankel entered into a collaborative venture with the King Abdullah Design and Development Bureau of Jordan ("KADDB"). The Jordan Light Vehicle Manufacturing (JLVM) joint-venture was an initial motor vehicle factory, to enable Jankel to reduce the cost of manufacture of its UK-engineered protective and light-combat vehicles. Soon after opening JLVM, Jankel began creating various up-armoured versions of the Land Cruiser 79 long wheelbase vehicle, and in 2000, secured a contract with the United Nations to provide protected versions of the Land Cruiser 79.
In 2000, Jankel began designing a Long Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV) to provide a capable and reliable patrolling platform. The Land Cruiser 79 chassis base was chosen as it is: common in most countries worldwide; not overly reliant on electronic management systems; mechanical components are of a basic design, enabling field repairs with standard automotive parts; a high-chassis weight loading capability; resulting in a vehicle which could be sustained in-field over long periods in remote areas, with limited or no support. Designed for patrol missions, internal security, reconnaissance and border patrol forces, it was field tested in the UK and Jordan, and first produced from 2005. The Al-Thalab can in base form accommodate up to four crew members, of equipment, and comes equipped with three firing bases, two base stations for radios and various power take-offs. There are options for: two stretchers in the rear for medical evacuation; medium range () and commando variants. Inspected in 2002 by QinetiQ, it was subsequently approved for sale to the UK Government. In 2004, the Jordanian Army made its first order, taking initial deliveries from 2006, and now has over 200 units. The Armed Forces of Mauritania have been operating the Al-Thalab LRPV since 2006. In 2016, British special forces were seen using the Al-Thalab in Syria.
Babcock GLV.
The Babcock GLV was unveiled in June 2023, first seen at Eurosatory. It uses the Land Cruiser 79 chassis as a basis.
Technamm Masstech T4.
The Technamm Masstech T4 is an unarmoured off-road vehicle used by the French Armed Forces. It is based on the Land Cruiser HZJ 76 and manufactured by the Technamm company from 2017 to 2018.

Neuland Colony

Neuland Colony (Plautdietsch: Nielaunt /ˈnilɔnt/) is a Mennonite settlement in Paraguay. After thousands of Plautdietsch-speaking Russian Mennonites fled the Soviet Union during the Great Trek of World War II, many were left displaced by the war. In response to this need, land in the Boquerón Department was purchased by the Mennonite Central Committee in 1947 and settled by these same Mennonite refugees from Europe. As of 2008, the colony had about 3,400 residents.
The site is near Filadelfia, the capital of Boquerón, and not far from neighbouring Presidente Hayes Department. Neuland is located within the Gran Chaco and features, among other things, a museum of colonization history and a monument commemorating the Chaco War.
The monthly newspaper "Neuland – Informiert und Diskutiert" is one of several German-language newspapers in Paraguay.
Etymology.
Its name, which means "New Land," reflects its founding by settlers of German origin. It is the youngest of the Mennonite colonies.
Climate.
The climate is tropical, with summer temperatures reaching up to 45°C (113°F) and winter lows of around 9°C (48°F). The average temperature is 25°C (77°F). The region experiences long periods of drought followed by torrential rains.
Geography.
The terrain is mostly flat, not exceeding 300 meters (980 feet) above sea level, with occasional undulations. These areas provide fertile land for agriculture and animal husbandry.
It is close to Filadelfia, the capital of Boquerón Department, and not far from Presidente Hayes Department. Neuland is located within the Gran Chaco.
History and tourism.
It has a Museum of the History of Colonization and a monument commemorating the Chaco War (1932–1935).
The monthly "Neuland informiert und diskutiert" is one of several German-language newspapers in Paraguay. In May, the Rodeo Neuland takes place.
The Professional School Neuland receives support from the Ministry of Agriculture of Bavaria, Germany. Many technicians are trained there and subsequently apply their knowledge in the region.
The district includes Fort Boquerón, where the first decisive battle of the Chaco War took place on September 29, 1932. A statue, designed by Hermann Guggiari, stands at the site. Visitors can also appreciate exhibits about the beginnings of the colony and the work of the first settlers of Neuland.
The Public Relations Department of Cooperative Neuland is developing an educational tourism program to showcase ethnic interactions, historical battle sites from the Chaco War, nature reserves, and the region's flora and fauna. The program also includes stays with locals and other tourist attractions. Visitors can explore the rich and diverse flora and fauna of the Chaco during their tours of the area and nature reserves.
The Chaco ecosystem is very sensitive, so mass tourism is not recommended. Instead, ecotourism is encouraged as an educational approach.
Amistad Park is maintained in the same condition as the Chaco was 60 years ago.
Cooperative Neuland, aware of the growing tourist interest in the area and recognizing the importance of improving infrastructure to accommodate visitors, is steadily working to implement attractive projects.
Transportation.
It can be reached from Lagerenza by taking a detour from Route PY09, also known as Ruta Transchaco, to Cruce Pioneros at km 413, and then continuing along a road in very good condition.
Education and culture.
In Neuland, culture and education are highly valued, with music and song standing out among the major art forms. The prestigious Youth Symphony Orchestra features musicians instructed by international artists. In 1993, the music education center was established to train future musicians and organize rehearsals and presentations of works, including classical music and folk traditions from various cultures that converge in the region.
The Joy Choir is composed of people with certain ailments or those recently integrated into society, as well as seniors. It serves as both therapy and a form of distraction. In hospitals, the choir provides encouragement to patients in difficult situations. The choir was established based on the recommendation of doctors at Hospital Neuland.
Another major concern for Neuland is education. The first settlers prioritized education even before building their houses. Often, classes were held in the shade of trees. For the settlers, education was considered the best investment they could make.
Regarding infrastructure, primary and secondary educational institutions are equipped with modern classrooms, laboratories, and workshops for practical work and testing. Education is compulsory until ninth grade. Students from schools and colleges in the villages and town center are transported by a school bus managed by the Cooperative.
Regarding university education, the Cooperative awards scholarships for studies in Asunción or abroad to individuals who have completed their university studies. Recipients are expected to contribute to the community by providing development assistance upon completing their education.
Training is also a key focus for Neuland. Vocational training institutions have been established to prepare individuals for various professions, including farming, dairy farming, carpentry, mechanics, secretarial work, and accounting. Additionally, there are teacher training programs that prepare future educators to teach in primary schools across the country.
Economy.
After overcoming several challenges, Neuland has become a thriving community. It is an agricultural area where peanuts, cotton, sorghum, and sesame are grown. It is also an important region for livestock production, including cattle for meat and dairy.
Health.
The Concordia Neuland Hospital is equipped with modern facilities, including operating rooms, a pharmacy, and ambulances, providing comprehensive care for patients.
Members of the Cooperative have the option to join a health insurance plan through the hospital. The hospital has staff on call to attend to patients.
The hospital also offers guidance in health, education, family matters, spirituality, and services for the disabled, orphans, adolescents, and those who are ill.
As the Mennonite colony progressed, there was migration of the indigenous population to the colonies, where they receive education, medical care, and economic support.

John Gibbs (Virginia politician)

Lt. John Gibbs was an American settler and member of the Virginia House of Burgesses.
John Gibbs was born in England with a large family and spent some of his life in the country. He arrived on the ship "Supply" at Jamestown. The Virginia House of Burgesses was the first elected lower house in the legislative assembly in the New World established in the Colony of Virginia in 1619. It would meet once annually in Jamestown, similar to the British Parliament. Over time, the name House of Burgesses came to represent the entire official legislative body of the Colony of Virginia, and later, after the American Revolution, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Gibbs was a Representative from Captain Warde's Plantation along with Captain John Warde at the first House of Burgesses meeting, in Virginia, held in the choir of the Church of Jamestown.
John Gibbs survived the indian massacre of 1622 and was listed in the 1624 census as a resident of Jordan's Journey, VA.

Bifora

The bifora or "pifara" was a Sicilian double reed instrument of the oboe family, related to the ancient shawm and particularly to the piffero of the northern Italian Apennines. Much larger than the piffero, and made in one piece, it was employed together with drums in ceremonial processions, particularly in the town of San Marco d'Alunzio in the province of Messina. Its use seems to have died out during the twentieth century.

Sligo Creek Trail

Sligo Creek Trail is a paved hiker-biker trail running along Sligo Creek in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Most of the trail passes through tree-filled parkland. The trail and surrounding park is a popular place for locals to jog, walk, bicycle, roller-skate, and take their children to the playground. Many local families enjoy picnicking at one of the 15 picnic areas along the trail.
History.
The trail and the Sligo Creek Parkway have their origins in 1927 with the establishment of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, which was charged with creating a park system in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC. Plans for the Sligo Creek Parkway were developed in 1929 and land acquisition started the next year, aided by the Capper-Crampton Act of 1930. Construction of the road occurred in three phases between 1930 and 1954.
The first section of the road, between Park Valley Road and Colesville Road, opened on September 1, 1934, with a parallel bridle path that was later paved to make the trail. Originally there was to be a narrow road on each side of Sligo Creek—an East and West Drive—and a bridle path in-between them. Actual construction resulted in one, wider road on the West Drive alignment south of Maple Avenue and on the East Drive alignment north of there. The bridle path meanwhile was built primarily on the alignment of "East Drive" south of Maple and on the bridle path north of it.
The section of trail from Piney Branch Road to Riggs Road was built in the 1990s, opening in June 1997, as a community amenity to allow for the construction of a storm sewer reclamation project by the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. This section was aligned to follow the path of the storm drain through the narrow valley in the vicinity of the Fall Line.
After the trail was paved trail bridges over the creek were either added or upgraded, with most of them built in 2001 and installed between 1994 and 2002, though about nine bridges predate this work. In some places, the trail was moved as bridges have been relocated, recreational facilities have been added or altered, or the course of the stream has changed.

FIBA EuroCup Challenge

The FIBA EuroCup Challenge was the 4th-tier level transnational professional continental club basketball competition in Europe, organised by FIBA Europe. However, it was Europe's 3rd-tier level club basketball competition in its inaugural 2002–03 season.
The competition was founded in 2003, following a conflict between FIBA Europe and ULEB during the 2001–02 season, as an attempt by FIBA to expand their secondary tournament held during the previous season, the FIBA Europe Regional Challenge Cup, by merging it with the FIBA Europe Champions Cup. 
Each season's finalists were promoted to the next season's more prestigious 3rd-tier level competition, the FIBA EuroChallenge. The competition ultimately ceased in 2007.
History.
In 2002, FIBA Europe abolished its two main club tournaments, the FIBA Saporta Cup and the FIBA Korac Cup, and invited European teams to join their two newly formed competitions, the FIBA Europe Champions Cup and the FIBA Europe Regional Challenge Cup, which would function as FIBA's premium and secondary-tier tournaments, respectively, in an attempt to compete against the newly formed EuroLeague, already run by ULEB since 2001. 
However, the revived Champions Cup never became a true rival to the ULEB Euroleague, and FIBA therefore decided that a pan-European competition, on top of the previous season's regional competition, would be organised for the 2003–04 season. The FIBA Europe League was launched in 2003, as its top competition and the FIBA Europe Champions Cup ultimately merged with FIBA's second-tier tournament, the FIBA Europe Regional Challenge Cup, to form the FIBA Europe Cup, which instead functioned as FIBA Europe's second-tier tournament, and the fourth-tier overall on the European pyramid. 
The competition was played during the 2002–03 to 2006–07 seasons. It was variously known as the FIBA Europe Championship Cup / FIBA Europe Regional Challenge Cup (2002–03), the FIBA Europe Cup (2003–05), and the FIBA EuroCup Challenge (2005–07).
Overall during those five seasons, several historic European clubs played in the competition, such as ASK Riga, Fenerbahçe, Split, Khimki Moscow Region, EKA AEL, Bayer Giants Leverkusen, Azovmash Mariupol, PAOK Thessaloniki, Hapoel Jerusalem, Rytas, Ventspils, Ural Great Perm, Belenenses, Academic, UNICS Kazan, Prokom, Dinamo Bucharest, Benetton Fribourg, etc.

Watir

Watir (Web Application Testing in Ruby, pronounced water), is an open-source family of Ruby libraries for automating web browsers. It drives Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari, and is available as a RubyGems gem. Watir was primarily developed by Bret Pettichord and Paul Rogers.
Functionality.
Watir project consists of several smaller projects. The most important ones are watir-classic, watir-webdriver and watirspec.
Watir-Classic.
Watir-Classic makes use of the fact that Ruby has built-in Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) capabilities. As such it is possible to drive "Internet Explorer" programmatically. Watir-Classic operates differently to HTTP-based test tools, which operate by simulating a browser. Instead, Watir-classic directly drives the browser through the OLE protocol, which is implemented over the Component Object Model (COM) architecture.
The COM permits interprocess communication (such as between Ruby and "Internet Explorer") and dynamic object creation and manipulation (which is what the Ruby program does to the "Internet Explorer"). Microsoft calls this "OLE automation", and calls the manipulating program an "automation controller". Technically, the "Internet Explorer" process is the server and serves the automation objects, exposing their methods; while the Ruby program then becomes the client which manipulates the automation objects.
Watir-Webdriver.
Watir-Webdriver is a modern version of the Watir API based on Selenium. Selenium 2.0 (Selenium-Webdriver) aims to be the reference implementation of the WebDriver specification. In Ruby, Jari Bakken has implemented the Watir API as a wrapper around the Selenium 2.0 API. Not only is Watir-Webdriver derived from Selenium 2.0, it is also built from the HTML specification, so Watir-Webdriver should always be compatible with existing W3C specifications.
Watirspec.
Watirspec is executable specification of the Watir API, like RubySpec is for Ruby.

The Golden Slipper

The Golden Slipper () is a Russian fairy tale collected by Alexander Afanasyev in "Narodnye russkie skazki".
It is Aarne-Thompson type 510A, the persecuted heroine.
Synopsis.
An old man brought back two fish from the market for his daughters. The older one ate hers, but the younger asked her fish what to do with it. It told her to put it in water, and it might repay her; she puts it in the well.
The old woman, their mother, loved her older daughter and hated her younger. She dressed up the older to take to Mass, and ordered the younger to husk two bushels of rye while they were gone. She wept beside the well. The fish gave her fine clothing and sent her off, husking the rye while she was gone. The mother came back talking of the beauty they had seen at Mass. She took the older daughter again, leaving the younger to husk three measures of barley and the younger went to Mass again with the fish's aid. A king's son saw her and caught her slipper with some pitch. He found the younger daughter and tried the shoe on her; when it fit, they married.
The Golden Slipper story has similarities to the story we know as “Cinderella”. The old woman in the story treating her oldest daughter good and leaving the youngest behind. The youngest being able to talk to the fish she was served at dinner, taking it to the well to live because the fish ask her to let it live. The old woman was taking the eldest daughter to mass to pray and also find a husband. The old woman would make her youngest hither to stay home and husk some rye for the family. Hither who is upset by being left behind, goes out to the well and is greeted by the fish she saved. The Fish asked her why she was sad? Hither then told the fish what the old woman has been doing, he decided to help her with the rye, and she could go to mass. Hither was delighted and put on her best outfit and headed to mass, where she catches the attention of a handsome prince who is also attending mass. Needing the get home quickly before the old woman finds out she's been at mass the entire time. Leaving behind her shoe/slipper, the prince vows to find out who foot fits inside this slipper. He tracks the old woman down and asks her daughters to try the slipper on, the old woman insisted on just the eldest daughter, but the prince was stubborn and waited to see if Hither's foot was the one. Sure, enough it was, and they lived happily and prospered.

Freiston Shore

Freiston Shore is a settlement in the Borough of Boston, in Lincolnshire, England. It is in the civil parish of Freiston, and approximately east from Boston.
History.
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Freiston's sandy shore on The Wash was developed as a sea bathing resort. By the mid-19th century there were horse races and other attractions on the beach. However, the process of coastal accretion caused a salt marsh to develop, leaving hotels without customers. Since the mid-20th century, more marsh has been enclosed behind sea banks for use as arable land.
During the Second World War, defences were constructed around Freiston Shore as a part of British anti-invasion preparations of World War II. A number of pillboxes, gun emplacements and coastal lights were constructed. The remains of these fortifications can be seen today including a Ruck machine gun post, of a type once widespread in Lincolnshire.
Following the Second World War, land reclamation led to the village becoming inland by about half a mile. The original sea bank, with its pillboxes and some of the Freiston shore light railway, can still be seen. A direct path from the village to the marsh on The Wash still exists.
Sea defence policy.
In 2000 the process of land reclamation was reversed when part of the sea bank was deliberately breached, and the land behind opened to the tides as part of a policy of managed realignment. This took the pressure off the remaining sea defences with the aim of prolonging their life, while of tidal salt marsh was re-established to help soak up wave energy, this acting as a further sea defence.
Nature conservation.
This new marsh, together with another, designed to be managed as a brackish marsh with lagoons, now forms an RSPB reserve. Freiston Shore is home to pied avocets, common redshanks, ringed plovers, northern wheatears and marsh harriers in spring and summer. In the autumn and winter migrating waders such as common redshanks, ruddy turnstones, dunlins, and waterfowl such as dark-bellied brent goose and Eurasian wigeon, can be seen.

<doc id="7034173" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7034173" title="Ryhill">
Ryhill

Ryhill is a small village and civil parish situated on the B6428 road in West Yorkshire, England approximately north-east of Barnsley. It has a population of 2,628, increasing to 2,894 at the 2011 census.
Historically Ryhill is part of the West Riding of Yorkshire in the Wapentake of Staincross. The Wapentake almost corresponds with the current Barnsley Metropolitan Area, although a few settlements and townships within the Staincross Wapentake such as Ryhill were put outside the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley and now lie within the current West Yorkshire Metropolitan Area since April 1974.
Like many of the surrounding villages, it is still recovering from the effects of pit closures which has seen the demise of the many collieries which once surrounded the village. The local economy is currently enjoying a return to prosperity as new housing developments have made the village popular with commuters to nearby towns.
The first mention of Ryhill in recorded history is an entry in the 1086 Domesday Book which describes 'Rihella' as having 4 ploughlands and an area of pasturable woodland.
The name "Ryhill" itself is almost self-explanatory: it simply means "hill where rye is grown". Originating in Old English, the name is formed of the elements "ryge" and "hyll".
An alternative interpretation is for 'Ra', which refers to Roe Deer. 
Both of the interpretations seem feasible; the village itself has a long-standing history in farming, but the naming of surrounding connected areas poses an interesting possibility for Roe Deer, Wintersett immediately below Ryhill being a place to take livestock during the winter months, Nostell being a Roman stable, Newstead being grazing land, Cold Hiendley and South Hiendley also suggestive of clearings for livestock, possibly with connections to the larger settlement at Ringstone Hill, Brierley.
Mining.
There are historical accounts recorded of mining by monks at Nostell Priory just down the road from Ryhill going back 900 years and more, the area still shows several former bell pit sites on the road from Station Road, Ryhill through to Nostell. It is fair to surmise that mining for local use has also been active in Ryhill since settlement.
Ryhill Main Colliery was situated on West Fields, Ryhill and had a tramway that connected up to the Barnsley Canal, Old Royston junction of the Midland Railway and the Barnsley Coal Railway which ran through Ryhill. There was also a second pumping shaft situated at the bottom of Newstead hill.
The first sinking was opened by Henry Lodge Snr, a former weaver from Skelmanthorpe in 1874 to a depth of 324 feet, and taken over by his son Henry Lodge Jnr following his death in 1889, running through to 1922 when, after the stresses of consecutive strikes and spiralling costs of deeper shafts, safety regulations and mechanisation by its competitors, Ryhill Main closed.
During the sinking of July 1874 the sinkers fell short of blasting powder and a young lad called Edward Schofield was sent to Staincross to get some. On securing 16lbs of powder he put it in a bag and carried it over his shoulder on a stick. On his return to Ryhill he stopped off at the blacksmith's in Royston where a spark ignited the powder causing a huge explosion. Edward, the blacksmith Charles Pickard and his apprentice were all seriously burnt from the blast.
Mr John Sutcliffe was the original manager of the colliery when it opened.
In 1885 Mr Jonathan Isherwood was certified manager.
In 1887 Herbert Fisher was manager.
In 1908 Henry Lodge Ltd was managed by Henry Fisher and the under-manager Herbert Hall.
The main buildings in the yard were the wooden headgear, the winding engine house, the boiler house with its square bricked chimney and the fan house for ventilating the underground workings. A small steam driven power plant supplied the electricity. The fitters', the blacksmiths' and the joiners' shops were all combined into one building.
The early years of transport would have involved coal being carted by horse to the Barnsley Canal at Old Royston where a terminus with screens and chutes had been erected to facilitate the loading of barges. The original Royston railway station was situated here before being moved nearer Monckton Main at the bottom of Lund Hill.
A tramline was built to connect up to Notton Cut Barnsley railway and canal.
As the full tubs came off the cage they were coupled together and sent down the tramway, which ran through the fields, to the Midland Railway sidings and the Barnsley Canal coal dock at Old Royston.
A cinder cart track would have run direct to Ryhill station.
Spoil from the pit was carted away to make roads around the district.
On 26 May 1884, at about 6 pm a fire was discovered in the underground engine house. The engine was fed with steam from the surface and sat on a wooden foundation, it was used to draw coal from the deep workings to the bottom of the shaft. 30 Men and 21 horses and ponies were in the pit at the time. Colliery manager, Mr John Sutcliffe, immediately set about rescuing the remaining men inside. Some men hearing of a fire rushed to get out and were unnecessarily scorched. The damage put 200 men temporarily out of work.
The pit employed 322 men in 1901 and 299 in 1918.
Smaller mines like Ryhill were usually passengers through many of the strikes with little by the way of incidents.
One such incident, on 2 August 1919, when the loyal workmen, volunteers and others, who were keeping the pumps going at Ryhill Colliery were about to go on duty, they were surrounded by a large crowd of strikers and prevented from resuming work. Fortunately there was no actual violence, the crowd adopted the "peaceful persuasion" method.
The demonstrators achieved their objective so the naval ratings were called upon to man the pumps.
Thirty men were at once dispatched to this pit. At this point in the strike there were 477 naval ratings attached to 22 collieries including New Monckton a few days earlier after 384 miners stormed it.
Other collieries Ryhill miners may have worked in over the years include Ellis Laithe, Havercroft Main, Hodroyd, Monckton Main 1,2 &amp; 6 also Royston Drift (Havercroft/Royston border), Monckton 3&amp;4 (Havercroft), Monckton 5 (Chevet), Nostell, Shafton, Wharncliffe Woodmoor 1 &amp; 2 (Carlton) 3 &amp; 4 (Grimethorpe), Sharlston, Fitwilliam, Hemsworth, etc. All within close proximity.

Forty Mile Point Light

Forty Mile Point Light is a lighthouse in Presque Isle County near Hammond Bay on the western shore of Lake Huron in Rogers Township, Michigan USA.
Unlike many Great Lakes lighthouses, Forty Mile Point Light does not mark a significant harbor or river mouth. Rather, it was constructed with the intent that as one sailed from Mackinaw Point to the Saint Clair River, one would never be out of viewing range of a lighthouse. The light is named because it is on 40 mile Point which is sailing distance from Old Mackinaw Point.
It is part of U.S. Coast Guard District No. 9.
History.
While the Presque Isle Peninsula had been lighted since 1840, and the entrance to the Cheboygan River fifty miles to the north had been lighted since 1851, the New Presque Isle Light's range of visibility of and the Spectacle Reef Lighthouse, exhibited the light for the first time on June 1, 1874 had a visible range of left an unlighted intervening stretch of coastline along which mariners had to navigate blind. In its annual report for the fiscal year 1890, the board recommended that $25,000 be appropriated for the construction of a new light and fog signal at Forty Mile Point near Hammond's Bay, at the approximate midpoint between the two lights.
Congress was unimpressed with the request and it was five years before it was approved and funded. The plan for this light is nearly identical to the one for the 14 Mile Point (Built in 1894 and the Big Bay Point Lighthouse( Built in 1896) both on Lake Superior . The penury of Congress concerning light stations on the Great Lakes was not limited to Forty Mile Point.
The footings are wood pilings, and the structure is made of red brick, the walls being made with 3 courses of brick, a 2" dead air space and one more course of brick. The integrated tower is square and high. The house contains two identical apartments (One for the keeper and one for the assistant keeper).
The light was completed in November 1896, but traffic on the Great Lakes is not a year-round event, so it wasn't until the spring (April 1) of 1897 that it was first lit. The station was automated in 1969 and is still operational. Markings are white with a black lantern. The original lens was a fourth order Fresnel lens designed and manufactured by Sauttier And Co. in Paris. It had six bulls-eye flash panels, and the clockwork would rotate it so that it would emit a white flash every ten seconds. This lens was transferred to the new Sand Hills Lighthouse near Eagle River on Lake Superior in 1919 The lens now in place is the second lens to occupy that position. It is a unique lens in that it was made up of parts from at least 3 different lenses. One panel was made by Henry-Lepaute of Paris in 1872. This new lens was a fixed lens with an internal rotating shield mechanism to make a characteristic of 15 seconds on and 15 seconds off. The current characteristic is 3 sec on 3 sec off. This is the last working classic lens on Lake Huron.
Current operations, maintenance, viewing and events.
During the Big Blow of 1905, twenty-seven wooden vessels were lost. The steamer "Joseph S. Fay" ran aground, and a part of its hull rests on the beach approximately north of the lighthouse. There is a Michigan historical marker honoring Forty Mile Light, there is a marker concerning the "Graveyard of Ships". The marker states:
The site is now a county park (well-marked) north of Rogers City on US 23, a/k/a the Sunrise Side Coastal Highway. A map with the lights in the area is available at lighthousesRus. The park is accessible from the highway—do not turn on to 40 Mile Point road.
The lighthouse anchors one end of a bike path, the Huron Sunrise Trail, that is near and sometimes in the right of way along US 23, and runs by Hoeft State Park and to Rogers City. The bike trail was completed in late May 2009.
The lighthouse is owned by Presque Isle County and the museum and gift shop are operated by the 40 Mile Point Lighthouse Society. The park grounds are open to the public year-round from 8.00 AM to sundown. The lighthouse is open for tours from the Friday before Memorial Day through mid October. Tour hours are Tuesday to Sunday 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. More information may be obtained from the Forty Mile Point Lighthouse Society at (989) 734-4907. or https://fortymilepointlighthouse.org
Importantly, the many structures that were part of the installation remain: lighthouse; Lighthouse keeper quarters; barn (bunkhouse)(renovated in 2006-2007 as the gift shop), foghorn signal building (the diaphone has been removed), oil house, and brick outhouse. The surrounding park also houses the wheelhouse of the first Calcite freighter.
The fourth order Fresnel lens is in place and in use, and access to the tower provides a view of it and the Lakeshore. The Fresnel lens is still operative, being one of only 70 such lenses that remain operational in the United States, less than sixteen of which are use on the Great Lakes of which less than eight are in Michigan.
There are many recurrent events at the lighthouse. A calendar is available. Half of the lighthouse is now a museum, the other half is caretaker's quarters. Membership of the 40-Mile Point Lighthouse Society is $20.00 per year.

This leads him to become suicidal. Charles goes on a drunken rampage and decides he is going to end his life in his old hometown, but when he misses the exit, he turns around driving down the wrong side of the highway causing an accident, he then jumps off of a water tower in his home town trying to kill himself again but it doesn't work. Benetto sees his mother, who had died eight years prior standing at the dugout on the field that he had landed on.
Benetto returns to his old family home, and spends one more day with his mother, where in a number of previously unknown factors related to his difficult childhood and troubled relationship with his father are revealed to him. His mother assists him in resolving his issues and getting his life back on track. The day ends when Benetto regains consciousness at the scene of the accident in a police officer's arms.
The book's epilogue describes how Benetto was inspired by his experience to quit drinking and reconcile with family, including his daughter, Maria, before his death five years later. At the end, Maria is revealed to have been the narrator of the story.
Reception.

Luis de Villanueva y Zapata

Doctor Luis de Villanueva y Zapata was a Spanish colonial administrator in New Spain.
Biography.
He studied at the University of Salamanca. He married Mariana de Sandoval, daughter of Pedro de Sandoval and Isabel Ortiz.
He was an "oidor" (judge) in the "Audiencia" of Mexico. "Visitador" (Inspector) Valderrama once suspended him from this office for abuse of power. 
On the death of Viceroy Lorenzo Suárez de Mendoza in June 1583, Villanueva y Zapata became acting viceroy of the colony in virtue of his position as dean of the Audiencia. This made him the royal official in charge of Spanish possessions north of Peru, including both present-day Mexico and Central America (except for Panama). This was a difficult period for the government, which had to combat a sense of insecurity in the colony. Villanueva served in this capacity through September 24, 1584, when the new viceroy, Pedro Moya de Contreras, officially took over the office. Moya de Contreras had been "visitador" at the time of the death of Suárez de Mendoza, and in this capacity he exercised considerable influence even before becoming viceroy.

Bad Penny Blues

"Bad Penny Blues" is a fast instrumental blues written by Humphrey Lyttelton and recorded with his band in London on 20 April 1956.
Popular success.
It was originally released as Parlophone ER 4184 and became a hit record in Britain at the time.
It was the first British jazz record to get into the Top Twenty, and stayed there for six weeks. Its success was due to the catchy boogie piano riff, played by Johnny Parker and brought to the front by producer Joe Meek. Paul McCartney based his piano part for the Beatles' song "Lady Madonna" on this riff.
The official producer of the record was Denis Preston, who employed Meek as engineer. George Martin was head A&amp;R man of Parlophone at that time, but was not involved in the actual recording.
"Bad Penny Blues" was featured in Mike Figgis' film "Red, White &amp; Blues" and is on the soundtrack CD of that film.
It was a popular and regular feature of Lyttelton concerts, sometimes played with accompanying riffs by the band. It was recorded again by Lyttelton with Elkie Brooks in 2002, with lyrics added, on their album "Trouble in Mind".

John Bowers (diplomat)

John Bowers (November 27, 1912 – October 11, 2004) was a British diplomat and head of fundamental education at UNESCO for 20 years from 1947. He was the architect of UNESCO's activities worldwide in literacy and adult education.
John Bowers was the son of Basil Bowers, headmaster of Cheltenham College Junior School, and was educated at Cheltenham College and Trinity College, Oxford.
While still at school, he took up an interest in bird photography and had pictures published in "Country Life".
After postgraduate courses in Arabic, Islamic Culture, Anthropology and Law, he joined the Sudan Political Service in 1935. Three years later, he married Sheila Tinson, with whom he lived among the Dinka people of the southern Sudan. One night his tent was shredded by a Lion—though at the time he was not in it.
During World War II he was seconded to the Sudan Artillery Regiment, based at Kufra oasis. Later he fought in Ethiopia with the Upper Nile Scouts and in the Libyan desert, where he was badly wounded. An out-of-body experience during a subsequent operation gave Bowers a lifelong interest in mysticism. He was private secretary to Lord Moyne, the British Minister Resident in the Middle East, who was murdered by the Stern Gang in 1944. Following the war he joined UNESCO, at the request of Sir Julian Huxley, where he worked in adult education, agriculture and literacy in Africa, India, South-East Asia and Central America. Bowers was a vigorous supporter of the Third World through the United Nations. He inducted qualified educationists including Mushtaq Ahmed Azmi, a pioneer in the field of adult education in India, to UNICEF.
In 1952, representing UNESCO, he spoke at the Dartington conference which proved to be a major event in the history of the British studio pottery movement. Bernard Leach, one of the leaders of this movement, recorded that Bowers's comments about crafts and development in "backward areas" generated controversy among African participants.

Fragmentary Annals of Ireland

The Fragmentary Annals of Ireland or Three Fragments are a Middle Irish combination of chronicles from various Irish annals and narrative history. They were compiled in the kingdom of Osraige, probably in the lifetime of Donnchad mac Gilla Pátraic (died 1039), king of Osraige and king of Leinster. A major narrative within the text is the so-called "Osraige Chronicle" (as proposed by Radner) which greatly focuses on the exploits of the ninth century king of Osraige, Cerball mac Dúnlainge, who was the paternal ancestor of the medieval Mac Giolla Phádraig family.
The "Fragmentary Annals" were copied in 1643 for the Rev. John Lynch by Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh from a lost 15th-century vellum manuscript, which belonged to Giolla na Naomh Mac Aodhagáin (Nehemias MacEgan). Mac Aodhagáin, who died around 1443, was a professor of Irish Brehon Law in Ormond. The sole surviving manuscript of the "Fragmentary Annals", which is currently held by the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels, is not in Mac Fhirbhisigh's hand, but in that of an anonymous scribe, who made a fair copy of Mac Fhirbhisigh's text, adding some marginal comments of his own and an index. The manuscript (MS. 7, c. n. 17) is incomplete and includes five fragments of annals beginning in 573 and ending in 914. What has survived joins the synopsis of the hypothetical Chronicle of Ireland.
Little is known of the lost exemplar from which Mac Fhirbhisigh worked. He appears to have modernized the orthography of the original text as he copied it. There are lacunae in places where the exemplar could no longer be read due to its poor condition. Mac Fhirbhisigh's copyist added dates, which he took from the "Annals of the Four Masters" without troubling to confirm their accuracy or correct them where they were clearly in error.
The first fragment relates mainly to the Northern Uí Néill and may have been compiled in Ulster, but the remaining fragments were evidently compiled in Osraige (Ossory), a kingdom which corresponded approximately to the later County Kilkenny and western County Laois. The original compiler evidently drew upon a variety of sources, some of which (e.g. annals) were probably more accurate and trustworthy than others (e.g. long bardic works). The fragments combine cold annalistic records with romantic tales and extravagant flights of fancy in a manner that is unique among the Irish annals.
Two modern editions of the "Fragmentary Annals" have been published:

Oddworld Inhabitants

Oddworld Inhabitants Inc. is an American video game developer founded in 1994 by special-effects and computer-animation veterans Sherry McKenna and Lorne Lanning. The company is primarily known for the "Oddworld", series of video games about the fictional planet of Oddworld and its native creatures. The series debuted with ' in 1997 and continued with ' in 2001 but the studio has also developed standalone titles ' in 1998 and ' in 2005.
Oddworld Inhabitants took a break from game development for a time following the release of "Stranger's Wrath". During this period, the company focused on other endeavors, such as film development. However, its main project, a movie called "Citizen Siege", was never released.
The company returned to the video game industry with UK-based developer Just Add Water, resurrecting the Oddworld franchise with remasters of existing titles and developing new ones. A remaster of the studio's first game, developed by Just Add Water, called ' was released in 2014. It was followed up by ', released on April 6, 2021.
History.
Founded in 1994, Oddworld Inhabitants came from a partnership between Lorne Lanning and Sherry McKenna. McKenna was initially not very receptive to the idea of making video games, believing them to be "ugly and confusing." Lanning returned to McKenna with three and a half million dollars that he borrowed based on his 3D expertise, and they moved from Hollywood to San Luis Obispo in September 1994, where Oddworld Inhabitants was started.
Video game development (1997–2005).
"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee" (1997).
The first game from Oddworld Inhabitants, Inc. was 1997's "", a 2D side-scrolling platform game published by GT Interactive for PlayStation and PC. It proved to be a commercial and critical hit, sold 3.5 million units, made $180 million and won nearly 30 industry media awards. The game tells the story of Abe, one of 100 mudokon creatures enslaved by industrialist glukkon creatures in a meat-processing plant called RuptureFarms on the planet Oddworld. The company developed the A.L.I.V.E. (Aware Lifeforms in Virtual Entertainment) game engine for the title.
"Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus" (1998).
After the success of "Oddysee," publisher GT Interactive pressured the company to make a sequel for the PlayStation by Christmas 1998. In order to make this happen, Oddworld Inhabitants broke from the second game of its original planned quintology, "Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee", and focused on a new game. In order to complete the game in nine months, "Abe's Exoddus" was developed using the same engine, and added improved gameplay, a quicksave system, more cinematic sequences, and more intricate backgrounds. 
"Abe's Exoddus" released in 1998 for PlayStation and PC, continuing the story where "Oddysee" left off using elements that were left out of its predecessor due to time constraints. Abe is sent on a quest by his deceased ancestors to destroy the mega factories that produce Soulstorm Brew—a product made from the bones of dead mudokons, and rescue 300 of his kind, discovering an even deeper connection to his spiritual past along the way.
"Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee" (2001).
The studio's third game was "Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee", a 3D platform game developed with the upgraded A.L.I.V.E 2 engine and published by Microsoft Game Studios exclusively for the Xbox console. It was the studio's first 3D title. In the game, Abe returns to assist Munch, whose species has been fished to extinction by the Vykkers because their eggs are a delicacy marketed as "gabbiar" for the dominant species on the planet. Munch seeks to find the last known can of gabbiar eggs in order to revive his species.
On October 23, 2000, Microsoft secured exclusive rights to publish and distribute the next four Oddworld Inhabitants titles, beginning with "Munch's Oddysee" the following year. The development of "Munch's Oddysee" came after the decision by Oddworld Inhabitants to shift from the PC and PlayStation to Microsoft's Xbox console after development for the PS2 proved too difficult. The Xbox also had superior graphics capabilities that could withstand dozens of characters moving and interacting on screen at the same time with an evolving environmental landscape in the background.
Lanning later explained that the transition from 2D to 3D proved difficult for the team. The team working on "Munch's Oddysee" was the same team that produced "Abe's Oddysee" and "Exoddus", and thus they had no experience in 3D game development. Three months from release, the team realised that development was not going to be completed in time, so new programmers were brought in and re-wrote the entire game. 
"Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath" (2005).
For their fourth game, Oddworld Inhabitants developed "Stranger's Wrath", a first-person shooter set in the Oddworld universe, but without the studio's mascot Abe. Previously titled, 'Oddworld Stranger: Wrath of the Wild,' the game features shifting perspectives between first-person and third-person. The player assumes the role of Stranger, the last of a seemingly extinct species called the Steef.
"Stranger's Wrath" was released in January 2005, published by Electronic Arts exclusively for Microsoft's Xbox console. Despite the game being well-received by critics, it was not commercially successful, selling only 600,000 units. According to Lanning, EA games "sabotaged" "Stranger's Wrath" with its decision not to market the game.
Exit from video game industry (2005–2009).
The "Stranger's Wrath" marketing issues between Oddworld Inhabitants and EA Games left Lorne Lanning with a cynical view of the video game industry and how publishers treat development studios when they don't own the IP. EA made an offer to buy Oddworld Inhabitants, which Lanning and McKenna rejected.
After the release of "Stranger's Wrath", Lanning initiated a case to audit the publishing deal his company maintained, with respect to royalties, and it was discovered that there were "millions and millions of dollars of error not in our favour," and chose to give EA an ultimatum of paying the money or giving back 100% of his company and all its associated IPs—EA chose the latter. However, ditching its publisher meant the loss of finances for game development, marketing, and distribution. Without being able to fund it themselves, Oddworld Inhabitants could not continue to produce games. At the time, the studio had begun work on a new game called "The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot". 
In April 2005, Lanning announced the studio's decision to cancel all projects and leave the video game industry. While Oddworld Inhabitants had started out creating video games, the company always intended to expand into other media, including film. Lanning and McKenna closed the company's internal game production in San Luis Obispo and began looking at business models beyond that of the standard publisher/developer model. The aim was to fund the development of IPs on a range of media wider than just video games.
Oddworld Inhabitants worked on several projects during this time, including a CG feature film entitled "Citizen Siege", an online video game tied into the film, called "Wage Wars", and an HD machinima series. "Citizen Siege" was first announced by Lanning in October 2006 during his keynote speech at GameCity in Nottingham, UK. The film was to be directed by Lanning, executive produced by McKenna, and produced by Vanguard Films. It was described as a dark, political, action thriller with elements of sci-fi set in a universe separate from Oddworld. In the film, humans have been reduced to a mere commodity, where healthy human tissue is used as collateral against financial debt, allowing corporations to literally repossess people piece-by-piece. The hero of the story, now encased in a cheap life-support system, sets out to reclaim the pieces of his body and take down the organisation responsible for his own harvesting, crossing economic borders with the aid of unworldly powers fused to his mechanical body. 
According to Lanning in a September 2007 interview, "Wage Wars" was expected to be an online game—the first of two to help promote "Citizen Siege". The idea was to develop "Wage Wars" and "Citizen Siege" simultaneously "so that both the linear and interactive elements can launch together." When the studio decided to make the "Citizen Siege" film, it had a $40–60 million budget and were given the green light for an R-rated CG animated feature. However, the 2008 financial crisis made publishers even more risk-averse and it became even more difficult to get the project off the ground. Eventually, all the company's projects were put on hold.
During this time, Lanning also started a new venture, called Xmobb, along with McKenna, and Daniel Goldman (co-founder of the Total Entertainment Network) in Emeryville, California. Xmobb was described as offering social networking with video and gaming services. By August 2011, Lanning said the launch was a few months away, with patents filed under the business name Oddmobb, Inc., but at the Eurogamer Expo in September 2012, he revealed the failure of Xmobb. The associated websites have since been shut down.
Just Add Water partnership (2009–2015).
By 2008, Gabe Newell, co-founder of Valve, approached Lanning and McKenna to ase "Abe's Oddysee" and "Abe's Exoddus" on Steam. In June 2009, they met with UK game developer Just Add Water at the 2009 Game Developers Conference. 
Just Add Water's first release in partnership with Oddworld Inhabitants was the porting of 2005's "Stranger's Wrath" to Steam in 2010. "Oddboxx", a collection of "Abe's Oddysee", "Abe's Exoddus", "Munch's Oddysee" and "Stranger's Wrath" was released for PC in December 2010. The North American release was delayed due to publishing issues. 
This was followed by "Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD", a high-definition remaster, released digitally in December 2011 for PlayStation 3. The PC port was released in September 2012 and the PS Vita version came out that December. An Xbox 360 version was planned but ultimately scrapped due communication issues with Microsoft. Mobile versions of the game were released in December 2014. The next release was "Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee HD" for PS3 in December 2012. It was later ported to PS Vita in February 2014. 
The first new game to come from the partnership of Oddworld Inhabitants and Just Add Water was "", which was a reimagining of "Abe's Oddysee." The game was initially announced in January 2011, and was released on PlayStation 4 in July 2014. Releases for PC, Xbox One, PS3, Wii U, and PS Vita followed. The new game was made using Unity and featured 2.5D graphics.
In December 2015, Stewart Gilray revealed that Just Add Water would not be working on any new projects for Oddworld Inhabitants. No reason was given for their departure from the partnership. 
"Oddworld: Soulstorm" development (2016-2021).
In March 2016, Oddworld Inhabitants' press release revealed it has in-house development teams in the UK and California, and have partnered with developers Frima Studio in Canada to work on a new title, "Oddworld: Soulstorm", for a 2017 release. Though it was intended to be a remake of "Abe's Exoddus", it was later billed as a reboot of the sequel. Lanning built on the original release to make the story darker and more developed, adding elements like crafting
It was originally expected to release in 2017, but was pushed to 2018 and then again to 2019. In 2019, the game was delayed for a 2020 release at the Game Developer Conference in San Francisco when a new trailer was shown showcasing a cinematic from Soulstorm. The game was finally released to PlayStation 5, PS4, PC in April 2021. An Enhanced Edition of the game, which added new content and gameplay, was released in November and brought the game to Xbox Series and Xbox One consoles.
Games developed.
Unreleased games.
"The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot".
Originally coming from discussions about a sequel to "Stranger's Wrath", "The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot" is a standalone game, independent of the Oddworld Quintology, originally announced in an April 2005 issue of Game Informer. The story is set in the forested hills of Fangustan and follows Fangus, a shepherd who is forced to fight and become the savior of Oddworld when invaders arrive. Gameplay elements from other Oddworld games were expected to return. The game was to be released in 2006, with a Mature rating, and published by Majesco Entertainment for the Xbox before it was canceled.
In a May 2011 FAQ, an Oddworld Inhabitants representative confirmed "Fangus Klot" will be in future plans following "The Hand Of Odd" and "Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!" Stewart Gilray of Just Add Water has noted that there is a playable Xbox build of the game. Concept art was released in May 2013. In March 2014, Lanning revealed he has been designing the game himself for a year and a half and that if "New 'n' Tasty!" sells 500,000 units, Oddworld Inhabitants would finance "Fangus." 
"Oddworld: Hand of Odd".
Hand of Odd was conceived as an online, open world, real-time strategy game during the production of "Munch's Oddysee". Early information revealed its multiplayer aspects and its ability to be played from the perspective of Oddworld's indigenous mudokons or the industrial Glukkons. 
Ultimately, market conditions saw publishers lose faith in the RTS genre and Oddworld Inhabitants' own publisher was acquired by a risk-averse company, so the project was shelved. However, preproduction work on the game helped flesh out details of the Oddworld universe for future games. The game was thought to have been revived when Just Add Water announced plans for its development including launching a website with the original logo designed by Oddworld Inhabitants.
"SligStorm".
Oddworld Inhabitants briefly outlined an idea for a game that would have the player assume the role of an albino slig who is nearly killed by his brethren for being different. On May 9, 2011, an Oddworld Inhabitants released a list of FAQ answers in relation to future games, confirming "Sligstorm" will be worked on after "Abe HD" and "The Hand of Odd."
"Oddworld: Squeek's Oddysee".
The third game in the original Quintology following "Abe's Oddysee" and "Munch's Oddysee". The basic concept of the game revolved around Squeek, who has been forced to live within a robotic life support device after his body parts have been repossessed. The title was mentioned by Lanning as early as 1997, prior to the release of "Abe's Oddysee", and has been alluded to by Oddworld Inhabitants and Just Add Water over the years. In an FAQ on May 9, 2011, Oddworld Inhabitants confirmed "Squeek's Oddysee" would be worked on after "Hand of Odd", "Abe HD", "The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot," and "Sligstorm".
"Oddworld: Munch's Exoddus".
Expected to be a bonus game based on "Munch's Oddysee" outside of the original pentalogy, in the same way that "Abe's Exoddus" was to "Abe's Oddysee", plans for "Munch's Exoddus" evolved to become "Stranger's Wrath". It would have featured Munch traveling to a land named "Ma'Spa" to hatch the Gabbit eggs acquired from the original game. In 2013, Oddworld Inhabitants mentioned the game but confirmed it was not currently being worked on. It's generally believed that this game ultimately turned into "Stranger's Wrath".
"Oddworld: Slave Circus".
Lorne Lanning revealed plans for a game entitled "Oddworld: Slave Circus". It's believed that this was a reinterpretation of "Wage Wars" in the Oddworld universe.
"Stranger's Wrath 2".
The first mention of a sequel to "Stranger's Wrath" came on January 17, 2013 when Oddworld Inhabitants posted on its blog asking readers to vote on the preferred next title to be developed by Just Add Water—"Stranger 2" being one of the options. This game eventually became "The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot."
"Stranger Arena".
A competitive multiplayer game in the Oddworld universe that utilised the mechanics established in "Stranger's Wrath". Players would control multiple "Strangers" and battle head to head or in groups in multiplayer modes. It would also feature the ability to shift between third-person and first-person and include RTS aspects of defensive base building to combat players who focused on speed and accuracy. The game engine was initially built on the original Xbox system.
Reception.
Adventure Classic Gaming called Lanning "a legend in both the game and the film industries."
The "Oddworld" games have received more than 100 industry awards. "Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee" received more than 24 awards and three nominations from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences over 1997 and 1998.
In 1998, Oddworld Inhabitants combined the FMV cutscenes from "Exoddus" and submitted them to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as "Abe's Exoddus: The Movie" for Oscar consideration in the Animated Short category. The short did not win the Oscar.
In 1998, footage from "Abe's Oddysee" and "Abe's Exoddus" was used in the music video for Get Freaky by German electro-dance music project Music Instructor. Footage from "Munch's Oddysee" along with new CG animations of Abe and Munch were used in the music video for a European song called 'Use Yur Imagination' in 2002.
In 2010, "Game Informer" included Oddworld on the list of ten gaming franchises that should be revived, specifically counting for the return of Abe.
Oddworld's mascot Abe was planned as DLC for the PlayStation 3's All-Stars Battle Royale, but was later cancelled.
Due to Stewart Gilray's crowdfunding support during the development of "Thomas Was Alone", the creator named a game character after Abe from the Oddworld franchise.
Merchandise.
Lanning hinted at plans to release a game that involved action figures from the Oddworld universe in a pamphlet released at E3 in 1999. Called "Oddwars", Lanning still has all the material he created for the game and may release it in the future.
On 30 July 2007, the composer of "Stranger's Wrath", Michael Bross, released a soundtrack of music from the game.
Oddworld Inhabitants, in conjunction with book publisher Ballistic Publishing, released "The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants: The First Ten Years 1994 – 2004" in 2008, an art book featuring design concepts, paintings and in-game screenshots made between 1994 and 2004 during the development of "Abe's Oddysee", "Abe's Exoddus" and "Munch's Oddysee". The book came in four editions: hard cover, soft cover, leather-bound edition (limited to 1000 copies, each individually numbered and with a certificate of authenticity) and folio edition (limited to 100 copies, each individually numbered and with a certificate of authenticity).
On 9 November 2011, to promote the release of "Stranger's Wrath HD", a "LittleBigPlanet 2" costume was made available for purchase. An XMB Dynamic Theme of "Stranger's Wrath" was also released a few weeks later, followed by a LittleBigPlanet 2 costume of Munch on 30 November.
On 9 September 2011, clothing company Insert Coin announced they would be selling t-shirts from their website with Stranger's Wrath images to promote the impending release of the remastered game. Two different designs were manufactured based on locales within the game. Jonny Eveson has also released designs for an Oddworld-themed T-shirt based on "Abe's Exoddus". The design came in three colors. Oddworld Inhabitants uploaded the design to Qwertee seeking votes from the public to have the design accepted and put up for sale and on 1 April, the design was successfully added and put on sale for 48 hours.
In January 2016, Oddworld Inhabitants teamed up with publisher Limited Run Games for a one-off special release of "New 'n' Tasty!" on physical media if the publisher could reach 3000 followers on Twitter. On 18 January, Limited Run Games reached that goal and confirmed "New 'n' Tasty!" would be released on disc for the PlayStation Vita. On 29 March 2016, Limited Run Games revealed there would also be a limited edition physical version for the PS4. On 24 October 2016, Oddworld Inhabitants announced their second partnership with Limited Run Games to bring "Stranger's Wrath HD" to disc for the Vita platform only. The game was released on 9 December. On 9 February 2018, Oddworld Inhabitants announced their third partnership with Limited Run Games to release "Munch's Oddysee HD" on disc for the PS Vita. The game has been released on 23 February.

John Erskine of Cardross

Colonel The Honourable John Edmund Erskine (30 March 1662 – 13 January 1743), of Cardross, was a Scottish soldier and politician. His journal was printed in the nineteenth century. He was nicknamed 'The Black Colonel'.
His portrait can be found hanging at Culross Palace, a property in the care of The National Trust for Scotland in the Royal Burgh of Culross.
Background.
Born in Cardross, Scotland on 30 March 1662, a younger son of David Erskine, 2nd Lord Cardross, by his second wife, Mary Bruce, daughter of Sir George Bruce of Carnock. His father was a member of a cadet branch of the Earls of Buchan.
Career.
Erskine's strongly Presbyterian sympathies led him to choose the winning sides during the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the deliberations prior to the Act of Union of 1707.
He joined Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll's unsuccessful rebellion against James VII and II in 1685 and afterwards fled from Scotland to join the army of William of Orange, where he was given command of a Regiment of Foot. He landed in England with William's invading army in 1698, the beginning of the Glorious Revolution. In return for his service, he was given further commands in William's army, made governor of Stirling and Dumbarton castles.
He was an early investor in the Company of Scotland trading to Africa and the Indies, and, on 3rd April 1696, he was elected to the company's court of directors. He was actively involved in the management of the company and, in November 1696, he travelled with William Paterson to Holland and Hamburg in an attempt to raise additional capital and help further the continental business of the company.
Family.
Erskine was married four times. He married as his first wife Jane, daughter of William Mure of Caldwell, in 1690. After Jane's early death the same year he married as his second wife Anna, daughter of Sir William Dundas of Kincavel. They had six sons and a daughter. One of his sons was the great jurist John Erskine of Carnock, father to John Erskine DD, leader of the Evangelical Party in the 18th-century Scottish Church. After Anna's death in June 1723 he married thirdly Lilias, daughter of Sir George Stirling of Keir and widow of John Murray, in 1725. There were no children from this marriage. After Lilias's death in March 1729, he married as his fourth wife Mary, daughter of Charles Stewart of Duncarn, in November 1729. They had at least one son, Charles, who died unmarried. Erskine died in Edinburgh on 13 January 1743, aged 80. His fourth wife died in September 1772.

Trey Grayson

Charles Merwin "Trey" Grayson III (born April 18, 1972) is an American politician and attorney who is a member at Frost Brown Todd and a principal at CivicPoint. A former Secretary of State of Kentucky, Grayson was a candidate in the 2010 Republican primary to replace retiring U.S. Senator Jim Bunning, losing to Rand Paul, the Tea Party favorite. He later was the director of the Harvard Institute of Politics. Grayson also was CEO of the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce.
Early life, education, and law career.
A product of the Kenton County public school system, Grayson was inducted into the Kentucky Association for Academic Competition Hall of Fame for his achievements in the Governor's Cup and other academic competitions at Dixie Heights High School. He was a 1989 Governor's Scholar and later president of the program's alumni association.
Grayson graduated from Harvard University with honors in 1994 with an A.B. in government. He then returned to Kentucky, entering a JD/MBA dual-degree program at the University of Kentucky, where he was one of the first Kentucky MBA scholars and one of the first two Bert T. Combs Scholars, the College of Law's top scholarship.
After earning both degrees in 1998, he worked as an attorney with Greenebaum Doll &amp; McDonald and later Keating, Muething &amp; Klekamp, where he focused on estate planning and corporate law.
Republican activism.
Although a member of the Democratic Party during his collegiate years, voting for Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election, Grayson became a member of the Republican Party shortly after graduating, citing his conservative beliefs.
In 2005, he was selected for the inaugural class of the Aspen-Rodel Fellowships in Public Leadership, which recognize the nation's top young elected officials. In 2004, The Council of State Governments selected him to participate in the Toll Fellowship Program, and he was recognized at the 2004 Republican National Convention by United Leaders as a "Rising Star" in the Republican Party.
In 2004, Grayson became a member of the senior advisory committee to Harvard University's Institute of Politics. Grayson has been on a variety of advisory boards of several national, election-related organizations and the steering committee for the Campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools.
Grayson has had various national leadership positions, including chair of the Republican Association of Secretaries of State. A former NASS Treasurer, chair of the NASS Elections committee, co-chair of the NASS Presidential Primary subcommittee, vice-chair of the NASS committee on voter participation, and NASS representative on the Council of State Government Executive Committee, he is also on the NASS standing committee on business services and the NASS executive committee. Through these positions, he has become a national authority on presidential primary reform and election administration.
Kentucky Secretary of State.
Grayson was elected Kentucky's Secretary of State in 2003. When he was sworn into office, he was the nation's youngest secretary of state, at 31. Grayson modernized the Office of the Secretary of State by bringing more services online, enhanced Kentucky's election laws through several legislative packages, and revived the civic mission of Kentucky schools by leading the effort to restore civics education.
During his first term, his office placed millions of images online and launched several new online services to eliminate bureaucratic impediments to starting a business or running for office. Grayson led a nationally recognized effort to increase the civic literacy of Kentucky's youth and helped change Kentucky's election laws, including a repeal of public financing of gubernatorial campaigns.
During his first term there was a controversy involving the State Board of Elections' purging of approximately 8,000 Kentucky voters from the Kentucky voter rolls because the voters had moved out of state. Grayson and the state board of elections were defendants in a lawsuit filed by then Kentucky Attorney General Greg Stumbo. A circuit judge ruled that the Board's actions were legal but asked Grayson to take additional steps to ensure voters would not be disenfranchised. Grayson later admitted to National Public Radio that the Office had made a technical mistake in purging some of the voters, but that the concept was important.
Grayson was reelected Secretary of State in 2007 by a 14-point margin. He became one of only two Republican statewide elected constitutional officers to win a second consecutive term in modern history 
In Grayson's second term, he launched new services that allow companies to start businesses online, reducing by several days the time it takes start a business in Kentucky. He also led the effort to modernize Kentucky's business laws, making it easier to start a business in Kentucky. His office was the first government entity in Kentucky to put its spending online so that taxpayers could hold his office accountable for how their tax dollars are spent. He also cut spending in his office by 15%.
Grayson supported a policy change made by Governor Steve Beshear that made it easier for some convicted felons to apply to have their voting rights restored. The Secretary of State's office is part of the technical process to restore voting rights, as the governor's paperwork is filed with the office. Grayson did not support automatic restoration of voting rights to all convicted felons.
Grayson administered the $37 million Kentucky received in federal funds to implement the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), as well the $169,755 grant from the Federal Election Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities (EAID). These funds allowed every Kentucky county to purchase a new machine for every precinct.
2010 U.S. Senate election.
Grayson ran in the 2010 Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Kentucky, losing to Rand Paul by a 23-point margin.
Endorsements.
Grayson was endorsed by Senator Mitch McConnell, former Vice President Dick Cheney, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, Senator Rick Santorum, Representative Hal Rogers, and several members of Kentucky's State legislature.
In late April, Focus on the Family founder James Dobson endorsed Grayson, saying he was the only candidate with the conviction to lead Kentucky. But a week later, Dobson rescinded his endorsement and endorsed Paul, claiming to have been misled by senior Republican officials about Paul's stance on abortion. Dobson did not claim Grayson was complicit in misleading him, but two days later Paul aired commercials claiming that Grayson and other GOP leaders "deliberately deceived one of America's leading conservatives, Dr. James Dobson." The ads were later removed.
Results.
Grayson lost to Paul by a 23.33% margin, with 124,710 votes to Paul's 206,812.
After conceding the election to Paul, Grayson said, "It's time to put all differences aside, unite behind Dr. Paul. He needs our help and I for one stand ready to serve". He downplayed the effect of the Tea Party's support for Paul, saying, "I think there are just so many things at work here, it's hard to pinpoint it. I think the tea party [vs.] conservative establishment thing is a little too simplistic."
Later career.
On January 7, 2011, it was announced that Grayson would resign as Secretary of State to accept a position at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He became the Director of the Harvard Institute of Politics. Governor Beshear named Bowling Green, Kentucky Mayor Elaine Walker as Grayson's replacement. Grayson's resignation became effective January 29, 2011.
At Harvard, Grayson oversaw many nationally recognized studies of political shifts between different blocks of voters, especially millennials. He was also a frequent moderator of school panels and lectures by many of the nation's top leaders.
In 2012, Grayson joined Gabrielle Giffords's "Gabby PAC" as co-chairman.
In April 2014, it was announced that Grayson would resign from Harvard University effective June 30.
On May 21, 2014, the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce announced Grayson would become the president and CEO of the organization, effective July 1.
In May 2017, the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce announced Grayson would resign as president and CEO effective June 9.
Later that year, in September, Frost Brown Todd announced that Grayson would joining its team as a member and a principal for CivicPoint, the firm's public affairs affiliate.
In June 2020, Grayson participated in the Transition Integrity Project, a group that considered scenarios for a contested presidential election in the fall. He continues to write opinion columns on subjects such as prioritizing economic development over "anti-LGBTQ stunts" and in favor of broader funding sources for election assurance.

Edmund M. Wheelwright

Edmund March Wheelwright (September 14, 1854 – August 15, 1912) was one of New England's most important architects in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and served as city architect for Boston, Massachusetts from 1891 to 1895.
Early life and career.
Wheelwright was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, educated at Roxbury Latin School and graduated from Harvard University in 1876. He studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later in Europe, after which he worked in the offices of Peabody and Stearns and of firms in New York and Albany.
In 1883, he started a business of his own and afterwards became a member of the firm of Wheelwright &amp; Haven, later known as Wheelwright, Haven &amp; Hoyt. The firm operated until c. 1930 as Haven &amp; Hoyt.
In 1893, Wheelwright and R. Clipston Sturgis were chosen by the trustees of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston to spend a year studying art museums throughout Europe; they later contributed to the ongoing design of the museum's building on Huntington Avenue.
Wheelwright, who designed the Harvard Lampoon Building, also oversaw the construction. It was first opened on February 19, 1909. Wheelwright while attending Harvard University was one of the founders of the "Harvard Lampoon". Wheelwright's design was inspired in part by an old church in Jamestown, Virginia, and by the Flemish Renaissance details of Auburn Street buildings in its vicinity.
He was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects, serving on its board of directors from 1892 to 1894 and 1898 to 1900, as well as a fellow of the Boston Society of Architects. He published two books on school architecture: "The American Schoolhouse" and "School Architecture."
Charles Donagh Maginnis had been his apprentice.
City Architect.
Wheelwright was nominated for the office of City Architect on March 30, 1891, by mayor Nathan Matthews Jr., the same day he fired the incumbent, Harrison H. Atwood. Wheelwright was confirmed by the city council on April 6, and for the next four years had control of all of the city's architectural work. Nonetheless Wheelwright believed that the city should be free to choose architects on a project-by-project basis, and after the election of Edwin Upton Curtis to succeed Matthews, advised him to abolish the office. The office was abolished later that year as part of a revision of the city charter, and Wheelwright returned to full-time private practice.
Wheelwright's most visible work as city architect was the former central fire station. In 1892, Wheelwright designed and built a 156 foot tall tower in the South End of Boston, Massachusetts, which was originally designed as part of this building and was used as a fire lookout. Since Wheelwright wanted the building to stand out, it was modeled after the 14th century Torre del Mangia in Siena, Italy, and made of brick like the Italian original. It is the city's only Florentine-inspired building. Since 1980, the building has housed the Pine Street Inn, a shelter for homeless people.
Personal life.
In June 1887, Wheelwright married Elizabeth Boott Brooks. His son was the poet John Brooks Wheelwright.
After suffering a nervous breakdown from overwork, he lived at a Thompsonville, Connecticut sanitarium for two years before dying on August 14, 1912, at age 57.
Architectural works.
Wheelwright designed the following:
In addition, he was a consulting architect for:
Legacy.
The Haven and Hoyt Collection at the Boston Public Library holds a variety of materials related to Wheelwright, including renderings and photographs.

Woburn Safari Park

Woburn Safari Park is a safari park located in Woburn, Bedfordshire, England. Visitors to the park can drive through exhibits, which contain species such as southern white rhinos, elephants, tigers and black bears. It is part of the estates of the Duke of Bedford that also includes Woburn Abbey and its deer park. The Safari Park itself covers .
Woburn Safari Park is a member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA).
History.
Woburn Safari Park was opened in 1970, established by the 13th Duke of Bedford and Jimmy Chipperfield on the grounds of his estate, Woburn Abbey. This was done as a means to help improve the financial position of the estate and restore the Abbey, which had fallen into disrepair as a consequence of the Second World War and relatively high post-war tax rates. The 11th Duke of Bedford had been president of the Zoological Society of London and had introduced various species such as American bisons, deers, antelopes, lions and tigers to the park.
Starting with upgrades to the wolf facilities in 2004, which allowed the wolves overnight access to the outside enclosure they share with the parks North American black bears, the park had spent about £4 million by 2010 to upgrade off-show animal facilities in the park. The African Ungulate Conservation Centre (or "Antelope House") was built in 2007 to help conservation efforts with hoofed mammals.
The Asian Elephant Conservation Centre, built to house the parks' Asian elephants, opened in 2008. It was followed in 2009 by a new facility for housing the Southern white rhinos and other hoofed animals, as well as an upgrade to the giraffe house that doubled its size.
Animals.
The park lets animals roam freely while visitors drive through their enclosures. The species held in the park include Southern white rhinos, elands, Scimitar horned oryxes, Addaxes, Gemsboks, Ankoles, Zebras, African wild asses, Asian elephants, Bactrian camels, North American bisons, bongos, African lions, Canadian timber wolves, North American black bears, and Barbary monkeys.
The park also has a leisure area featuring animal talks, petting zones, a gift shop, family restaurant and a Go Ape! course. Animals in the leisure park include lemurs, wallabies, rheas, penguins, goats, ponies, reptiles, red pandas, and marmosets. There is also a soft play centre called the Mammoth Play Ark and an outdoor adventure play area, Jungle Jamboree.
Road Safari.
The Road Safari is split into various sections, which house many species of animal, and visitors are able to drive around all five areas. The Northern Plains are home to Chapman's zebras, Brindled Wildebeests, North American Bisons, Przewalksi's horses, and Bactrian camels. Visitors can see these animals as they approach the ticket lanes at the entrance to the Park.
The Savannah Grasslands is located in 40 acres of grounds. Animals within this section of the Road Safari include Southern White Rhinos, Elands, Ankole cattles, Dwarf forest buffaloes, Ostriches, Grevy's zebras and Sable antelopes. Next, visitors can enter The Kingdom of the Carnivores, which sits amongst 71 acres, with animals within this section including Amur Tigers, North American black bears, Canadian timber wolves, and African lions.
In the warmer months, Giraffe Junction is home to Rothschild's giraffes, Blesbok, Scimitar Horned oryxes, Somali wild asses, and Addaxes. The African Forest houses Barbary Macaques; they share this enclosure with the critically endangered Eastern Mountain Bongo.
Foot Safari.
Once visitors have enjoyed the Road Safari section of the Park, they will naturally progress to the Foot Safari which is home to many smaller animals including Slender Tailed Meerkats, African Crested Porcupine, Asian Short Clawed Otters, four species of lemur which include Ring Tailed Lemurs, Black and White Ruffled Lemurs, Red Bellied Lemurs and Red Fronted Lemurs, as well as many other species.
Visitors can also enjoy animal talks and demonstrations throughout the day. These take place daily with many animals including Greater Sulphur Crested Cockatoo, Californian Sea Lions, Humboldt Penguins, Red pandas, Capybara, and even the Asian Elephants.
Conservation.
The park is committed to animal conservation and is involved in international breeding programmes to help save endangered species, and includes one of the world's largest hoofstock facilities - The African Ungulate Conservation Centre, as well as an Asian elephant facility.
The park manages the breeding programme for the Mountain Bongo, and has been one of the most successful breeders of the Rothschild's giraffe in Europe. Woburn Safari Park is also the only zoo in the UK to hold Vietnamese Sika Deer - a species extinct in the wild.
Woburn has won BIAZA's (British Association of Zoo's and Aquariums) for animal welfare for its management of Californian Sea Lions (2008) and Rothschild's giraffe (2004) as well as winning the BIAZA award for Education and Marketing in 2008.
Other features.
Woburn Safari Park is part of the Duke of Bedford's Estate and when combined with the acreage of the deer park which surrounds the safari park (home to the endangered Pere David's deer), it represents the largest ex-situ conservation facility in Europe and the first 'captive' breeding facility to rescue a species from extinction in the wild with its success with the Pere David deer. Woburn was also instrumental in saving the Mongolian Wild Horse.
Developments.
In 2010 the UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) criticised the park for keeping lions in overcrowded pens for up to 18 hours a day in winter, and keeping sea lions in chlorinated water. However, DEFRA acknowledged that the park was already working to correct these issues and praised other newer facilities within the safari park. Although a new, larger overnight facility for lions was already under construction and would allow outside access as well, Woburn Safari Park commented that even the old facility was large enough because the lions could move between the pens. Despite initial plans to move the sea lions to another park, the animals were retained and a new biological water treatment system installed. A new lion facility was completed in autumn 2010. A new tiger house was completed in 2013, with room for up to nine tigers.
Recent developments.
In 2017, a new enclosure called 'Farmyard Friends' was opened featuring sheep, goats, ponies, donkeys and pigs. The park welcomed red pandas for the first time in 2017, with their new enclosure Himalayan Heights being completed. A state-of-the-art Giraffe House opened to the public in 2018, giving visitors the opportunity to get up close to the Rothschild's giraffe herd all year round.
In 2019, new and upgraded animal housing was added to the camel and zebra paddocks. In addition, 2019 saw the opening of two new animal attractions, Alpaca Outpost and the immersive walk-through Land of Lemurs enclosure.
Criticism.
In March 2017, the safari park was criticised for neglectfully allowing the death of a peacock and failing to report the repeated escape of a monkey from its enclosure. A peacock was placed into isolation, but was forgotten about and not fed, leading to its death from starvation. A Barbary macaque fled its enclosure at Woburn Safari Park three times in one day, but remained inside the Bedfordshire zoo's grounds. Born Free Foundation head of animal welfare Chris Draper claimed there was "a systematic deficiency in the current system of zoo inspections across the board".
In January 2018, a fire claimed the lives of thirteen Patas monkeys. According to the safari park’s website, the monkeys had in which to roam but were confined to their house at night-time during the winter. The Captive Animals’ Protection Society said the fire showed the dangers animals were exposed to in zoos, Nicola O’Brien, a campaign manager for the charity, said: “It’s just one of the risks of having animals trapped in cages. It must have been an absolutely horrific death for them. Obviously accidents do happen, but we do think it calls into question the whole point of why we place animals in captivity in the first place".
Railway.
There is also a gauge railway, the "Great Woburn Railway". In 2011, it was free to use by Safari Park customers. It takes guests on a tour to Alpaca Outpost to see the alpaca herd and around to Elephant Junction in the Foot Safari.
It is a single-track line that consists of one near-circular loop.

WRKT

WRKT (104.9 FM, "Rocket 105") is an active rock radio station in Erie, Pennsylvania. The station is owned by iHeartMedia. WRKT's studios are located in the Boston Store building in downtown Erie while its transmitter is located near NE Sherman Road and Miller Road in Chautauqua County, New York. It plays both old, new, and next rock songs plus an array of sports.
History.
The station signed on in 1970 as WHYP-FM. Owned by James D. Brownyard, it was a simulcast of then sister station WHYP (now WZTE) 1530's Country Music format. WHYP and WHYP-FM were sold to Rambaldo Communications in 1989. On June 22, 1989, at 12:00 p.m., WHYP-FM became WRKT as "Rocket 101" at , for 28 years before moving up the dial to and rebranding as "Rocket 105" at 12:00 p.m. on October 20, 2017. The final song as "Rocket 101" was "Free Bird" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, while the first song as "Rocket 105" was "For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)" by AC/DC. The 100.9 frequency was to be reallocated to Westfield, New York, and sold at auction. Rick Rambaldo, owner of WEHP, won the bid, but was late in getting his down payment sent to the FCC, leading to rejection of his bid. The frequency again went up for auction in April 2020 (later delayed to July 2021). Rambaldo held an agreement to restore the oldies format that had previously been on WZTE until 2017 had he won the auction. Rambaldo sold WEHP in 2019, but re-entered the 2021 auction, winning the bidding for the 100.9 license. In 2022, Family Life Network claimed that it had acquired the frequency and relocated the allocation back to North East as WCGE.
On March 27, 2019, Connoisseur Media announced that it would transfer WRKT, along with its sister stations in Erie, to iHeartMedia in exchange for WFRE and WFMD in the Frederick, Maryland, market from the Aloha Station Trust. The sale closed on May 20, 2019. Since the iHeartMedia ownership, the only remaining local air personalities on the station were Mojo McKay and Allan Carpenter. Although Mojo McKay would be later let go as part of the nationwide iHeartMedia layoffs in August 2024 and would be replaced by Rover's Morning Glory show. The remainder of Rocket 105's programming originates from the iHeartMedia Premium Choice lineup.
Notable past and present on-air personalities include Kris Earl Phillips, the original Program Director and architect of the "Rocket" format, Steve Bohen, Paul Spinley, Kevin August, Dave Sharp, Amy St. John, Ronnie "Ron Klinester" Kline, Mark O'Brien, Nat Massing, Mojo McKay, Allan "AC" Carpenter, Sammy Stone, Greg Mauz, Jeremy "Moose" Pierce, Woody, with Chris Rodler, and "Static 'Stat' Boy".

Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare

The Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN; "National Institute for Nuclear Physics") is the coordinating institution for nuclear, particle, theoretical and astroparticle physics in Italy.
History.
INFN was founded on the 8th of August 1951, to further the nuclear physics research tradition initiated by Enrico Fermi in Rome, in the 1930s. The INFN collaborates with CERN, Fermilab and various other laboratories in the world. In recent years it has provided important contributions to grid computing.
During the latter half of the 1950s, the INFN designed and constructed the first Italian electron accelerator—the electron synchrotron developed in Frascati. In the early 1960s, it also constructed in Frascati the first ever electron-positron collider (ADA - "Anello Di Accumulazione"), under the scientific leadership of Bruno Touschek. In 1968, Frascati began operating ADONE ("big" AdA), which was the first high-energy particle collider, having a beam energy of 1.5 GeV. During the same period, the INFN began to participate in research into the construction and use of ever-more powerful accelerators being conducted at CERN.
The INFN has "Sezioni" (Divisions) in most major Italian universities and four national laboratories. It has personnel of its own, but it is mostly the main funding agency for high-energy physics in Italy. University personnel can be affiliated with INFN and receive from it research grants.

Beni Prasad Verma

Beni Prasad Verma (11 February 1941 – 27 March 2020) was an Indian politician and a founding member of the Samajwadi Party. A prominent member of the Samajwadi Party, he later joined Indian National Congress and was elected on its ticket to Lok Sabha in 2009. In 2016 he rejoined the Samajwadi Party.

He served as the Union Communications Minister in Deve Gowda's cabinet from 1996 to 1998.
He was re-elected to the Lok Sabha in 1998, 1999 and 2004 from Kaiserganj constituency seat. In 2009, he was re-elected to the Lok Sabha from Gonda constituency in Uttar Pradesh state as an Indian National Congress candidate and on July-12-2011 was appointed the Steel Minister in Manmohan Singh Government.

Death.
Verma died on 27 March 2020. Political leaders including Narendra Modi, Keshav Prasad Maurya, Akhilesh Yadav and others shared condolences.
Views.
In 1997, Beni Prasad Verma criticized B. R. Ambedkar in a Lucknow rally by saying "Ambedkar did nothing else except create trouble for Gandhiji."
In December 2009 during a debate session in Lok Sabha, Beni Prasad had remarked former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as "man of low standard". In the same statement, Verma had also criticized L. K. Advani. This created serious agitation among BJP leaders protested immediately by shouting, they stalled parliament and demanded an apology and said it would boycott the Lok Sabha till Verma apologises. Verma refused to apologise for the statement.
In February 2012, during the Uttar Pradesh elections Verma dared EC to arrest him, saying quota for Muslims will be hiked. Verma said this while addressing a rally at Kaimganj in the presence of Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh and Union law and minority affairs minister Salman Khurshid.
Earlier, Khurshid created a controversy by stating that he would continue to speak on nine percent sub-quota for Muslims even if the Election Commission says it's against the guideline to promise such a thing during the elections.
On 19 August 2012 he made a remark in Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh that "With the increasing price levels, the farmers are benefitting. Dal, atta, vegetables have all become expensive. I am happy with this price rise. The more the prices rise the better it is for farmers," the minister said
On 15 October 2012, he made a controversial remark that "I believe Salman Khurshid could not have embezzled Rs 71 lakh. It is a very small amount for a central minister. I would have taken it seriously if the amount was Rs 71 crore." The Times of India said his statements are grossly ill-timed and ill-phrased.
On 13 December 2012, he opposed hanging of Afzal Guru. He said: "Do not hang Afzal Guru but give him life imprisonment".
In December 2013, when he asked about Kumar Vishwas standing against Rahul Gandhi in the election from Rahul Gandhi's home place Amethi he said, "what will he fight, how will he fight. He is nothing but a joker. There are so many jokers already, he can join them."
In 2014, he criticised the then PM candidate Narendra Modi by saying "We need a future prime minister, not a man-eater". An FIR was filed against Verma for this statement.
In 2016, he blamed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for assassination of Mahatma Gandhi and added that "When Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated, RSS workers were told in advance to keep their radio sets on for they will get to hear good news."

WQWK (FM)

WQWK (105.9 MHz) is an active rock FM radio station broadcasting in State College, Pennsylvania, United States. It is known as QWIK Rock. The station, owned by Jeffry and Mark Schlesinger, through licensee Schlesinger Communications, Inc., was founded by brothers C. Dean &amp; Sheldon Sharpless, doing business as Moshannon Valley Broadcasting. The current incarnation was formed after WQWK abandoned its active rock format for talk radio in 2008. On April 21, 2023, the station recaptured the WQWK call sign after a shakeup in the market which made it available. WQWK's tower is located in Sandy Ridge, south of Philipsburg.
Early years: as WPHB-FM.
This station was originally known as WPHB-FM, first signing on the air in 1989 from the studios of its co-owned AM station with the WPHB call sign. Both stations simulcast a classic country music format for approximately half of the broadcast day, with break-aways during the daytime hours for WPHB's more Christian-based programming.
In 1996, the Sharpless family sold both stations to local residents Cliff and Laura Mack, who changed the format of the FM station to modern rock. The station also adopted the new call sign WUBZ-FM and the "105.9 The Buzz" moniker. In 1999, the station moved its tower to provide a city-grade signal in State College. WPHB and WUBZ-FM were then sold a few years later to Magnum Broadcasting, which moved WUBZ-FM's studios to State College. WPHB, which was more of a local station serving Philipsburg and the Moshannon Valley almost exclusively, stayed in Philipsburg, where it remains today.
In 2006, WUBZ-FM changed its call sign to WJOW and switched to a country format branded as "Joe FM". Magnum Broadcasting's previously titled "106.9 The Surge", which broadcast to Renovo and Lock Haven, changed in February 2007 to simulcast "Joe FM" as well. Another change is that "Joe FM" started to mix in more Southern and classic rock hits with the country music to differentiate themselves from their main competitor in the State College area, Froggy 101. "Rock N' Country" was their motto.
On September 3, 2009, WJOW changed its format to active rock, branded as "QWiK Rock 105.9" under the WQCK call sign. The line-up featured Todd and Troy Craig in the Morning (Troy was the former PD from the defunct 103.1 QWK Rock), 6am - 10am, Drew Shannon 10am - 3pm, AJ 3pm - 7pm, Andy Robb 7pm - midnight and Glennie B 12am - 6am.
History of "QWiK Rock".
After leaving the marketplace when being shut down at 103.1 FM by Forever Broadcasting, the active rock format, branded as "Qwik Rock", returned to the airwaves on September 3, 2009, at 5 p.m. on a frequency owned by Magnum Broadcasting Inc. The station seeks to recreate the sound of the original Qwik Rock from years gone by and it even features some of the names and voices from QWK 103.1.
"Quick Radio" began "circa" 1969 as an underground/progressive rock station. The first sign that its format was about to change may have been toward the end of 1970, when it held a call-in contest entitled "Quick Radio Sells Out!"
In 1989, WQWK (then broadcasting on 96.7 FM with a Top 40/CHR format) had a frequency switch to 97.1 FM. Shortly thereafter, the station format flipped to classic rock and the slogan changed to become "Lion Country's Home of Rock n' Roll". Today, classic rock is available with WBUS.
In 1993, then-WQWK owner TMZ Broadcasting acquired WIYQ (now WRKW) in Ebensburg from the Allegheny Mountain Network. TMZ dropped WIYQ's satellite-delivered oldies format to simulcast WQWK's programming over WIYQ, which took the call sign WQKK and the "Quick Rock" moniker.
In 2004, WQWK moved to 98.7 FM.
In 2006, WQWK moved to 103.1 FM, which was previously held by WBHV-FM.
When Forever Broadcasting took the station off-air in favor of talk radio, the WQWK call sign was moved to Forever's ESPN 1450, most likely just in case they ever decided to resurrect the station at a later date, but Magnum decided they could relaunch the station without its heritage calls and so one month to the day after the station went silent, it was reborn in a new spot on the dial.
Effective August 31, 2020, Magnum Broadcasting sold WQCK, two sister stations, and a translator to Jeffry and Mark Schlesinger's Schlesinger Communications, Inc. for $1.05 million.
In September 2022, WQCK-FM1 was surrendered to the FCC
On April 21, 2023, the station reinstated the WQWK call sign as it had become available after a market shakeup whereby Seven Mountains Media, who'd acquired the former Forever Broadcasting stations, ceased use of it in the market.

Judith Zaffirini

Judith Pappas Zaffirini (born February 13, 1946) is an American politician serving as a Democratic member of the Texas State Senate from the 21st District, which includes her home city of Laredo in south Texas.
Zaffririni is the first female dean of the Texas Senate. Zaffirini has been named among the "Top 100 Most Influential Hispanics in the United States" by "Hispanic Business" magazine. Zaffirini is the first Mexican American woman elected to the Texas Senate.
Background.
A graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, Zaffirini studied two summers at Laredo Community College (then Laredo Junior College). In 1977, Zaffirini became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.
Elections.
In 1994, she won more than two thirds of the ballots cast in the general election against the Republican candidate, Fernando G. Cantu Jr. (1944–2016), 71,029 (68.5 percent to 32,624 (31.5%). In the Democratic primary held on March 4, 2008, Zaffirini was to have faced San Antonio attorney Rene Barrientos but Barrientos withdrew from the race. His name, however, remained on the ballot, and he did some advertising. Zaffirini won the nomination, 108,572 votes (78.6 percent); Barrientos, 23,262 (21.4 percent).
In the 2012 general election, Zaffirini handily defeated the Republican candidate, Grant Elliot Rostig (born c. 1958) of Lockhart in Caldwell County, a supporter of the Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2012, who was endorsed by the Republican Liberty Caucus. Zaffirini received 129,894 votes (67.6 percent) to Rostig's 56,032 (29.2 percent). The remaining 3.2 percent of the vote went to the Libertarian nominee, Joseph Morse.
Legislative tenure.
Zaffirini has a 100 percent voting record, having through 2013 cast more than fifty thousand consecutive votes since January 1987. She even once missed her son's graduation to maintain the record.
On January 9, 2007, Zaffirini became the second in seniority in the 31-member Texas Senate, of which she has been a member since 1987.
In 2011, Zaffirini voted against the state appropriations bill because it reduced funding for public education by $5.4 billion, including $1.4 billion for targeted programs, such as pre-kindergarten expansion grants, one of her favorite programs. In 2013, Zaffirini will push for the issuance of tuition revenue bonds to fund capital construction projects on state college and university campuses, including TAMIU in Laredo.
In 2012, Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst removed Zaffirini from the chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Higher Education in favor of Kel Seliger, a Republican from Amarillo. Instead Zaffirini chairs the Senate Committee on Government Organization. She will remain a member of the higher education committee under Seliger and will continue as the co-chair of the Oversight Committee on Higher Education Governance Excellence and Transparency. Zaffirini said that she will continue to influence higher education policy "but the only difference is that the gavel won't be in my hand."
In July 2013, Zaffirini joined her Democratic colleagues in voting against Republican-sponsored legislation which passed the Senate, 19 to 11, to reduce from twenty-six to twenty weeks of gestation the maximum time limit during which a woman can procure an abortion. Zaffirini, who is anti-abortion, describes the new law as not anti-abortion, per se, but one that limits a woman's access to health care and fails to address the question of unintended pregnancies. Zaffirini said that she does "not believe that an unborn child can feel pain at twenty weeks. Nevertheless that had nothing to do with my position. ..." Zaffirini said, "Like it or not abortion is the law of the land, and because it is we must insure that women have access to safe and legal abortions. If they do not, then they will resort to coat hangers and self-aborting and illegal abortions, and that is wrong." Opponents of the law, such as Senator Royce West of Dallas, vowed a court challenge.
On March 8, 2017, Zaffirini was the only dissenter in an eight-to-one vote of the Senate State Affairs Committee of the bathroom bill, Senate Bill 6, introduced by her Republican colleague, Lois Kolkhorst of Brenham and strongly pushed by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the Republican presiding officer of the Senate. The bill would require persons to use public restrooms corresponding to their genitalia at birth. Strongly opposed by business and athletic interests, the measure is now pending before the Texas House of Representatives. Opponents of the measure have put their hopes in Moderate Republican Joe Straus of San Antonio, the House Speaker, who is known to be lukewarm or even hostile toward the measure.
In the 2017 legislative session, Zaffirini claimed her greatest numerical success record yet. Of the 168 bills that she introduced, 108 (64 percent) passed. Lawmakers introduced 6,631 bills but sent fewer, 1,211 (18 percent), to the governor than they have done since 1997 in the third year of the administration of Governor George W. Bush.
Zaffririni became the first female dean of the Texas Senate on December 30, 2023, when Sen. John Whitmire resigned.
Civil lawsuits.
In July 2013, Zaffirini was twice sued in Bexar County for alleged "gross mismanagement" of an estate valued at $150 million. The sisters, Josefina Alexander Gonzalez (1914–2014) and Delfina E. Alexander (died 2008), together owned about one thousand acres in South Texas. Between 1995 and 2002, five companies were organized to develop the property, but some of the businesses have long been inactive. The sisters further formed the Delfina and Josephina Alexander Family Trust designed to pass the proceeds of the holdings to Gonzalez's daughter, Rocio G. Guerra, and Gonzalez's two grandchildren. The second suit alleges that Zaffirini and two co-defendants, David H. Arredondo and Clarissa N. Chapa, committed tax fraud, forged documents, and paid themselves excessive fees in the amount of $420,000 for management of the Alexander holdings. The defendants are also accused of withholding money from the trust. Zaffirini's attorney-husband, Carlos Zaffirini Sr., said that Guerra and her children, have tried to break the trust on four occasions and that the basic issue centers on squabbling among the heirs over the collection of the money. Josefina Alexander Gonzales died in December 2014, five days before her 100th birthday.
In August 2016, the longstanding case was resolved without going to trial. Zaffirini delivered $35 million in cash and land to three Alexander family trusts that benefit Rocio Guerra, Zaffirini's second cousin, and Guerra's two children. The three are the sole heirs to the Alexander estate. In return, Zaffirini will take control of nearly 450 acres of undeveloped real estate off Del Mar Boulevard. Zaffirini will continue to serve as an executor and trustee of certain entities of the Alexander estate.
Criticism of Donald Trump.
On the occasion of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's visit to Laredo on July 23, 2015, Zaffrini wrote the lead column on the editorial page the next day in the "Laredo Morning Times" to question Trump's commitment to border issues.

Weapon storage area

Weapon storage areas (WSA), also known as special ammunition storage (SAS), were extremely well guarded and well defended locations where NATO nuclear weapons were stored during the Cold War era.
In most situations, the WSA or SAS areas were located inside the perimeter of an army barracks or an air base in NATO territory, but in a few cases they were located deep inside wooded areas and miles away from a military base.
Due to changes in the political landscape, the number of special weapons in Europe has been drastically decreased. Moreover, the introduction of the WS3 Weapon Storage and Security System has made WSAs obsolete.
At present, few WSAs are still operational as modern day special weapons are stored in the floors of concrete aircraft shelters and placed under 24/7 electronic surveillance.

Virginia State Route 53

State Route 53 (SR 53) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. Known as Thomas Jefferson Parkway, the state highway runs from SR 20 near Charlottesville east to U.S. Route 15 (US 15) in Palmyra. SR 53 connects the county seats of Albemarle and Fluvanna counties. The state highway also provides access to the community of Lake Monticello and Monticello, the estate of Thomas Jefferson. The route of SR 53 became a state highway in 1930; the highway receives its present designation in 1947.
Route description.
SR 53 begins at an intersection with SR 20 (Scottsville Road) a short distance south of SR 20's interchange with Interstate 64 in Albemarle County just south of the independent city of Charlottesville. The state highway heads east and begins to ascend Carters Mountain, which is part of the Southwest Mountains. Just west of Michie Tavern, SR 53 winds as it continues to its summit between Monticello to the east and Montalto, also known as the Mountaintop Farm and Patterson Mountain, to the west. A two-way ramp connects SR 53 with the Monticello access road, which passes over the state highway.
SR 53 has a few more curves as it descends the mountain to the hamlet of Simeon, where the highway intersects SR 795 (James Monroe Parkway). SR 795 leads south to the estate of James Monroe, Ashlawn-Highland. SR 53 crosses Buck Island Creek near its confluence with the Rivanna River before entering Fluvanna County. The state highway passes along the western edge of the suburban resort community of Lake Monticello, which is centered around the lake of the same name. The state highway reaches its eastern terminus at US 15 (James Madison Highway) just south of the U.S. Highway's crossing of the Rivanna River in Palmyra, the county seat.
History.
A small piece of SR 53, from the west end at SR 20 towards Monticello, was added to the state highway system in 1930 (along with SR 20 north to Charlottesville) as State Route 714; it became State Route 239 in the 1933 renumbering. In 1941, State Route 20 was extended north from Scottsville to Charlottesville via Blenheim and Overton, absorbing SR 239. SR 20 was shifted west to its current alignment in 1947; at the same time, current SR 53 was upgraded from State Route 642, and a short piece of old SR 20 became SR 53.

Siege of Limerick (1642)

The city of Limerick was besieged five times during the 17th century. Two of these sieges took place during the Eleven Years' War. The first of these sieges occurred during the spring of 1642 when Irish Confederate troops besieged and took the town's citadel, King John's Castle from an English Protestant garrison.
1641 Rebellion.
The Irish Confederacy’s taking of Limerick was made easier than subsequent attempts because they had the support of most of the city's population. About 600 English Protestant settlers had fled to the city to escape the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and had fortified themselves in King John's Castle in the centre of Limerick. They were led by Captain George Courtenay, 1st Baronet of Newcastle of Powderham in Devon. The city was predominantly Catholic and appealed to the new Confederate Catholic government at Kilkenny to capture this Protestant citadel.
Confederate troops arrive.
As a result, General Garret Barry, the commander of the Confederate Munster army, marched to Limerick with 1,500 men to secure it. As he had no siege artillery, Barry put his men to digging mines under the eastern curtain wall and the southeast bastion of the castle, which he intended to collapse by burning their supports. He also positioned snipers in the houses surrounding the castle to harass the defenders, particularly in St. Mary's Cathedral, which overlooked King John's Castle. Finally, he cut off the defenders' food and water supply.
Surrender.
After five weeks, when the English Protestants were ravaged by disease, they surrendered on terms, before Barry had to collapse his mines and assault the castle. The 400 surviving Protestants were evacuated to Dublin.

Comments of the Inner Chorus

Comments of the Inner Chorus is English band Tunng's second album, released in late May 2006 on Full Time Hobby Recordings in the UK. The songs "Woodcat" and "Jenny Again" were both released as limited edition singles.
A common theme picked up on by reviewers after the album's release is that of the pastoral and organic. The use of surreal lyrics ("I'll look for a man to turn me into a hare" on the song "Woodcat", for example) led to comparisons to The Wicker Man and Brothers Grimm
. The album, much like its 2005 predecessor "Mother's Daughter and Other Songs", has noticeable electronica influences leading many to bracket the album, and by extension Tunng, into the folktronica movement.
A limited edition version of the album was also released which contained two extra tracks: "Band Stand" and "Bodies".
Music videos.
Music videos were made for "Woodcat", "Jenny Again" and "It's Because... We've Got Hair".

4th Battalion, 14th Marines

4th Battalion, 14th Marines (4/14) was a United States Marine Corps reserve artillery battalion. It comprised three firing batteries and a headquarters battery. The battalion was based in Bessemer, Alabama and equipped with the M198 Howitzer with a maximum effective range of 30 kilometers. They were part of the 14th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division.
The battalion's mission was to provide artillery support to a maneuver element or reinforcing fires to another artillery organization.
History.
4th Battalion, 14th Marines started as a direct support artillery battalion utilizing the M109A3 (SP) Self Propelled Howitzer, then transferred all 18 M109A3SP's to the Army and converted to the M198 towed howitzer. The battalion was the last Marine Corps unit to use the M109A3 SP Howitzer.
Headquarters Battery and Lima Battery, both based in Bessemer, AL, were disbanded about 2007. Concurrent with this was the formation of the 4th Anti-Terrorism Battalion, an infantry unit, headquartered in Bessemer.
Kilo Battery was reassigned as a HIMARS Battery and reassigned to 2nd Battalion 14th Marines. Mike Battery was reassigned to 3rd Battalion 14th Marines, and has since transitioned to the M-198's replacement, the M-777 lightweight 155mm howitzer. Mike Battery was activated again in 2007 for a 2008 deployment to Iraq.

Ken Davy

Kenneth Ernest Davy (born 1941) is an English businessman. He is the owner and former chairman of the rugby league club Huddersfield Giants and former chairman of football club Huddersfield Town. He stood for Parliament as a Conservative Party candidate in 1970 and 1974, and again in 2019.
Career.
Davy grew up in Filey on the East Coast of Yorkshire. He left school at 15 with no academic qualifications and worked as a photographer for P&amp;O. At 21 he set up a commercial photography business in Huddersfield before joining Abbey Life in 1971. In 1979 he formed the independent financial advice company DBS, which he sold in June 2001, for £75 million. In 2003, he set up SimplyBiz, providing development, research and marketing services to financial advisers.
In 2011, he gave his views on the changes happening in the financial services industry "Restricted advice will prove much less attractive than many organisations believe. I can see why life insurers would be attracted to it, because it is a way of increasing their profits, but it does nothing for consumers or advisers." However, he later launched a national Restricted (rather than Independent) advice firm - "Sandringham Partners" in 2012, backed by £2m from SimplyBiz. He was made an OBE in the New Year's honours list in 2024/25.
Huddersfield Giants.
In 1996, Davy took over as chairman of Huddersfield Giants rugby league club. In 1999, he merged Huddersfield Giants with Sheffield Eagles, a move which resulted in the formation of the Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants. It was an unpopular move with supporters, and after one season the club reverted to being the Huddersfield Giants.
During Davy's chairmanship Huddersfield Giants went from being a Second Division club to a Super League force, competing in semi finals and finals. The club were promoted to the Super League in 1998, and despite being relegated in 2001, the team came straight back up in 2002 and won the 2002 Northern Ford Premiership remaining unbeaten throughout the league season and playoffs, and winning the Buddies Cup. Only 4 years later, Huddersfield Giants played St. Helens in the 2006 Challenge Cup Final at Twickenham Stadium, London. It was the first time that Huddersfield had reached the final since 1962. That was followed up with another Challenge Cup Final appearance, this time losing to Warrington Wolves at Wembley Stadium in 2009, a third cup final appearance under Davy's stewardship was secured in 2022 when the Giants emphatically beat Hull Kingston Rovers 25-4 at Elland Road to book a place in the final at Tottenham.
In 2013 the Giants won the League Leaders Shield, after a 40–0 victory over Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, It was the first time a Huddersfield team had topped the table in 81 years. They were also Challenge cup semi finalists in 2004 and 2012 losing to St Helens and Warrington again, respectively, as well as making the Super League playoffs semi finals in 2010, 2013 and 2015.
Huddersfield Town.
Davy led the successful consortium, out of three interested, that took over Huddersfield Town in 2003, when they were in administration following the collapse of ITV Digital and Town's recent relegation to the Football League's bottom tier. As part of the takeover Huddersfield Town's 40% share in the ground was transferred to a holding company, Huddersfield Sporting Pride Ltd. Huddersfield Sporting Pride Ltd holds a 60% stake in the Huddersfield ground with the combined original stakes of the football and rugby club, the other 40% stake is owned by Kirklees Council.
In September 2006, he was criticised for failing to offer Town a significant transfer budget for the 2006–07 season to enable the club to build on their play-off position of the previous season. The budget, which was unspecified, was (according to former manager Peter Jackson) already used up on signing just two players, goalkeeper Matt Glennon and striker Luke Beckett despite the release of several players. However, Davy stated that Jackson was given the opportunity to strengthen his squad in order to mount a drive for promotion. This was not utilised and Jackson's "inability to attract key players" was one of the reasons given by Davy for the manager's dismissal.
After Huddersfield's 2–3 loss to Yeovil Town on 16 September 2006, he addressed a peaceful demonstration of around 100 Town fans who had called for him to up the transfer budget or go, because of Town's poor start to the season in Football League One, in which they only picked up nine points from the first nine games.
On 3 June 2009, he handed over the chairmanship to Dean Hoyle and, after a brief period of retaining a minority shareholding, relinquished all ownership in Huddersfield Town.
He has been awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Business Administration from the University of Huddersfield and an Honorary Fellowship of the Chartered Insurance Institute.

On weekends, WRAW carries "In the Garden with Ron Wilson", "At Home with Gary Sullivan", "Rich DeMuro on Tech", "Bill Handel on the Law," "The Weekend with Michael Brown, Armstrong &amp; Getty" and "Sunday Night with Bill Cunningham". Most hours begin with an update from Fox News Radio.
History.
WRAW is one of the oldest radio stations in Pennsylvania. It signed on the air in September 1922. In the 1960s and 1970s, the station had a Top 40 format. During the 1980s, it played a syndicated adult standards format, known as "The Music of Your Life".

Another radio station in Reading, WEEU, discontinued airing Rush Limbaugh's nationally syndicated show in a cost-cutting measure stemming from its parent company's bankruptcy and sale.

Marvin Lipofsky

Marvin Bentley Lipofsky (September 1, 1938 – January 15, 2016) was an American glass artist. He was one of the six students that Studio Glass founder Harvey Littleton instructed in a program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in fall 1962 and spring 1963. He was a central figure in the dissemination of the American Studio Glass Movement, introducing it to California through his tenure as an instructor at the University of California, Berkeley and the California College of Arts and Crafts.
Education and teaching career.
Lipofsky was raised in Barrington, Illinois, where his family owned a department store. In 1962, he earned a BFA in Industrial Design from the University of Illinois, and he went on to earn both an MS and an MFA in Sculpture from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1964. There he studied under Harvey Littleton, the founder, with assistance from Dominick Labino, of the Studio Glass Movement. He would introduce the concepts of the movement during his subsequent tenure as a Design instructor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught until 1972. During this time he was responsible for training many studio artists. Notable students of Marvin Lipofsky include John Lewis (b. 1942), Richard Marquis (b. 1945) and Jay Musler (b. 1947).
Lipofsky has been an instructor for seminars and workshops at art and craft schools, including the Pilchuck Glass School in Stanwood, Washington; Columbus College of Art and Design in Columbus, Ohio, Southwest Craft Center in San Antonio, Texas; Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle, Maine; Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem, Israel; San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco, California and the Art Department of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. As a visiting artist he has traveled widely in the United States and internationally to Israel, Spain, France, Bulgaria, Sweden, Finland, Japan, and the Netherlands. He died from complications of diabetes on January 15, 2016.
Founder and collaborator.
In 1967 Lipofsky founded the glass program at the California College of Arts and Crafts, which he headed for two decades. He was also a founder of the Glass Art Society (G.A.S.), serving as president of that organization from 1978 to 1980. Lipofsky was one of the first American glass artists to travel to Czechoslovakia, where a studio glass movement had arisen in the 1950s. This would prove to be the first of many trips he would take; he became well known for his journeys abroad and his collaboration with numerous glass artists around the world.
Work.
Many of Lipofsky's works are colorful "bubbles" of glass. Often semi-translucent they allow the viewer to examine their depths. He is best known for the organic form of his pieces. “His art is about the visceral and the gestural,” wrote Studio Glass connoisseur Dan Klein. “The forms are inspired by internal organs, intestines, breast, stomachs, brains; their colorful, mottled, crumpled, broken shapes and expression of turbulence and restlessness.” Lipofsky is well known for having devoted his career in glass to endless variations on the turbulent, broken bubble form. His work, in short, is about glassblowing and the ways in which a blown glass sphere can be opened, shaped and distorted. Corning Museum of Glass curator Tina Oldknow has written that she admires Lipofsky “for his devotion to material and form. His non-objective vessels break apart and rearrange the blown glass mass while retaining the breathy, ephemeral quality that is one of the medium’s most intriguing characteristics".
Awards.
Notable awards garnered by the artist include a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Art Alliance for Contemporary Glass in Chicago, Illinois in 2005 and a Masters of the Medium Award from the James Renwick Alliance, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC in 2003. He was named an Honorary Lifetime Member of the Glass Art Society (G.A.S.) in 1986 and a California Living Treasure in Sacramento, California in 1985. The artist was the recipient of two National Endowment for the Arts grants in 1976 and 1974.
Collections.
Lipofsky's work has been collected by many public institutions worldwide. In the United States his work can be found in the collections of the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York; High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Oakland Museum, Oakland, California; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City; Philadelphia Museum of Art and Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio. Overseas his work is in Glasmuseet Ebeltoft in Denmark; Frauenau Glass Museum (Sammlung Wolfgang Kermer), Germany; Museum Bellrive in Zürich, Switzerland; Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam, Holland; National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto, Japan and Hokkaido Museum of Modern Art in Sapporo, Japan.
Personal.

Granite, Montana

Granite is a ghost town in Granite County, Montana, United States, three miles east of the town of Philipsburg. Granite thrived as a silver mining town in the 1890s and is now completely deserted. The state of Montana maintains the mine superintendent's house and the ruins of the union hall as Granite Ghost Town State Park.
History.
In 1872, Eli Holland found a small quantity of high quality ruby silver in the area. A shallow shaft was dug, but later abandoned until 1877, when Charles McLure discovered some silver ore in the shaft. He later traveled to St. Louis to obtain the capital necessary to begin development of the mine.
Granite eventually grew to a town with more than 3,000 inhabitants. For the time period, there were many modern amenities, such as the large Miners Union Hall, a library, 18 saloons, brothels, a hospital and school as well as churches.
The Sherman Silver Purchase Act was repealed in 1893, drastically lowering the price of silver, and many residents left Granite, leaving only 140 residents a year later. Granite is currently entirely uninhabited.

Siege of Limerick (1650–1651)

Limerick, in western Ireland was the scene of two sieges during the Irish Confederate Wars. The second and largest of these took place during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1650–51. Limerick was one of the last fortified cities held by an alliance of Irish Confederates and Royalists against the forces of the English Parliament. Its garrison, led by Hugh Dubh O'Neill, surrendered to Henry Ireton after a protracted and bitter siege. Over 2,000 soldiers of Cromwell's New Model Army were killed at Limerick, and Henry Ireton, Cromwell's son-in-law, died of plague.
Ireton's first siege, October 1650.
By 1650, the Irish Confederates and their English Royalist allies had been driven out of eastern Ireland by Cromwell's conquest of Ireland. They defended the line position behind the River Shannon, of which Limerick was the southern stronghold. Oliver Cromwell himself had left Ireland in May 1650, delegating his command of the Parliamentarian forces in Ireland to Henry Ireton, who sent Hardress Waller to take Limerick. The town was defended by Hugh Dubh O'Neill with a remainder of the confederate Ulster army. When Waller's vanguard approached the town, the town counsel also accepted James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven with his royalist troops into town. On 9 September 1650, Waller summoned the town to surrender. Waller was joined by Ireton somewhat later. However, the weather was increasingly wet and cold and Ireton was forced to abandon the siege before the onset of winter. He therefore retreated to his winter-quarters at Kilkenny where he arrived on 10 November 1650.
June 1651, Ireton returns – Limerick blockaded.
Ireton returned the following year on 3 June 1651 with 8,000 men, 28 siege artillery pieces and 4 mortars. He then summoned Hugh Dubh O'Neill, the Irish commander of Limerick to surrender, but was refused. The siege was on.
Limerick in 1651 was split into two sections, English town and Irish town, which were separated by the Abbey River. English town, which contained the citadel of King John's Castle, was encircled by water, the Abbey river on three sides and the Shannon on the other, in what was known as King's Island. There was only one bridge onto the island – Thomond bridge – which was fortified with bastioned earthworks. Irish town was more vulnerable, but was also more heavily fortified. Its medieval walls had been buttressed by 20 feet (about 6 metres) of earth, making it difficult to knock a breach in them. In addition, Irish town had a series of bastions along its walls, mounted with cannon which covered its approaches. The biggest of these bastions were at St John's Gate and Mungret Gate. The garrison of the city was 2,000 strong and composed mainly of veterans from the Confederate's Ulster army, commanded by O'Neill, who had distinguished themselves at the siege of Clonmel the previous year.
Because Limerick was very well fortified, Ireton did not risk an assault on its walls. Instead he secured the approaches to the city, cut off its supplies and built artillery earthworks to bombard the defenders. His troops took the fort at Thomond bridge, but the Irish destroyed the bridge itself, denying the Parliamentarians land access to English town. Ireton then tried an amphibious attack on the city, a storming party attacking the city in small boats. They were initially successful, but O'Neill's men counterattacked and beat them off. After this attack failed, Ireton resolved to starve the city into submission and built two forts known as Ireton's fort and Cromwell's fort on nearby Singland Hill. An Irish attempt to relieve the city from the south was routed at the Battle of Knocknaclashy. O'Neill's only hope was now to hold out until bad weather and hunger forced Ireton to raise the siege. To this end, O'Neill tried to send the town's old men, women and children out of the city so that his supplies would last a little longer. However, Ireton's men killed 40 of these civilians and sent the rest back into Limerick.
Surrender, October 1651.
After this point, O'Neill came under pressure from the town's mayor and civilian population to surrender. The town's garrison and civilians suffered terribly from hunger and disease, especially an outbreak of plague. What was more, Ireton found a weak point in the defences of Irish town, and knocked a breach in them, opening the prospect of an all-out assault. Eventually in October 1651, four months after the siege had started, part of Limerick's garrison (English Royalists under Colonel Fennell) mutinied and turned some cannon inwards, threatening to fire on O'Neill's men unless they surrendered. Hugh Dubh O'Neill surrendered Limerick on 27 October.
The inhabitants lives and property were respected, but they were warned that they could be evicted in the future. The garrison was allowed to march to Galway, which was still holding out, but had to leave their weapons behind. However, the lives of the civilian and military leaders of Limerick were excepted from the terms of surrender. A Catholic Bishop Terence Albert O'Brien, an Alderman and the English Royalist officer Colonel Fennell (who the Parliamentarians said was a "soldier of fortune") were hanged. O'Neill was also sentenced to death, but was reprieved by the Parliamentarian commander Edmund Ludlow and imprisoned instead in London. Former mayor Dominic Fanning was drawn, quartered, and decapitated, with his head mounted over St. John's Gate. Three Woulfes were sentenced to death for their role in the defense of Limerick: the mayor and the head of the Franciscans were caught and executed. The third, Captain James Woulfe, escaped and eventually made his way to England. That Woulfe was the grandfather of General James Wolfe.
The cost.
Over 2,000 English Parliamentary soldiers died at Limerick, mostly from disease. Among them was Henry Ireton, who died a month after the fall of the city. About 700 of the Irish garrison died and an unknown, but probably far greater number of civilians – usually estimated at 5,000.

Battle of Cerro Corá

 
The Battle of Cerro Corá () was the last battle of the Paraguayan War, fought on 1 March 1870, in the vicinity of Cerro Corá, northeast of Paraguay's capital Asunción. It is known for being the battle in which Francisco Solano López, Paraguayan president, was killed at the hands of the Imperial Brazilian Army.
The Paraguayan War was dragging on for more than five years and, after numerous battles, the Paraguayan army had been reduced to the elderly, the sick and children. The battle of Acosta Ñu was the last major combat of the war, which from then on was restricted to occasional skirmishes in the final months of 1869 and beginning of 1870. During this period, the Count of Eu, the allied commander-in-chief, organized expeditions in search of Solano López, following the path his column had taken. Along the way, López's and Eu's men made the civilian population suffer, either because of alleged conspiracies against López, or because of the looting and mistreatment inflicted by imperial troops. On 8 February 1870, López and his column reached Cerro Corá.
Conditions in the camp were deplorable, with the five hundred people who accompanied López in extreme hunger. In Cerro Corá, one head of cattle was slaughtered a day to feed everyone. The defensive positions organized by López were deficient, and to this was added the weak armament present. Brazilian troops, with about 2,600 men under the command of general José Antônio Correia da Câmara, approached and surrounded the camp, without López's knowledge. On 1 March they attacked on two sides: from the front and from the rear. The two defensive points, on the Tacuara and Aquidaban streams, quickly fell and the assault on the camp lasted a few minutes, with the resistance dispersing soon after.
López was surrounded by the Brazilians and, after refusing to surrender, was wounded with a spear by corporal Francisco Lacerda, fleeing into the forest soon after. General Câmara followed him and found him close to the Aquidaban stream, where he again refused to surrender, being shot by João Soares. The facts surrounding his death are shrouded in disagreements and inaccuracies. The battle ended soon after, with about 100 Paraguayans killed, 240 captured and seven Brazilians wounded. Time has given rise to interpretations of López's figure, portraying him both as a cruel tyrant and as a great Paraguayan leader. Over the years, the name Cerro Corá would become part of Paraguayan culture, baptizing streets, buildings, a national park, in addition to being the title of a feature film from 1978.
Background.
The war.
The Paraguayan War was the largest armed conflict in South America, involving Argentina, the Empire of Brazil, and Uruguay against Paraguay. It began in November 1864, when Solano López ordered the capture of the Brazilian steamer "Marquês de Olinda", which was steaming on the Paraguay River and carrying the president of the province of Mato Grosso, Frederico Carneiro de Campos. In December of the same year, López ordered the invasion of this province. At the same time, the Paraguayan president coordinated military offensives that eventually led to the invasion of Corrientes, in Argentina, and the invasion of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil. This hostile act prompted the formation of the Triple Alliance, on 1 May 1865, between the invaded countries and Uruguay. The Paraguayan attack on Corrientes and Rio Grande do Sul proved to be a military failure, forcing López's troops to retreat into their territory, going from attacking to being attacked by Triple Alliance. In the meantime, the naval Battle of Riachuelo took place, in which the Imperial Brazilian Navy dealt a major defeat to the Paraguayan Navy that destroyed almost its entire fleet, imposed a naval blockade and isolated the country from the outside world.
On 24 May 1866, already in Paraguayan territory, the biggest pitched battle of the entire war took place, the Battle of Tuyutí, which involved about 55,000 men, 32,000 allies and 23,000 Paraguayans. In this battle the allies triumphed, but were close to being defeated, given the surprise Paraguayan attack. The latter suffered about thirteen thousand casualties. Months later, the Battle of Curupayty was fought, characterized as being the biggest allied defeat, with the loss of approximately four thousand soldiers. About two years later, the allies won an important victory at the Fortress of Humaitá. The site was a strategic point and its conquest allowed the occupation of the Paraguayan capital, Asunción, on 1 January 1869. After the occupation of the city, Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, the Marquess of Caxias, until then the allied commander-in-chief, deemed the war over and withdrew from the conflict. He was replaced by Gaston, the Count of Eu, who continued the last phase of the war, known as the Cordilleras Campaign. At this stage, the fighting took place against what was left of López's army: mostly sick, elderly and children, as evidenced at the Battle of Acosta Ñu.
The hunt for Solano Lopez.
The battles of Piribebuy and Acosta Ñu were the last two major clashes of the war. What was left of the Paraguayan soldiers who took part in them joined Solano López, before heading to the Hondo stream. From there, the column marched to the village of Caraguatay, where the Paraguayan president proclaimed it the fourth capital of the country. At this point, the numerical superiority of the allies allowed them to organize three columns, with the intention of flanking Lopez's column, reaching the three paths that led to Caraguatay. The first column, the 2nd Army Corps under the command of marshal Vitorino José Carneiro Monteiro, coming from Campo Grande, advanced along the trail of Caaguijurú, on the central path of the village. The second column, a mixed force of Argentines and Brazilians commanded by generals Emílio Mitre and José Auto da Silva Guimarães, advanced to the right of the first column. On the left marched the 1st Army Corps commanded directly by the Count of Eu. Dionísio Cerqueira, at the time an ensign in Vitorino's column, witnessed a scene, which he called a "horrible scene", when they approached the trail. Some Brazilian soldiers were found mutilated and hanged from tree branches, over bonfires that had charred their feet. According to Cerqueira, such a scene "filled the soldiers with indignation".
On 18 August 1869, general Vitorino's column reached the road at Caaguijurú where there were about 1,200 entrenched Paraguayans. A quick combat ensued, with the Brazilians motivated to avenge their fallen comrades; the Paraguayans suffered a complete defeat. Also in revenge, general Vitorino authorized the beheading of the Paraguayan officers who survived the battle, a little over 16 men. On the next day, the three columns reached Caraguatay, whose residents suffered at the hands of the Brazilian troops. By this time, López had already fled, crossing the Salladilo stream, near the Manduvirá river. In the village, the Brazilians were received by 80 women and children who managed to escape from a kind of concentration camp called Espadín, a place used by López to imprison the "destinadas", women who were accused of treason. The Count of Eu then dispatched a cavalry force there, under the command of colonel Moura; upon arriving at Espadín he found and rescued about 1,200 women and children in a state of misery. Upon learning of the presence of the Brazilians, the women were elated with joy, moved by their release. It was very common, in the search for Solano López, to find starving women, dressed in rags, who begged with outstretched hands for flour or meat.
The allies wanted to maintain pressure on López, with the goal of preventing the reorganization of his forces. Therefore, still on 18 August, the Argentine general Mitre sent a force of Brazilian cavalry to march in pursuit of López's column, with the general joining it the next day. That day they reached Manduvirá, advancing until they reached the Salladilo stream, joining the Argentine regiment San Martín, which was in the Paraguayan rear, but López had already moved from there. On 20 August, a small Brazilian force, under the command of colonel Carlos Neri, faced the rearguard of the Paraguayans in the Hondo stream, about 30 kilometers from Caraguatay, but decided to camp there along with the rest of Mitre's troops. The next day they advanced on the Paraguayans, but before attacking, general Mitre sent a note to the Paraguayan commander demanding their surrender within thirty minutes, under the guarantee that they would live and return home. But if they refused, even the eventual prisoners would be beheaded, causing surprise both for Solano López, who was outraged by the note, and for the Count of Eu, who said he had been unaware of the incident, due to the novelty of the content of the message. At the end of the term, the Brazilians found that the Paraguayans had taken advantage of the given time to flee.
During the escape, López began to discover alleged plots by his subordinates to kill him. On 27 August, three Paraguayan spies, colonel Hilario Marcó and 86 other soldiers were executed. On 7 September, the column camped near the Capiibary stream, where López ordered the death of a few more soldiers who supposedly were involved in the conspiracy. When passing through this route, the Brazilian troops found the bones and more than one hundred skulls of these Paraguayans. New battles took place between the Brazilians and Paraguayans on 21 September, in the town of San Isidoro (in the current district of Curuguaty) and on the next day, in Hurucuatí, near the town of San Joaquín, all won by the Brazilians, the latter being occupied by the troops. In pursuit of the remnants, captain Pedro Werlang reported seeing hundreds of dead people lying on the road, murdered because they were exhausted and sick. They were men, women and children, killed to avoid being captured by the Brazilians. In October, the 1st Brazilian Army Corps remained in Caraguatay and the 2nd Corps occupied San Joaquín. There were Argentine soldiers and some anti-López Paraguayans in both armies, but the Argentine forces withdrew, leaving only 800 men in that region. The few Uruguayan soldiers in Paraguay were camped on Cerro León. From then on, it was up to the Brazilians to capture Solano López.
On 26 September, the Count of Eu was having difficulties in maneuvering his army in pursuit of the Paraguayan president, due to constant supply issues, and in order not to let López escape through the interior, he divided his forces into small vanguards. One of these, under the command of Fidélis Pais da Silva, reached and captured the town of Curuguaty on the 28th. Meanwhile, a column of 2,600 men from Concepción, led by general José Antônio Correia da Câmara, guarded the Mato Grosso border to prevent López from crossing the Paraguay River to the right bank. López's column headed east towards the Maracaju Mountain Range at the end of December. In the first months of 1870, the Brazilians found out that López was in this region, heading towards Ponta Porã, then deviating towards Chiriguelo. From there, López and the few remnants of his army headed for Cerro Corá.
Cerro Corá encampment.
On 8 February 1870, Solano López and his column, consisting of about 500 people, including vice president Domingo Sánchez, generals Bernardino Caballero, Isidoro Resquín, Francisco Roa and José María Delgado, as well as women and children, all hungry and ragged, armed mainly with spears and swords, arrived at Cerro Corá, a place of dense forest and rocky outcrops, located 454 kilometers northeast of Asunción.
To the north, south and west was the Aquidaban river and the Aquidabá-nigüi stream, its tributary. The place chosen by López to camp was nicknamed the "circus of gigantic rocks" by one of his followers. Due to the particularity of its location, Cerro Corá was a region that favored defense, if this was carried out by troops in good condition; otherwise, it was a trap, as there were only two ways to reach the camp; the road that crossed the Tacuara stream and the Aquidaban river, in the northwest, and the road that came from Brazilian territory, passing through Bela Vista, Dourados, Capivari and Ponta Porã, ending in Chiriguelo in the southeast.
As soon as they arrived, López began preparations to set up camp. The places where the headquarters, most of the Rifle Battalion, the Escort Squadron, the troops and the carts should be established were chosen. Accommodation was extremely precarious, limited to huts for the entire camp. Parallel to this was the condition of the troops, most of whom were sick, in addition to being insufficient to form a secure a defensive perimeter. López was aware of this, even so he ordered a precarious protection for the place. He selected ninety men and two small calibre cannons to guard the Tacuara stream. He left another hundred men and some artillery pieces at the Aquidaban river, under the command of general Francisco Roa.
Hunger punished the few who were with López. Faced with this situation, on 12 February, general Bernadino Caballero and forty other men were ordered to cross the border with Brazil in order to steal cattle and horses from the Military Colony of Dourados. On another front, with the same purpose, sergeant major Julián Lara and twelve men were sent to the fields of Aquidaban, marching on foot. Due to famine, practically everything was used from the cattle, including their hides. One animal was slaughtered a day to feed the 500 people in the camp.
On 25 February, López met with his staff to debunk a rumor that he was going to flee to Bolivia. At this meeting, ribbons of fabric from the Amambay medal were given with the words: "Venció penúrias y fatigas" (You overcame hardships and fatigues). It was minted in gold and silver with diamonds and rubies. Such an award raised the troop's low morale a little. As had happened since the beginning of the conflict, the Paraguayan president had never communicated his war plans. Therefore, nothing corroborates the theory that López chose Cero Corá as the site of the last battle of the war. Still, it is recorded that the Paraguayan leader ordered the chiefs of the remaining columns to move there. Most of the columns disobeyed this order, allowing themselves to be captured or fleeing into the woods. Already in the final days of February, the 412 soldiers and officers, in addition to Solano López, found themselves surrounded, without knowing it, by the imperial troops of general José Antônio Correia da Câmara.
Imperial attack column.
On 18 February, an imperial column of 2,000 or 2,600 men, under the command of Correia da Câmara, was on the march near Bela Vista. Câmara learned that López's camp was on Cerro Corá from colonel Bento Martins. Such information was obtained through Paraguayan deserters and prisoners. Unlike López's men, the Brazilian column was very well armed, equipped and fed. In view of the information passed on by deserters, Câmara believed that the Paraguayan column was heading for Dourados, in Mato Grosso. The Brazilian general then planned a two-pronged attack: the bulk of the troops, under the command of Antônio Paranhos, would attack from the front, on the Concepción-Bella Vista-Dourados road, while Câmara would advance from the rear.
On 26 February, the imperial forces advanced towards the Paraguayan camp, with the information that these forces were in a deplorable state, that Solano López was not aware of their approach and that the defensive positions were weak. On 28 February, the troops camped on the Guazú stream, where the Paraguayan column had passed. From there, the final attack was organized.
Battle.
Capture of the defensive positions.
On 1 March 1870, at six o'clock in the morning, López was informed that the defense of the Tacuara stream had been attacked; this information was passed on to the defense of Aquidaban. The attack was confirmed by fleeing soldiers heading towards the central camp, shouting that the "negros" had arrived. In Tacuara, the imperial forces, under the command of lieutenant colonel Francisco Antônio Martins, attacked from the rear with bayonets, quickly capturing the artillery, which did not fire a single shot. The attack was successful due to advance information, coming from deserters in the camp, about where the attack would be most effective. Since there was no artillery fire, information about the loss of Tacuara took some time to reach López. He then sent ten men, under the command of lieutenant colonel Candido Solís, to see what was happening in that position, but they were massacred on the way. Due to their delay in returning, López entrusted the same mission to colonel Juan Crisóstomo Centurión and commander Angel Riveros. As soon as the order was given, shots were heard from the defense of Aquidaban, a few kilometers from Tacuara. Despite the defensive artillery fire, no Brazilians were hit and this position was also taken with ease.
Centurión and Rivera started to gallop towards Aquidaban, but turned back before they got there and informed López that the position too had been attacked. Faced with this situation, López met with his officers and discussed the action they should take: surrender or fight, the latter being chosen. López then distributed his forces throughout the camp and they headed seven hundred meters towards Aquidaban. At the moment when Centurión and Rivera informed López about the fall of the position, imperial cavalry reached Cerro Corá and surrounded the camp in a pincer movement, spearing and sabering whoever they found, closing the siege at the mouth of the Chiriguelo trail. There general Francisco Roa was fighting, being killed after refusing to surrender.
Attack on the camp.
The attack on the Cerro Corá camp lasted only 15 minutes. At noon, the imperial forces made up of cavalry and infantry, under the command of colonel João Nunes da Silva Tavares, advanced towards the center of the camp, meeting Solano López who was mounted on a horse, Juan Francisco Solano López, known as Panchito, who was López's 15-year-old son and was granted the rank of colonel, some officers and the battered rifle battalion. Even with little ammunition and guns, Centurión commanded a group of one hundred riflemen, organizing them in guerrilla tactics. López and other officers positioned themselves behind the riflemen. Upon entering the camp, the Brazilians found many soldiers, old, young, sick, almost naked and semi-unarmed, and stopped the attack.
The Paraguayan resistance received some encouragement from the presence of López and his officers. But during the aimless shootout, colonel Centurión was hit by a projectile that shattered his lower jaw, splitting his tongue in two. López then started to escape from his position at a short gallop, due to the swampy terrain, to the center of the camp, where his base was located, putting an end to the resistance that soon dispersed, thus ending the battle. Even after the silence of Paraguayan guns, imperial troops that still penetrated the esplanade of the camp killed any Paraguayan they reached, including those who had surrendered.
Death of officers.
During the escape of López and his family, the cart carrying his wife Eliza Lynch stayed behind, about three hundred meters away, and his son Panchito returned to escort her. At this moment, he was reached by an imperial cavalrymen and ordered to surrender by lieutenant colonel Francisco Antônio Martins. Even his mother urged him to surrender to the Brazilians, but he refused to do so. He started to fight with his saber, until he was hit by a bullet. At this point, after jumping and covering her son's body, Elisa Lynch is said to have exclaimed: ""¿Ésta es la civilización que han prometido"?" (Is this the civilization you have promised?), a reference to the allies' claim that they intended to free Paraguay from tyranny and bring freedom and civilization to the country. According to Paraguayan oral tradition, Panchito would have said ""un coronel paraguayo no se rinde, jamás" (a Paraguayan colonel never surrenders) before being killed.
Surgeon Estigarribia, who was wounded in the leg, was killed with a spear. Colonel José Maria Aguiar, also suffering the same wound, was beheaded two hours after the end of the fighting while trying to flee. Vice president Domingo Sánchez was pierced by captain Azambuja's spear, despite the protests of an Argentine soldier. He would have said: "Rendirme, yo? Jamás!" (Give up, me? Never!).
Remnants.
General Bernadino Caballero and his 54 soldiers were not in the camp during the battle. They had been sent to forage by López and crossed the border with Brazil, by the Apa river. The column of colonel Bento Martins was in his pursuit. On 4 April, the Brazilian forces found and attacked them at the Cândido Oliveira farm, in the Miranda Military Colony. Caballero fled from the region and lost his sword. Hernâni Donato does not register casualties in this action in either of the two sides. On 8 April, the Paraguayans were in the village of Bela Vista, still resisting, but general Caballero was convinced that Solano López was dead and surrendered, along with 54 soldiers, to major Francisco Xavier Marques. These were the last Paraguayan soldiers to surrender.
Death of Solano López.
Prelude.
The account of Francisco Solano López's death is surrounded by some disagreements and inaccuracies about what, in fact, happened during the events inside the forest, where he fled. Even so, there are common points in the accounts of Paraguayan and Brazilian officers and combatants. After the defeat of his riflemen, López went to the headquarters, in the center of the camp, and from there, together with colonel Silverio Aveiro, major Manuel Cabrera and lieutenant Ignacio Ibarra, all on horseback, they tried to flee, but were overtaken by some Brazilian cavalrymen, on the left, which prevented a flight to the Aquidabán-nigüí stream. In this act, the Brazilian called for Solano López to surrender.
The Brazilian closed in to arrest him. Two soldiers, one on each side, tried to hold him, but López tried to wound one of them with his ceremonial sword, being retaliated with an axe blow to his head, but he was cushioned by the Panama hat he was wearing. One of the imperial calvarymen got off his horse and pierced López with the spear he was holding, from bottom to top, reaching the right groin and reaching the entrails, fatally compromising the peritoneum, intestine, and bladder. This cavalryman was José Francisco Lacerda, known as Chico Diabo (Devil Frank), who was 22 year old and belonged to the regiment of colonel João Nunes da Silva Tavares, of the 19th Provisional Cavalry Corps.
Captain Francisco Argüello and Lieutenant Chamorro arrived to help López, facing the Brazilians with sabers, but due to numerical inferiority and physical conditions, they were defeated, being seriously injured. Despite the victory in this clash, no Brazilian soldier approached López, remaining at a distance of ten meters and waiting for instructions from a superior. Even with the imperial presence, colonel Aveiro managed to get close to López and helped him mount his horse and drove him into the forest, opening the way with his own body, following the footprints and traces left by Paraguayan soldiers that previously went there search of fruits. They soon approached the Aquidabán-nigüí stream, when the Paraguayan president fell from his horse. Aveiro, Cabrera and Ibarra helped him cross the stream, but were unable to make him climb the opposite bank due to his weight. At this point, the three men abandoned López as Correia da Câmara and two imperial soldiers arrived.
General Câmara's report.
Solano López's final moments were witnessed by few if any Paraguayan soldiers and by only a few Brazilian ones, including Brazilian general Correia da Câmara. At the end of the war, Câmara wrote three contradictory reports on the death of López. Câmara wrote the first military report to marshal Vitorino José Carneiro Monteiro, called "parte"", still on 1 March, declaring, twice, that López had been killed in front of him because he did not accept to surrender, despite being "completely defeated and severely wounded".
In a second report, dated 13 March, Câmara suggested that López had died of his wounds, for when he summoned him to surrender, he received a sword blow in response. After that Câmara ordered a soldier to disarm López at the moment "when he exhaled the last torment". In the third, a longer and more detailed report released by the Brazilian government, general Câmara said that he found major José Simeão de Oliveira and the latter informed him that López had "dismounted and gone into the forest", already wounded during the persecution he had faced. Câmara then set off in pursuit of López along with two Brazilian soldiers, finding López on the bank of the Aquidabán-nigüín stream, laying on the opposite bank. In his company there were two Paraguayan officers who were promptly killed for displaying an offensive stance.
Still in this last report, Câmara stated that he called for López to surrender two or three times, at least: "Marshal, hand over your sword. I, the general who commands these forces, guarantee you the rest of your life". The answer would have been: "No me rindo, ni entrego mi espada, muero con ella y por mi patria" (I do not surrender nor deliver my sword, I die with it and for my country), after having struck the air with his sword. Câmara immediately ordered a soldier to disarm him. In this act, López would have been on his stomach, with his face facing the water, and began to struggle. With a lot of effort, he managed to raise his head a little "to exhale his last breath". Therefore, in this report, general Câmara suggested that López had died in the act of being disarmed and arrested, without injury in the forest.
Colonel Silva Tavares' report.
The then general João Nunes da Silva Tavares decided to respond to an article published by Correia da Câmara in the "Gazeta de Porto Alegre" newspaper, on 8 March 1880, about the death of Solano López. He was outraged by Câmara's proposal, that the Paraguayan president would have a gunshot wound in his belly resulting from a natural shootout, while he was trying to cross the stream, omitting the fact that he had been wounded in this part of the body by a spear. According to Silva Tavares, such a report was opposed "to the truth of the facts". He declared that general Câmara received his official report on 2 March 1870, and in it it was reported that López had fled into the forest, already wounded by the spear of his subordinate, corporal Francisco Lacerda.
To prove his statement, Silva Tavares mentioned that he had requested a medical report, with the purpose of certifying the nature of López's injuries, for surgeons Costa Lobo and Barbosa Lisboa. The result of the exam came out only on 25 March, 12 days after Câmara's second report. In this report, the doctors pointed out three wounds: a wound in the frontal region of about seven centimeters, probably caused by a poleaxe. A wound, probably caused by a four-centimeter spear, directed obliquely from bottom to top, fatally irremediable to the marshal's life, compromising the peritoneum, bladder and intestine. And finally, a wound caused by a rifle bullet in the dorsal region, with no way out, since the bullet was lodged in the ribcage.
Câmara omitted this last wound completely. Silva Tavares continued his account: "then the general (Câmara) dismounted, went into the woods, and not far away found López leaning against the bank of the river, with part of his body immersed in the water, with the sword in his hand crossed over his head. the gourd, holding the tip of the sword with the left hand". Silva Tavares proposed that López was ordered to surrender and replied: "I die for my homeland with a sword in my hand". Silva Tavares said that at the moment he was being disarmed, López received a rifle shot, but did not mention who fired it. Such a statement is corroborated by the Viscount of Taunay. According to Taunay, at the moment the marshal was disarmed, a cavalryman came running and fired a shot at close range that would have reached López's heart.
Bounty.
The death of Solano López was, in a sense, desirable by the imperial high command, since Silva Tavares would have offered one hundred pounds to whoever killed López in combat. Emperor Pedro II himself clung to the destitution of the Paraguayan president, not accepting any kind of negotiation. The province of Maranhão had also offered an even higher prize to whoever executed the "tyrant" in combat.
Silva Tavares gave all the credit for the death of Solano López to corporal Francisco Lacerda from his regiment, diverging years later. Lacerda would have received one hundred heifers from his superior in Bagé, going down in history as the man that killed López. The Brazilian soldiery even created a clever ditty in honor of his feat: "O cabo Chico Diabo do Diabo Chico deu cabo" (Corporal Devil Frank has finished off Frank the Devil). However, the author of the shot that actually killed López was João Soares, a cavalryman. Soares also claimed the bounty, but with no officer to defend him, his name was forgotten. Parts of Solano López's body, such as an ear, teeth, and a finger, were torn off by imperial soldiers as trophies.
Aftermath.
Immediately after the battle.
With the end of the battle and the death of Solano López, the war was over. After years of conflict and struggle, Brazilian troops were euphoric and lost self-control. The soldiers began to kill innocent people and set fire to the camp, killing the sick and wounded there. About 240 Paraguayan prisoners were taken, including generals Resquín and Delgado, with probably more than a hundred dead. Among the Brazilians there were only seven wounded. On 2 March, Brazilian troops took the prisoners to the village of Concepción.
On 4 March, news of Solano López's death reached Concepción, where the Count of Eu was. The count could finally return to Rio de Janeiro. A celebratory ball was held, attended by the best families among the town's population, who seemed to be happy with López's death, as well as anti-López Paraguayan officials. In Rio de Janeiro, the news of López's death was received with great joy. Emperor Pedro II recovered his shaky popularity, and on the night of the arrival of the news, he, his wife and princess Isabel walked through the streets of the city, which were full of people, well lit and decorated with flags. Pedro rejected the offer of merchants to erect a statue of himself, advising them to use the resources to build schools. The Count of Eu arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 29 April with a large popular demonstration promoted by the liberals to the detriment of the achievements of Caxias, who was a conservative, presenting Manuel Luís Osório and the Count of Eu as the winners of the war.
Paraguay.
At the end of the war, the country was devastated, in addition to having lost territories disputed with the neighboring countries. The defeat, according to Doratioto, caused "the definitive rupture of a model of economic growth that meant, at the time, the bases for a formidable capitalist expansion throughout the national [productive] system". Even after decades, the country has not been able to maintain a pre-war growth pace compared to its neighbors.
The destruction of the Paraguayan economy was such that the size of its impact was only known when nations such as Argentina and Uruguay were economically consolidated, in addition to the waves of immigration from Europe. Sources differ on human losses, but on average statistics vary from 8.7% to 69% of a population that accounted for between 285,715 and 450,000 inhabitants. This meant that the dead were between 28,286 at the minimum and 278,649 at the maximum. The country was militarily occupied until 13 May 1876 when the last 1,894 Brazilian soldiers were withdrawn.
Allies.
The Empire of Brazil sent about 139,000 soldiers to Paraguay, 1.5% of its population at the time, and more than 50,000 died and about 10,000 became disabled. There was a sense of patriotism among the population, which filled the ranks at the start of the war. In large urban centers, flags and the national anthem had become part of people's daily lives. The emperor's figure was strengthened. The issue of navigability on the Paraguay River was resolved, putting an end to the threat of isolation for the province of Mato Grosso. However, financially, the country suffered years of economic retraction, due to huge expenses of the war, which cost about eleven years of the country's annual public budget; this would explain the constant deficit between the 1870s and 1880s. In addition, there was a consolidation of the army like never before. This institution was responsible, years later, for the coup that would lead to the fall of the monarchy and the establishment of the republic.
Argentina lost between dead and wounded about 18,000 of the 30,000 men it sent to war. During the conflict, the country suffered from internal disputes against the central government, all of which were repressed by Bartolomé Mitre. In the economic field, the country benefited from the sale of meat to Allied troops, with several ranchers, such as Justo José de Urquiza, becoming richer. Uruguay sent 5,583 soldiers to war, losing 3,120. As in Argentina, the war was unpopular in the country, failing to put an end to the internal tension that existed there.
Legacy.
Revisionism.
Over the years after the death of Solano López, the construction of a myth around his figure began, varying according to the time in which it took place. At first, the view of the victors prevailed; in it López was a tyrant, the sole responsible for the war and the destruction of his country, reducing it to a mere tributary of the Empire of Brazil and Argentina. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, thoughts that disagreed with this first interpretation emerged, accusing the Empire of Brazil as the responsible for the war, in the figure of Brazilian republican positivists opposed to the monarchical regime.
In the 1960s, a new interpretation of the Paraguayan leader emerged among left-wing Latin American movements, which exalted López as a great statesman and anti-imperialist military leader. According to such revisionism, López was a leader who fought international imperialism, which had transformed pre-war Paraguay into a progressive country, modernizing it and bringing social welfare to the population, fleeing the capitalist pretensions of the United Kingdom. According to this idea, Argentina and Brazil had been manipulated by the British Empire to annihilate Paraguayan autonomous development.
From the 1980s onwards, new interpretations of the war emerged, contradicting previous revisionism that the British had influenced it. Such an approach points to England trying to avoid it, exemplified by a letter from the British diplomat in Buenos Aires Edward Thornton to the Paraguayan government, offering his services to avoid a conflict between Brazil and Paraguay. It is argued that there is no evidence that the British Empire actively engaged in the Paraguayan defeat. In fact, there was a total lack of knowledge and interest among the British about what happened in that country, as highlighted by British writer and diplomat Richard Francis Burton. According to historian Leslie Bethell, the Paraguayan War was a regional civil war with an international dimension, where responsibility for the conflict lay with all four countries directly involved. This interpretation leads to the argument that local factors, such as internal and external disputes between the nations of the La Plata basin, would have influenced the conflict.
Historical.
Right after the death of Solano López and the end of the Battle of Cerro Corá until the end of the 19th century, there was no question among the Paraguayan survivors that their president had recklessly embarked on a war with neighboring countries. These hated him to the point of developing the idea that the causes of the conflict rested on him. However, as time went by, new views on war, the so-called revisionism, developed.
In the 21st century, Cerro Corá, a name that gives the idea of a surrounded mountainous range, became present in various fields of Paraguayan culture. Several streets, shops and companies in the country bear the name. In addition, Cerro Corá has become a synonym of bravery and martyrdom of the Paraguayan people, represented in the figure of president Solano López. Still in Paraguay, 1 March is "Heroes' Day", with activities throughout the month commemorating the battles of the so-called "Guerra de los 70". In Brazil, Cerro Corá represented the victorious end to a long and hard war, even if it was little propagated. To honor the Brazilian soldiers who fought there, a municipality in Rio Grande do Norte was given the name Cerro Corá in 1953. In 2011, a search on Google Maps for the term Cerro Corá returned ten streets, an avenue and an alley in Brazil.
In 1960, the region of the battle became an army-controlled reserve. On 11 February 1976, under Decree No. 20,698, the Cerro Corá National Park was created. The current region is located within the municipality of Pedro Juan Caballero, capital of the Department of Amambay. There are several monuments in the area that record the development of the battles of the war, in addition to the places where Solano López and his son Panchito died, marked with a bust and a tombstone.
Cultural.
In 1978, a film of the same name about the battle was produced in Paraguay. Cerro Corá, directed by Guillermo Vera, was financed by the Alfredo Stroessner dictatorship and used as propaganda for the ideals proposed by the regime, making it a fundamental piece for the strengthening of historical revisionism in the country. The movied is considered a prominent film within Paraguay. The work depicts the last days of the conflict in 1869, featuring a tired troop made up basically of children and the elderly. Right at the beginning of the movie, the production proposal is declared: "The movie is a message from the Paraguayan government and people in favor of understanding nations in peace and harmony, by demonstrating that wars do not conquer the free determination of peoples, a sublime ideal which led marshal Francisco Solano López to his epic finale". This demonstrates the revisionist character of the production.
The movie features a tired Solano López (played by Roberto De Felice), representing the peak of a devastated country, and Eliza Lynch (Rosa Ros) as firm, despite all the difficulties. Women are shown with great importance in the production, representing the Paraguayan patriarchal figure. Their prominence is presented in two ways: their support in a financial sense or acting on the battlefield. In general, the work directed by Vera seeks to present a country united around an ideal, uniting the different economic classes in favor of independence, in addition to exalting López as a great military leader, who sought at all costs to maintain independence not only for his country, but for all Latin American countries.

<doc id="7034929" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7034929" title="Atiq Ahmed">
Atiq Ahmed

Atiq Ahmed (10 August 1962 – 15 April 2023) was a notorious Indian gangster turned politician and history-sheeter. He served as a member of the Indian Parliament and the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from the Samajwadi Party. Ahmed had more than 160 criminal cases registered against him and competed in several elections from jail. As of March 2023, the Uttar Pradesh Police had seized properties worth belonging to Ahmed and his family. In 2019, he was convicted of kidnapping a witness who testified against him regarding the 2005 murder of his political rival Raju Pal. Ahmed remained in jail until his assassination by three gunmen on his way to a court-mandated medical checkup on 15 April 2023.
Early and personal life.
Atiq Ahmed was born in 1962 to a poor family. His father was a horse-cart driver in Allahabad.
Ahmed was married to Shaista Parveen. The couple had five sons Umar (1998), Ali (2002), Asad (2003–2023), Ahzam (2005) and Abaan (2008). Ahmed's brother Khalid Azim alias Ashraf was also an ex-MLA from the Samajwadi Party.
Political career.
Entry into politics.
Ahmed entered politics in 1989 when he won a MLA seat in Allahabad West as an independent candidate. He retained his seat in the 1991 and 1993 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, and then won the seat in 1996 as a Samajwadi Party (SP) member.

The eleventh judge released him on bail before the elections, but the election was won by Raju Pal's widow, Puja Pal.
In 2014, he was taken back into the Samajwadi Party and fought the national elections for the Shrawasti constituency. He secured a quarter of the votes but lost by more than 85,000 votes to Daddan Mishra of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

On 24 February 2023, Umesh Pal was killed during a shooting and bomb attack. Ahmed was the main suspect accused in this murder case. Ahmed's brother Ashraf, son Asad, and associate Guddu Muslim, a bomb maker who allegedly threw the bomb at Umesh Pal and has been involved in previous violent crimes, were the co-accused.
On 13 April 2023, Ahmed's son, Asad, was killed in an encounter in Jhansi by the Uttar Pradesh Police's Special Task Force (STF).
Ahmed was shifted from the Prayagraj Central Jail to the Sabarmati Jail in Prayagraj in June 2019.
Within two months of Pal's murder, six accused, including Ahmed, his brother and son were killed.
Death.
On 15 April 2023, while being escorted for a court-mandated medical checkup in the presence of police in Prayagraj, Ahmed was asked about his absence during his son's last rites, to which he replied, "They didn't take me, so I didn't go." Before Ahmed's brother Ashraf could complete his statement, "The main thing is that Guddu Muslim...", a pistol was fired at Atiq Ahmed's head at point-blank range, and he died on the spot. Ashraf Ahmed was also killed in the attack, which was captured and broadcast live on television. The brothers were surrounded by police personnel at the time of the shooting. 
The three perpetrators had posed as media personnel. They were surrounded by police personnel, following which they made a last attempt to escape, while chanting the slogan "Jai Shri Ram". They were identified and arrested. Reporting on the first information report from Uttar Pradesh Police, "Times of India" reported that "the accused told police they wanted to make a name for themselves and establish their identity in the state by eliminating Ahmed's gang." A Supreme Court bench noted that despite the presence of 5-10 people guarding Ahmed and his brother, they were shot dead, and commented that "someone is complicit".

Paul Wilson (musician)

Paul "Pablo" Wilson (born 20 October 1978) is a Scottish musician, who is best known as the former bass guitarist for Northern Irish–Scottish alternative rock band Snow Patrol. He previously played guitar in Glasgow band Terra Diablo during 2000–2005. Wilson plays left-handed and generally uses a black Rickenbacker for concerts. He is a multi-instrumentalist trained in piano.
Musical career.
Wilson, was born and grew up in Kinlochleven and attended the Kinlochleven High School. He always wanted to be a musician and has said that it is the only thing "he's ever done". He has said that if he couldn't be a musician, he would have worked as a music producer or teach children how to be in a band. Wilson is a multi-instrumentalist, and can play instruments such as piano, guitar, bass, drums and banjo. He went to music school to learn the piano, and in his own words, can "play most things unless they have to be blown into". He has been friends with members of Snow Patrol since 1995, during their "wilderness years".
In 2000, he joined Glasgow band Terra Diablo as guitarist. Whenever Terra Diablo supported Snow Patrol on tours, Wilson joined Snow Patrol on-stage as an unofficial member, contributing guitar and keyboards. He once joked that he agreed to tour with Snow Patrol only the condition that Terra Diablo could tour with them. Wilson left Terra Diablo in mid-February 2005, the reasons for which were not made public. On 16 March 2005, Snow Patrol bassist Mark McClelland was fired from the band. Vocalist Gary Lightbody asked Wilson to replace him. He accepted, and switched to the bass guitar when he joined the band. He played his first show as permanent member in Dingle on 1 April 2005. In October 2006, during the Eyes Open Tour, he injured his left arm and shoulder. Though wanting to continue, the band thought better and six concerts were subsequently cancelled.
Wilson also guested on Film School's 2007 album "Hideout".
Wilson left Snow Patrol in September 2023 to focus on his metal project named "Above as Below", releasing the song "Luna".
Musical style.
His favourite instrument is the guitar, which he played for nineteen years, before switching to bass. He found the transition difficult, as he felt that one could "get away with more" playing the guitar. He finds the bass a difficult and challenging instrument to play and "express" oneself. But he enjoys playing it and likes the potential of the instrument: "By changing one note, you can make the whole thing sound a lot better". Apart from writing bass-lines for the band, Wilson occasionally contributes guitar and piano parts, and also plays keyboards live on "Just Say Yes". He writes bass-lines based on the song's rhythm and at times teams up with drummer Jonny Quinn to come up with a basic riff or simple chord changes. He plays the bass left-handed, and prefers using a pick. On-stage, he generally uses a black Rickenbacker 4000 bass.
Personal life.
As a child, Wilson was a huge fan of Star Wars, and owned toys of all characters. He has the name of his previous band "Terra Diablo" tattooed on the inside of his left arm.

Turks and Caicos Islands national cricket team

The Turks and Caicos Islands cricket team is the team that represents the British overseas territory of the Turks and Caicos Islands in international cricket.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between the Turks and Caicos Islands and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the T20I status.
History.
Cricket is the national sport of the Turks and Caicos Islands. They became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2002 and an associate member in 2017. Their international debut following their membership came in the Americas Affiliates Championship in 2004 when they played the Bahamas. They finished the tournament in fourth place, with their only win coming against Suriname. They played in Division Three of the ICC Americas Championship in 2006, finishing as runners up to Suriname, just missing out on promotion to Division Two. They were invited to take part in the 2008 Standford 20/20, playing one match in a preliminary round against Montserrat. The match, which held official Twenty20 status, resulted in a Montserrat victory by 9 wickets, resulting in their elimination from the tournament. Donovan Matthews top-scored for the team with 25, while no other batsman reached double figures. Henry Saunders took the only wicket to fall in Montserrat's innings. Shortly after, they took part in the 2008 ICC Americas Championship Division Three, which they won to gain promotion to Division Two. In 2010, they took part in the ICC Americas Championship Division Two, finishing fourth but retaining their status in Division Two. The team finally made an official international debut in 2025 playing in the Men's Central American Championships where they also went on to win their first T20 International.

Frazer Smith

Frazer Smith, also known as Frazier Smith (born January 17, 1955), nicknamed "The Fraze", is an American radio personality, actor and stand-up comedian.
Smith was born in Detroit, Michigan.
Career.
Smith worked in Los Angeles at KROQ-FM from 1976 through 1979, KLOS from 1979 through 1984, KMET 1984 through 1986, KLSX 1986 through 1997, KLOS in 1997, and KRTH in 2002. He has played small roles in films and television shows and was one of the announcers on the TBS music video show "Night Tracks" from 1986 to 1988 and 1989 to 1991.
The debut of his manic show on KROQ-FM coincided with that station's rise playing what was then-new new wave music. His extended improvisational comedy based on a mythical lothario/detective was also heard on the sporadically-produced "Hollywood Nightshift", which featured Phil Austin of The Firesign Theatre, as well as movie, TV actor and radio DJ, Michael C. Gwynne, who also ran the board and spun the records. There was never a script, contrary to popular reviews of the time. A 'topic' appeared spontaneously as the theme ran and announcer Laura Quinn got set to introduce 'the boys.'
For several years Smith, along with Peter "Crabman" Crabbe, made an annual tradition of offering an alternate audio commentary to television coverage of the famous Tournament of Roses Parade. Listeners would be told to tune in to Los Angeles television station KTLA, which was hosted by Stephanie Edwards and Bob Eubanks. Smith would tell viewers to turn down the television volume and turn up the radio to hear the comedy parody, which included discussing news themes from the past year and applying them to the floats. For example, the year of the O. J. Simpson slow-speed car chase, one of the floats was described as a reenactment of the event. Smith and Crabbe would also describe the passing bands while playing continuous looped marching band music.
Smith is noted for his KROQ-FM simulcasts of the 1978 World Series. He coined the phrase "Too hip, gotta go!" while at KLOS.
Smith also hosted the late night television show called "Rock 'N' America", in 1984.

William Hays (general)

William Hays (May 9, 1819 – February 7, 1875) was a career officer in the United States Army, serving as a Union Army general during the American Civil War.
Early life.
Hays was born in Richmond, Virginia, but moved to Nashville, Tennessee. Andrew Jackson appointed Hays to the United States Military Academy, where he graduated in 1840 alongside William T. Sherman, George H. Thomas, and Richard S. Ewell. He was initially a brevet second lieutenant, and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1847, serving at various posts in the northeastern states.
He served throughout the Mexican–American War with the light artillery, alongside future Civil War artilleryman Henry J. Hunt. He was wounded at the Battle of Molino del Rey, and was subsequently appointed a brevet captain for Contreras and Churubusco and major for Chapultepec. From 1853 (when he was promoted to captain) until 1854, he was engaged in the Seminole Wars in Florida, and was on routine frontier duty in 1856–60 in the 3rd and then the 5th U.S. Artillery.
Civil War.
As a lieutenant colonel, Hays commanded a brigade of horse artillery under Henry Hunt in 1861–62 in the Army of the Potomac, serving with distinction at the Battle of Seven Pines during the Peninsula Campaign. He participated in the Battle of Antietam, where he commanded the V Corps Reserve Artillery. His batteries were stationed on the heights east of Antietam Creek, providing long range fire against Confederate infantry positions between the East and West Woods. He commanded the artillery of the Right Grand Division at Fredericksburg. Hays was appointed brigadier general of volunteers in November 1862 and assigned command of an infantry brigade in Maj. Gen. William H. French's division in the II Corps. He was wounded and taken prisoner at Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863, along with all but one of his immediate staff.
Hays was exchanged on May 15, 1863, and sent to Fort Monroe in Virginia. Although without an official command, he rejoined the Army of the Potomac and accompanied it to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. During Pickett's Charge on July 3, Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock was severely wounded but refused to leave the field until the battle had been decided. When it became clear the Confederate charge had been defeated Hancock relinquished command temporarily to his 1st Division commander, Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell. Later that evening, Hays (although still a brigadier general and junior in rank to Caldwell), was assigned to command the II Corps. He led the corps throughout the summer until permanent command was given to Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren in mid-September. In November, Hays was appointed provost marshal of the southern district of New York, and was also promoted to major in the regular army.
At the expiration of his term in February 1865, Hays rejoined the Army of the Potomac at Petersburg and served again in the II Corps, this time commanding the 2nd Division. He was appointed a brevet brigadier general in the regular army on March 13, 1865, for gallant conduct, but on April 6 he was relieved of command for sleeping on duty and thus failing to prepare his troops for departure as they pursued Confederate forces. His brevets were revoked and Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow was assigned to lead the division. From that date, Hays commanded the Artillery Reserve of the Army of the Potomac until he was mustered out of volunteer service in January 1866.
Later life.
Reverting to his permanent rank of major of the 5th U.S. Artillery, Hays served on various posts, commanding Fort Independence in Boston Harbor from April 1873 until his death there almost two years later. He was buried in Yonkers, New York, but was re-interred at West Point Cemetery in 1894.

In 1994, Bermeister and his property consortium Jacfun negotiated rights to property at Sydney's Darling Harbour and established the interactive Sega World Sydney amusement park, operated through a joint venture including shareholders Sega Enterprises Japan, Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsui Corp.
Bermeister founded Brilliant Digital Entertainment Inc. in 1996, focusing on 3D graphics streaming and compression for which it was granted 8 patents. BDE was the founding member of the Distributed Industry Computing Association. The company developed a number of Internet interests including Altnet, a joint venture with Joltid Ltd., to develop and market secure distributed storage for content using P2P technology to reduce distribution costs and reach new audiences. In 2003 Altnet, using its distributed storage technology, became the largest provider of secure DRM content, having distributed 75 million licensed files to users of various P2P file sharing software applications. Another initiative undertaken by Altnet under Bermeister's stewardship is Global File Registry, which enables governments and copyright owners to police the distribution of illegal or infringing material over distributed systems and the Internet.
In 2006 BDE, Altnet and Kazaa settled major litigation with leading music and motion picture industry plaintiffs. Since then, Bermeister has focused on building and acquiring content, technology and distribution assets for BDE.
During 2006, BDE was acquired by Kinetech Inc., a company with interests in patents and intellectual property licensing relating primarily to certain key distributed technologies that had been licensed by Altnet since 2002 and important to P2P storage and Global File Registry businesses of Altnet. Kinetech's patent and technology portfolio is often referred to as the True Name Patent Portfolio.
In 2008, BDE acquired the Kazaa Trademark and relaunched Kazaa with music licenses from major music labels Universal, Sony, Warner Music Group and EMI, major independent record labels, and leading music publishers.
In 2011, BDE subsidiary Kinetech acquired a majority interest in PersonalWeb LLC PersonalWeb, a Tyler, Texas-based technology company. PersonalWeb develops its software based in part on the 13 pending and issued patents in the Truenames Patent Portfolio.
Activity in Israel.
Bermeister is an active investor in Israeli real estate. In his latest real estate endeavours, he teamed with an Israeli retail magnate to bid for Nof Zion, a major residential project in East Jerusalem and he acquired a stake in The Leonardo Inn at the entrance to the city. He is a founder of Jerusalem 5800, a long-term planning and research project for greater Jerusalem.
Charity and sponsorship.
Bermeister is a major benefactor and supporter of numerous charitable organisations including The Hunger Project, United Israel Appeal, Jewish Care, UniOne Foundation and Jake's Ladder, a foundation for research into cystic fibrosis, The City of David and Binyan Adei Ad. He was recently awarded the Yeshiva Center Leadership in Philanthropy Award.

Virginia State Route 54

State Route 54 (SR 54) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. Known for most of its length as Patrick Henry Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 33 (US 33) in Montpelier east to US 301/SR 2 in Hanover Courthouse. SR 54 is the main east–west highway of Hanover County, connecting the western part of the county and the county seat with the central town of Ashland, where the highway meets US 1 and Interstate 95 (I-95).
Route description.
SR 54 begins at an intersection with US 33 (Mountain Road) just east of Montpelier. The state highway heads east as two-lane Patrick Henry Road, which intersects Scotchtown Road. Scotchtown Road heads north toward Scotchtown, the estate of Patrick Henry. SR 54 heads southeast and crosses the South Anna River and Kings Pond, an impoundment of Falling Creek, before entering the town of Ashland, where the highway becomes Thompson Street. The state highway intersects CSX's RF&amp;P Subdivision just south of the Ashland Amtrak station. SR 54 continues east as England Street, a three-lane road with center turn lane, and passes to the south of the campus of Randolph-Macon College. The state highway expands to a six-lane divided highway at US 1 (Washington Highway) and passes through a commercial area between the U.S. Highway and the state highway's partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95. East of the Interstate, SR 54 reduces to two lanes and leaves the town of Ashland, becoming Patrick Henry Road again. The state highway intersects CSX's Piedmont Subdivision before reaching its eastern terminus at US 301/SR 2 (Hanover Courthouse Highway) within the Hanover County Courthouse Historic District.

Cumulative distribution function.
The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the half-logistic distribution is intimately related to the cdf of the logistic distribution. Formally, if "F"("k") is the cdf for the logistic distribution, then "G"("k") = 2"F"("k") − 1 is the cdf of a half-logistic distribution. Specifically,

Connecticut Route 142

Route 142 is a state highway in Connecticut that serves as an alternate route of US 1, passing through the village of Short Beach on the Branford shoreline. It starts at US 1 in East Haven and ends at US 1 in Branford, running for .
Route description.
Route 142 begins as Hemingway Avenue at an intersection with US 1 in East Haven. It heads south, intersecting with Route 100 (Main Street) in the downtown area, and then turns eastward about later along Short Beach Road. This intersection also marks the western end of Route 337, which continues straight. Route 142 goes through the southern part of East Haven as it heads towards the village of Short Beach. After crossing the Farm River into the town of Branford, the road becomes known as Shore Drive. In Branford, it continues east through Short Beach and Double Beach, then turns north along Short Beach Road to end at another intersection with US 1 in the Branford Hills neighborhood.
The section of Route 142 in Branford from Double Beach Road to the eastern terminus is designated the "William E. Keish, Jr. Memorial Highway", named after a Connecticut Department of Transportation official.
History.
In 1922, Connecticut first numbered its state highways. The route through Short Beach was, at that time, designated as State Highway 171. Modern Route 142 was created in the 1932 state highway renumbering from old Highway 171. In 1962, the portion north of the intersection with Route 337 was transferred to Route 100, and Route 142 was extended westward along Silver Sands Road and modern Route 337 to US 1 in the Annex section of New Haven. In 1969, these changes were reversed. The former section in New Haven was designated SR 704, which later became Route 337 in 1987.

Vanuatu national cricket team

The Vanuatu national cricket team is the men's team that represents Vanuatu in international cricket. The team is organised by the Vanuatu Cricket Association, which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1995 and an associate member in 2009. Vanuatu made its international debut at the 1979 Pacific Games, at which time the country was still known as the New Hebrides. The majority of the team's matches have come against other members of the ICC East Asia-Pacific region, including both at ICC regional tournaments and at the cricket events at the Pacific Games.
Vanuatu entered the World Cricket League at the 2008 Division Five tournament. The team participated in the WCL system at the 2015 Division Six event, where it placed third. Following the withdrawal of Suriname from the 2016 Division Five tournament, Vanuatu were named as their replacement. After the abolition of the WCL, Vanuatu currently is part of the 2019–22 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League.
History.
Vanuatu competed in the Pacifica Championships on the two occasions it was held, finishing seventh in 2001 and sixth in 2002. In 2005, they hosted the East Asia/Pacific Cricket Cup, finishing third in the six team competition, therefore missing out on qualification for the 2007 World Cup.
At the East Asia – Pacific Trophy in Auckland, New Zealand, in December 2007, Vanuatu finished second, therefore qualifying through to the World Cricket League Division Five in 2008. In the highly successful 2009 calendar year, Vanuatu defeated Fiji in two One-Day Series in Port Vila as well as claiming the prestigious 2009 ICC EAP Men's Cricket Trophy (Non-World Cricket League) held in Samoa, defeating the hosts in the final.
At a junior level, Vanuatu has finished second to Papua New Guinea in the following competitions:
East Asia – Pacific Under 15 Super 8s, Melbourne, Australia, 2005;
East Asia – Pacific Under 15 Super 8s, Apia, Samoa, 2007;
East Asia – Pacific Under 19 World Cup Qualifying Tournament, Port Vila, Vanuatu, 2007.
Vanuatu finished third in the 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Eight in Kuwait. This means they stayed in that league for the 2012 competition.
2018–present.
At the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Four tournament, Vanuatu recorded victories against Bermuda, a former ODI team, and Denmark, which has previously played as high as Division Two. However, they were still relegated to Division Five based on net run rate.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Vanuatu and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.
Vanuatu made its Twenty20 International debut on 22 March 2019, losing to Papua New Guinea by 8 wickets in the 2018–19 ICC T20 World Cup East Asia-Pacific Qualifier at Amini Park, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea
After April 2019, Vanuatu played in the 2019–21 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League.
In August 2019, Australian Clint McKay was appointed as the interim coach of the team, ahead of the 2019 Malaysia Cricket World Cup Challenge League A tournament.
