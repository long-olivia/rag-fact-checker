Gorduno

Gorduno is a former municipality in the district of Bellinzona in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

History.
The area around Gorduno was prehistorically settled, though very little is known about the earlier settlements. The modern municipality of Gorduno is first mentioned in 1182 as "medius locus de Gorduno". It was first mentioned in the dispute between the churches of Como and Milan, which was settled by the verdict of 1202. In the verdict Como received the little church of SS Maurizio e Carpoforo in the so-called Castle of Gnosca, which, contrary to the name, was in the territory of Gorduno. The church was strategically located on the Ticino river. In the Late Middle Ages, Gorduno was a municipality in the County of Bellinzona. In 1374, the municipality was combined with Gnosca and placed under the control of Podestà, a canon of Milan. This placed the church under the Ambrosian Rite of the Diocese of Milan. The village had completely split from the community celebrating according to the Roman Rite in Bellinzona by 1538-83. The parish functions moved from the Castle Church to the village church of SS Sebastiano e Rocco.

Rashtrapati Award

Rashtrapati Awards used to be given by the President of India, in some cases the Prime Minister of India, for achievements in the field of sports, art, military, literature, cinema, culture, science and technology, or Scouting. The award-giving ceremony was conducted in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the President's official residence. The awards were a part of the Indian honours system. However, after gradual systematic categorizations over a period, the awards were made independent to the field of achievement.
For example, from 1968 onwards, the Directorate of Film Festivals completely took over its charge as the governing body for National Film Awards India. Before 1968, the award in the field of best acting in Indian Cinema was given out as a Rashtrapati Award. Other examples are Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna for sports, National Bravery Award, Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, Jnanpith Award for literature, "Maharishi Badrayan Vyas Samman" (a presidential honour for young scholars below age 40 who have worked to bridge the ancient and the modern especially using IT).

Fire of Moscow (1571)

The Fire of Moscow occurred on 24 May 1571, when the Crimean and Ottoman army ( 40,000 Tatar horsemen, 13,000 irregular Turks and 7,000 janissaries) led by the khan of Crimea Devlet I Giray, bypassed the Serpukhov defensive fortifications on the Oka River, crossed the Ugra River into the Moscow suburbs, and rounded the flank of the 36,000–40,000 men of the Russian army.
Prelude.
The sentry troops of Russians were crushed by the Crimean and Ottoman forces. Not having forces to stop the invasion, the Russian army retreated to Moscow. The rural Russian population also fled to the capital. After defeating the Russian army, the Crimean forces besieged the town of Moscow, because in 1556 and 1558, Muscovy, violating the oath given to the Giray dynasty, attacked the lands of the Crimean Khanate — Muscovite troops invaded Crimea and burned villages and towns in Western and Eastern Crimea, with many Crimean Tatars captured or killed. In 1561, Muscovites "received a letter from the Patriarch of Constantinople" (which turned out to be false), asserting the rights of Ivan the Terrible to claim himself the Tsar. By 1563, relations between the Muscovy and the Crimean Khanate finally deteriorated.
By 23 May 1571, Tatar troops approached Moscow, setting up a camp near Kolomenskoye. At the same time, Russian voivodes entered the city. The army of Ivan Belsky stood on Bolshaya Street, and the regiment of Ivan Mstislavsky and Ivan Sheremetev on Yakimanka. The advanced regiment of Mikhail Vorotynsky and Pyotr Tatev stood on the Tagansky meadow, while the army of Vasily Tiomkin-Rostovsky was behind Neglinnaya. According to chroniclers, "Prince Ivan Dmitrievich Belskoy went against the Crimean people across the Moskva River to the meadow behind the Swamp and did business with them." During the battle, the Crimeans pushed back the Russians, Prince Belsky was wounded, and a fire rapidly spread through the city.
Fire.
The Crimean Tatar forces set the suburbs on fire on 24 May and a sudden wind blew the flames into Moscow and the city went up in a conflagration. According to Heinrich von Staden, a German in the service of Ivan the Terrible (he claimed to be a member of the Oprichnina)," the city, the palace, the Oprichnina palace, and the suburbs burned down completely in six hours. It was a great disaster because no one could escape." People fled into stone churches to escape the flames, but the stone churches collapsed (either from the intensity of the fire or the pressure of the crowds.) People also jumped into the Moscow River to escape, where many drowned. The powder magazine of the Kremlin exploded and those hiding in the cellar there asphyxiated. The tsar ordered the dead found on the streets to be thrown into the river, which overflowed its banks and flooded parts of the town. Jerome Horsey wrote that it took more than a year to clear away all the bodies.
Aftermath.
The march on Moscow, which was carried out by the Tatars, is considered to be the final major devastation inflicted upon the city. It was the most destructive Crimean Tatar invasion of Russia since the invasion of 1521. Scholars argue that the fire in 1571 was even more widespread than the great fire of Moscow in 1547. The aftermath of the raid was so catastrophic that it was said that there were no remaining poles in the city to tie a horse to. Determining the exact number of casualties and captives during the Devlet Giray campaign is challenging. Different sources provide varying estimates, ranging from 60 to 150 thousand individuals enslaved and from 10 to 120 thousand people killed in the attack on Moscow. The Crimean ambassador in Warsaw claimed that 60 thousand individuals lost their lives during the campaign, while an equal number were captured. On the other hand, Giles Fletcher believed that the death toll reached a staggering 800 thousand people. Although this figure is clearly exaggerated, it cannot be denied that Russia suffered immense losses. The extensive destruction of Moscow is further confirmed by the papal legate Antonio Possevino who reported a population of no more than 30 thousand individuals in 1580. This is in stark contrast to the 41,500 houses and at least 100 thousand inhabitants that Moscow had in 1520.
The battle of Moscow had a significant impact on the Russian military, leading to substantial losses. However, despite these setbacks, the Russian troops did not face defeat. The unfolding events during the battle caused great distress within the army, with their wagons being nearly completely destroyed by fire on the streets of Moscow. Additionally, numerous horses were lost, and the field artillery suffered damage. Despite these challenges, the number of troops recruited from local cavalry, which relied on the support of serving cities, did not experience a significant decrease, as evident from the campaign of 1572.
The fire had a significant influence on both the domestic and foreign policy decisions made by Ivan the Terrible. The inability of the Oprichniks to protect the capital highlighted the urgent necessity of disbanding the Oprichnina. Furthermore, the Oprichny Palace, which had been reduced to ashes, was not reconstructed, and a number of influential oprichniks paid the ultimate price through execution. Following the devastating incidents, the authorities in Moscow contemplated the construction of a formidable stone barrier encompassing Bely Gorod, strategically designed to render it impervious to the relentless onslaught of the Tatar cavalry. In this regard, during the early 1590s, the government of Boris Godunov, who was the brother-in-law of the Tsar, took the initiative to construct a structure known as the Belgorod Wall.
The campaign launched against Moscow had a significant impact on the foreign policy dynamics of the Russian state, resulting in a notable transformation in its international relations. Ivan the Terrible faced a multitude of challenges in addition to his difficult relationships with the Crimean Khanate and the Ottoman Empire. He was also forced to make compromises and concessions when engaging in negotiations with various other states. In the year 1571, he consented to the extension of trade privileges specifically for merchants from England.

Moelona

Moelona was the pen-name of Elizabeth (Lizzie) Mary Jones (née Owen) (21 June 1877 – 5 June 1953), a Welsh novelist and translator who wrote novels for children and other works in Welsh.
Early life.
She was born at Rhydlewis, Ceredigion, the youngest of thirteen children, on a farm called "Moylon", hence her choice of pseudonym. Her parents were John Owen and Mary James Owen. She went to school at Rhydlewis, one of her schoolmates being Caradoc Evans. In 1890 she became a pupil-teacher, the need to care for her widowed father preventing her from obtaining any tertiary education.
Career.
Fiction.
Moelona taught school as a young woman, at Pontrhydyfen, Bridgend, and Acrefair. She moved to Cardiff in 1905. She wrote her first novel ("Rhamant o Ben y Rhos)" for an eisteddfod in 1907, but it was not published until 1918 (as "Rhamant y Rhos)". In 1911 she published two romance novellas, "Rhamant Nyrs Bivan" (Nurse Bevan's Romance) and "Alys Morgan." She won a prize at the National Eisteddfod for another work of fiction, a didactic novella titled "Teulu Bach Nantoer" (The Little Family of Nantoer) in 1912; after it was published the next year, it became a popular Welsh-language children's book for many years.
In her novel "Bugail y Bryn" (1917) she evokes the Welsh dialect of south Cardiganshire, with an explanatory note (before page 1) of the most common distinctive features. "Cwrs y lli" (The Course of the Stream, 1927), a desert-island adventure "Breuddwydion Myfanwy" (The Dreams of Myfanwy, 1928) and "Beryl" (1931) were considered "girls' novels". Her last novel was "Ffynnonloyw" (Bright Spring, 1939), in which the characters exemplify the progress Welsh women experienced in the early twentieth century.
Translation, lectures, journalism.
Moelona joined a British-French Society in Cardiff, and became acquainted with the works of Alphonse Daudet, several of which she translated for Welsh-language periodicals, and published as "Y wers olaf" (The Last Lesson, 1921). Her husband was also a writer, and encouraged her in her writing career by making her the children's columnist on "Y Darian", a periodical which he edited. She also wrote a women's column for the paper beginning in 1919; she encouraged women to read more about current events, to prepare for the vote. She gave a lecture on "The Novel" at the second meeting of the Celtic Society at Aberystwyth in 1923. She also wrote two textbooks in Welsh, "Priffordd Llên" (1924) and "Storïau o Hanes Cymru" (1930).
Personal life.
In 1917, Lizzie Owen married a widowed Baptist minister and editor, John Tywi Jones, in Cardiff. His daughters Sophie and Gwyneth lived with them in Glais, Swansea. The couple lived in New Quay, Ceredigion, from 1935 until their respective deaths in 1949 and 1953. Her grave is in Rhydlewis. A collection of her letters, scrapbooks, and manuscripts are archived in the National Library of Wales.

Diminished octave

In music from Western culture, a diminished octave () is an interval produced by narrowing a perfect octave by a chromatic semitone. As such, the two notes are denoted by the same letter but have different accidentals. For instance, the interval from C4 to C5 is a perfect octave, twelve semitones wide, and both the intervals from C4 to C5 and from C4 to C5 are diminished octaves, spanning eleven semitones. Being diminished, it is considered a dissonant interval.
The diminished octave is enharmonically equivalent to the major seventh.

History.
Prehistory.
In 1909–10, work on the banks of the Ticino river in the hamlet of Progero uncovered an extensive prehistoric burial ground. This site, known as "A Progero" is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. The oldest finds are pottery fragments, indicating that the area was probably inhabited in the Early Bronze Age (17th–16th century BC). The next layer of finds included grave pottery from the Late Bronze Age (13th–12th century BC). Most of the necropolis (over 300 graves) dates from the Iron Age (6th century BC). This settlement is from the Golasecca culture and lasted until about the 2nd century BC. The graves from this period are almost exclusively full-body burials. The graves are surrounded by stone walls and covered with boards or stones arranged around the top. In some cases the stele stones with inscriptions have been found close to the graves.
Many of the late Bronze Age grave goods come in the form of bi-conical, lens-like urns. Typical of the Golasecca era, most graves have one or more ceramic vessels (urns, bowls, mugs and more rarely jugs) along with ornaments made of bronze (brooches, earrings, pendant, belt buckles) and amber (necklaces, earrings and beads). Some of the bronze vessels are situlas (bucket-like containers), but the other typical vessels of the Golasecca culture (such as beak jugs) have not been found. Particularly noteworthy is a bucket (from the turn of the 6th to the 5th century BC) carved with characters in the Lugano or Lepontic.
The cemetery continued to be used after the Golasecca era. Items have been found from the Latène era. When the Celtic groups came across the Alps to the South Alpine region and penetrated the Po Valley, they settled around Gudo and used the cemetery. Grave goods from these eras include ceramic tableware, La Tène type brooches, beads of glass paste and amber, bronze or silver rings and pendants.
Medieval Gudo.
The modern village of Gudo is first mentioned in 1277 as "Gudio". In 1264, the Knights Hospitaller of Contone, the council of Como, the cathedrals of Bellinzona and Locarno, and the Locarno noble families of Muralto and Magoria all owned land in Gudo. Gudo documented its citizens' rights in 1363, and Progero is mentioned as a separate community. In Progero the Church of Santa Maria, was rebuilt in the 17th century. Here, according to legend, existed a Benedictine monastery. Gudo and Sementina separated from the mother church in Bellinzona in 1440. Excavations around the parish church of S. Lorenzo in 1992, found a predecessor church from the 6th–7th centuries. This church is the oldest church building that has been archaeologically examined in the Bellinzona area. The present church dates back to 1615 and was restored between 1990 and 2000.
Modern Gudo.
In 1888, the Ticino river natural course was modified, leading to a rise in population. In 1907, an iron bridge was built, which allowed a road to connect the Magadino Plain with Cadenazzo. In 1932–36, the Canton built a farm ("Demanio agricolo") in Gudo.
The economy of the municipality is based on agriculture in the Lake Maggiore area. Vineyards grow on the slopes of the town, so at the beginning of the 20th century Gudo was the most important center of Ticino's wine industry. On the right bank of the Ticino River, the microclimate of the Gudese lands is ideal for producing wines of the highest quality. Even today, its vineyards are among the largest in the canton. Dry white Merlot is unique to Ticino, and it is one of the peculiarities of Gudo.
Gudo is primarily a residential community, and in 2000, most residents worked outside the community. The kindergarten and primary school are housed in the municipal government building, there are two hotels, restaurants and a public park with a new playground. Cycling is a popular outdoor activity in Ticino, so there is an e-bike charging point next to Albergo Garni Anita. Gudo, Serta is a bus stop close to the Nucleo - the old centre of Gudo.

WCTC

WCTC (1450 AM "Fox Sports New Jersey") is a commercial radio station broadcasting a sports radio format. Licensed to New Brunswick, New Jersey, the station serves Middlesex, Somerset, and Union counties. The station is owned by Beasley Broadcast Group (through Beasley Media Group, LLC). It is the radio home for Rutgers University athletic events and Somerset Patriots Minor League Baseball games. It is the radio affiliate for New York Knicks basketball and New York Rangers hockey.
WCTC transmits with 1,000 watts, non-directional. It formerly broadcast in C-QUAM AM stereo. The transmitter is off Valentine Street at South 5th Avenue in Highland Park, New Jersey, near the Raritan River. Programming is also heard on 250-watt FM translator W228DY at 93.5 MHz in New Brunswick.
History.
WCTC is considered New Jersey's first radio station built during the post-World War II broadcast boom. It signed on in 1946. The following year, it added an FM station, 98.3 WCTC-FM (today WMGQ). WCTC derives its call sign from the Chanticleer, a flamboyant fighting rooster from the medieval fable Reynard the Fox ("Le Roman de Renart"). It is also used by Geoffrey Chaucer in the "Canterbury Tales" which was the Rutgers mascot from 1925 to 1955.
From the 1960s through the 1980s, WCTC adopted a full service middle of the road (MOR) format featuring local news, talk, sports, and adult popular music. For most of those years, Jack Ellery was the popular wake-up host.
In 1992, WCTC gave up music programming, switching to talk radio, featuring programming from ABC Radio and Premiere Radio Networks. As of July 2, 2008, WCTC went back to its roots by reverting to an oldies music format.
On February 28, 2011, WCTC changed the format back to talk, launching the local midday show "New Jersey TODAY" hosted by Bert Baron.
On July 19, 2016, Beasley Media Group announced it would acquire Greater Media and its 21 stations (including WCTC) for $240 million. The FCC approved the sale on October 6, and the sale closed on November 1.
Under Beasley ownership, WCTC was the primary source for winter school closing announcements. In later years, WCTC's talk programming included "This Morning, America's First News with Gordon Deal", "Markley, Van Camp &amp; Robbins", Guy Benson, and local host Tommy G. in afternoon drive time. WCTC carried hourly news from NBC News Radio. WCTC also aired special interest shows on the weekends.
In July 2021, WCTC began simulcasting on an FM translator, 93.5 W228DY. On September 26, 2021, the station dropped news/talk for sports as "Fox Sports New Jersey", primarily featuring Fox Sports Radio programming.

Lumino

Lumino is a municipality in the district of Bellinzona in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
Lumino is first mentioned in 1168 as "locus Lugomini". In German it used to be known as "Lugmin". The convenient location at the entrance to the "Val Mesolcina" and the ancient fortifications in the neighborhood indicate that there was an early settlement. The assets of the Bishop of Como in Lumino were given to Capitanei of Locarno in the 12th century. It is listed as part of the County of Bellinzona in 1335. By 1242 it was already part of a community with Castione, which was dissolved in 1818. Several properties and the tithe belonged to the parish church of Bellinzona. The Church of St. Mamette was first mentioned in 1237 and became a parish church before 1591. The border between Lumino and the Graubünden village of San Vittore was finalized, after centuries of dispute, in 1776. During construction of the new roadway over the San Bernardino Pass in 1818, the cantonal authorities forbade the inhabitants of Lumino from making improvements on the road between the Moesa bridge and the border with Graubünden.

The Martian Chronicles (miniseries)

The Martian Chronicles is a 1980 television three-episode miniseries based on Ray Bradbury's 1950 book "The Martian Chronicles" and dealing with the exploration of Mars and the inhabitants there. The series starred Rock Hudson, Darren McGavin, Bernadette Peters, Roddy McDowall, Fritz Weaver, Barry Morse, and Maria Schell. It was aired on NBC in January 1980 in three episodes with a total running time of just over four hours (nearly five hours on the DVD version). The series depicts Mars as having a "thin atmosphere" which humans can breathe, with water-filled canals and desert-like vegetation. The miniseries was directed by Michael Anderson and written by Richard Matheson.
Episodes.
The Expeditions.
"Episode 1, 27 January 1980"
The first episode starts at the scene of "Viking 1" uncrewed probe landing on the surface of the planet Mars in July 1976. A narrator explains that the purpose of the probe is to determine whether Mars is inhabited. As the narrator is speaking, the viewer becomes aware that there are two viewpoints at NASA amongst the scientists who launched the probe: One group obviously believes Mars is uninhabited, the other is open to the possibility of indigenous life on the planet. Each has its convincing arguments, but ultimately the probe indicates that Mars does not harbor life. At the close of the scene the camera pans back to show a larger view of the probe's landing area, with what appears to be indigenous Martian settlements in the surrounding terrain, with the narrator noting that, "If the probe had landed just a few miles further on, things might have been different." Afterwards the opening credits roll.
The next scene places the viewer at the Kennedy Space Center in January 1999 when the first "Zeus I" crewed spacecraft to Mars is carried into orbit by a Saturn V rocket. The Zeus project represents the beginning of a major effort by NASA and NATO to explore and eventually colonize the outer planets.
On Mars, Ylla (a Martian woman trapped in a loveless marriage) dreams of the coming astronauts through telepathy. Her husband, though he pretends to deny the reality of the dreams, becomes bitterly jealous, sensing his wife's confused romantic feelings for one of the astronauts. He kills the two-man expedition, astronauts Nathaniel York and Bert Conover, as soon as they arrive. Mission control on Earth does not know the fate of the crew, and one of the senior astronauts Jeff Spender urges the project director Col. John Wilder to abandon the Zeus project because of concerns that Mars may already harbor life. Wilder (who has shepherded the project for ten years) refuses, among other things because he believes mankind might escape environmental pollution and war on Earth by colonizing Mars instead.
A second mission is launched and the "Zeus II" crew lands on Mars in April 2000. To their amazement the crew (astronauts Arthur Black, Sam Hinkston, and David Lustig) discover that they have landed in a town that looks exactly like Green Bluff, Illinois, circa 1979. They are warmly greeted by close relatives and loved ones who all died years ago. In fact, the Martians use the memories of the astronauts to lure them into their old homes, where they are killed in the middle of the night.
A third mission, "Zeus III", lands on Mars in June 2001. It is commanded by Col. Wilder himself with five other astronauts (Spender, Parkhill, Briggs, Cook, McClure) as subordinates. The crew discovers five ancient cities in the vicinity of the spacecraft, one of which apparently was inhabited only a few weeks ago. The scientists find that all of the Martians have died of chicken pox accidentally brought from Earth by the first two Zeus crews. The men, except for the archaeologist Spender and Colonel Wilder, break out the alcohol rations and begin to celebrate their successful landing, becoming more boisterous. When Briggs starts dropping empty wine bottles into a clear blue canal, Spender loses his temper and punches him into the canal. He leaves the rest of the landing party to explore Martian ruins; when he returns, he is in possession of a Martian weapon and acting strangely. He kills the other astronauts except for Parkhill and Wilder, who shoots Spender in the chest before he has the opportunity to kill them as well.
The Settlers.
"Episode 2, 28 January 1980"
In the second episode, Wilder returns to the Red Planet in February 2004 with an entire fleet of spaceships, having been appointed director of the American colonization of Mars. In six months, a dozen communities are laid down. These sites, named after the Zeus mission astronauts, include: "York Plain," "Blackville," "Wilder Mountain," "Spender Hill," "Briggs Canal," and "Lustig Creek." The colonies grow rapidly over the next two years with varying amounts of success, as the colonists bring the vices of Earth (greed, corruption, bureaucracy) with them.
In September 2006, the Martian colonists start to encounter strange phenomena. A pair of newly-arrived missionaries, Father Peregrine and Father Stone, are rescued from a landslide by a group of mysterious blue lights. Father Stone wants to return to First Town, but Father Peregrine insists on seeking out the blue lights; when he leaves his sleeping companion and climbs to the top of a cliff and steps off, one of them appears and saves him again. They reveal themselves to be non-corporeal Martians from over 250 million years ago who live in the hills, supposedly at one with God. They tell Father Peregrine, who has vowed to build a church in the hills with a blue sphere in place of a cross, to return to his own people and minister to them.
David Lustig, presumed dead six years ago with the rest of Earth's Second Expedition to Mars, returns to his colonist parents in Lustig Creek. He expresses an intense aversion to visiting First Town, the chief colony on Mars; when his parents insist on going there anyway, he suddenly goes missing. 
Father Peregrine later sees a vision of Jesus Christ in his church in First Town, but the vision begs for release: "I am not what I seem! I am not that vision!" Peregrine realizes that his visitor is actually a Martian who is forced to appear as anyone that others have strong thoughts of: David Lustig, Jesus, Lavinia Spaulding (the lost daughter of another settler couple), etc. The Martian is discovered, pursued and eventually surrounded by the residents of First Town, each of whom sees and wants him to be someone different. Under telepathic pressure to be everyone to everyone simultaneously, he dies and his body disappears. Meanwhile, nuclear war is imminent on Earth. Congress cuts the budget for space exploration, all flights to Mars are cancelled, and the colony is evacuated.
The final segment of the episode focuses on Sam Parkhill, the only survivor (aside from Wilder) of the third Zeus mission. He has opened a diner on Mars with his wife, intending to serve future truckers and mine workers. When a lone Martian suddenly appears in the diner, Parkhill panics and shoots him. Numerous Martians appear in sand ships, and Parkhill takes his wife to his very own sand ship and flees. Parkhill manages to shoot several more of them, but the Martians eventually catch up and surround the couple's ship. To Parkhill's great surprise, they bear him no ill will; in fact, they give him a land grant to half of Mars and a message: "The night is tonight. Prepare." Unfortunately, the expected fleet of ten thousand rockets filled with one hundred thousand "hungry customers" will not be coming; instead, as Parkhill views Earth through a telescope, he sees it destroyed in nuclear fire.
The Martians.
"Episode 3, 29 January 1980"
As established at the end of the second episode, Mars was evacuated shortly before a worldwide nuclear war terminated all life on Earth. Wilder travels back to Earth in November 2006 in the hope he can rescue his brother and his family. He returns to the Zeus project mission control facility but discovers a video recording the deaths of everyone, including his brother, when enemy neutron bombs detonated nearby.
Meanwhile, Peter Hathaway has retired on Mars with his wife, Alice, and daughter, Margarite. A mechanical tinkerer, Hathaway has wired an abandoned town below his house to sound alive at night with noise and phone calls. One night, Hathaway sights a rocket in orbit and puts on a laser light show to signal the rocket. 
Only a few scattered humans remain on Mars. One of them is Benjamin Driscoll, the lone inhabitant of First Town. One day, as he wanders around the abandoned settlement, he hears a telephone ringing. Initially confused, he soon realizes it is an opportunity for companionship. After breaking into a home just in time to miss another call, Driscoll sits down with a phone book of Mars and starts dialing at A. After days of no answers, he changes his strategy and starts calling hotels; then, guessing where he thinks a woman would most likely spend her time, he calls the biggest beauty salon on Mars, in New Texas City. When a woman answers, he flies 1,500 miles to New Texas City to meet her.
Genevieve Selsor turns out to be thoroughly narcissistic and entirely obsessed with her own good looks. Driscoll asks her out on a date, during which she reveals that she decided to stay behind simply because "they wouldn't let me take all my clothes with me back to Earth." She enjoys having access to all the clothes, makeup, footwear, and so forth in New Texas City without having to pay for anything. At the same time, she laments that she has to do all the cooking and technical maintenance herself. She rejects Driscoll's advances but still expects him to make a nice breakfast while repairing her sauna. This is a significant departure from the original 1950 short story, "Silent Towns", in which Selsor is not self-absorbed and expectant of Driscoll's labor; instead, she is overweight, sticky with chocolate and desires to watch movies. The male character (named Walter Gripp in the original) finds her too expectant and clingy, as she shows Gripp her ideal wedding dress. In both versions of the story, Gripp/Driscoll decides that solitude is preferable to her continued company and abandons her.
Hathaway at first he thinks his attempt has failed, but the rocket returns to land. It carries Father Stone and Colonel Wilder, who have returned from Earth. They reunite with Hathaway, who is troubled by his heart when they break the news of Earth's nuclear destruction, but brings the crew to his house for breakfast. Wilder remarks that Alice looks just as she was as when he last saw her, at their wedding. After breakfast, Wilder explores the surrounding area, particularly some headstones he saw earlier. He returns, pale, having learned that Hathaway's wife and daughter died in July 2000 from an unknown virus.
As the Hathaways toast their guests, Peter Hathaway's heart finally fails. As he dies, he begs Wilder not to call his family because they "would not understand." Wilder then confirms that Alice and Margarite are robots built by Hathaway to replace the dead originals. Wilder and Stone depart, and the robots continue with their meaningless daily rituals until the chance arrival of Ben Driscoll. The Hathaway robots appear relieved when Driscoll decides to stay with them.
In March 2007, Wilder visits Sam Parkhill again to inform him that the Earth has been destroyed and Mars is all they have left. Parkhill tells him about the "land grant" that he received from the Martians. Wilder suspects that the Martians were somehow aware of the coming war. He comes to the conclusion that the Martians desired to give the other half of their own desolate planet away to the survivors of the Earth colony, such that each surviving civilization could develop once more.
Traveling the wastes alone by night, Wilder has a long-wished-for encounter with a Martian. Each sees the Mars he is accustomed to: Wilder sees ruins, while the Martian sees a living city with a festival in progress. Each seems to be an immaterial phantom to the other. Neither knows if he precedes the other in time, as they each argue that the other resides in the distant past. Despite this, they manage to come to an accord, with the Martian explaining what he can of their way of life before he and Wilder part as friends. Wilder then takes his family into the ruins of a Martian city, saying that they will live there and learn the Martian way. The first night, he burns copies of and "The Wealth of Nations." After promising his family that they will get to see real Martians, he points at their reflection in a pool of water and declares, ""Those" are the Martians". Finally, he pushes a button on his remote control to blow up the last remaining rocketship which could return them to Earth.
Production.
Filming.
The series was filmed at Shepperton Studios in England and on both the Mediterranean island of Malta and Lanzarote in the Canary Islands.
Soundtrack.
In 2002, the Airstrip One Company in association with MGM Music, released a 3000 copy, limited edition 36 track soundtrack CD of the original Stanley Myers score recorded in 1979. This release, still available from rare Film &amp; TV soundtrack specialists, includes a comprehensive 18-page full color and fully illustrated booklet which details various aspects of the making of this mini-series. The catalogue number of this CD is AOD 003. The CD comprises the full miniseries soundtrack, with a notable exception: the track the Silver Locusts is a shorter, completely different piece than the version that was aired. Also, the soundtrack is missing a few incidental electronic music passages. This omission is acknowledged in the CD liner notes which indicate that additional electronic music by Richard Harvey has not been included in the soundtrack.
Reception.
Ray Bradbury described the miniseries as "just boring".

In 1396, its territory was combined with Preonzo, to form a single village community. In 1403–22 it was part of the Uri and Obwalden dominated Levantine district. This situation lasted until Bellinzona moved against the Confederates. During these years, the confederation officers recognized, the rights and customary law of Moleno and Preonzo.
The parish church of S. Vittore was built in the 13th century. In the 15th century it was rebuilt and in 1542, it broke away from the church at Biasca. Moleno, Gnosca and Preonzo were the three municipalities in the district of Bellinzona where the Ambrosian Rite was followed in the churches.

Monte Carasso

Monte Carasso is a former municipality in the district of Bellinzona in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
On 2 April 2017 the former municipalities of Camorino, Claro, Giubiasco, Gnosca, Gorduno, Gudo, Moleno, Pianezzo, Preonzo, Sant'Antonio and Sementina merged into the municipality of Bellinzona.
The Swiss Heritage Society chose Monte Carasso for the 1993 Wakker Prize.
History.
Monte Carasso is first mentioned in 1348 as "Monte Carassio". In the Middle Ages and the early modern period, the residents of Monte Casasso had a permanent right to appoint representatives in the Council of Bellinzona. The inhabitants of the four village that made up the municipality lived mainly in the various groups on the mountain. As of 1506 the villagers of Monte Carasso possessed transportation rights across the river Ticino. The ferry was an important link across the river, as the "Torretta" Bridge was destroyed in 1515 and wasn't rebuilt until 1815.
In 1634 the church of Monte Carasso separated from the parish of Bellinzona. The parish church of Saints Bernardino and Jerome was probably built in the late 15th century on the site of a Roman oratory and affiliated with an Augustinian convent. The church separated from the convent of S. Maria Elisabetta in Como in 1555. It was restored in 1905–06.
The church of San Bernardo dates back to the 12th-13th centuries and contains important frescoes of the Seregneser masters from the 15th century. The chapel of Madonna della Valle was built in the 17th century. The Church of SS. Trinità was finished in 1655.
Grazing and cultivation were for centuries the main source of income for the population. From the mid-19th century, there were a large number of former residents who emigrated overseas. To create jobs for the Lombardy refugees in Switzerland, in 1853 the so-called Fortini della fame fortifications were built. After a project by Luigi Snozzi the village was renovated in the 1980s. The first stage, between 1987 and 1993, was the restoration of the former Augustinian convent, which today houses the primary school and cultural center. In 1998 the "Fondazione Curzutt" was founded with the aim of reviving the old settlement on the Collina Alta above Monte Carasson. In 2000, three quarters of workers were employed outside of the municipality.

Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (Northern Ireland)

The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL; ; ) was a devolved government department in the Northern Ireland Executive. The minister with overall responsibility for the department was the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure.
After the election to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2016, the DCAL was closed and its roles and functions were amalgamated with other departments in order to reduce the size of the Northern Ireland Executive.
Aim.
DCAL's overall vision was a "confident, creative, informed and healthy society". It described its mission as delivering economic growth and enhancing the quality of life in Northern Ireland by "unlocking the full potential of the culture, arts and leisure sectors."
The last Minister was Carál Ní Chuilín (Sinn Féin). The Minister was, by virtue of office, the Keeper of the Records for Northern Ireland.
Responsibilities.
The department had the following main responsibilities:
Broadcasting, intellectual property and the administration of the National Lottery are reserved to Westminster and are therefore not devolved.
DCAL's main counterparts in the United Kingdom Government were:
Its main counterparts in the Irish Government were:
History.
Following a referendum on the Belfast Agreement on 23 May 1998 and the granting of royal assent to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 on 19 November 1998, a Northern Ireland Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive were established by the United Kingdom Government under Prime Minister Tony Blair. The process was known as devolution and was set up to return devolved legislative powers to Northern Ireland. DCAL was one of five new devolved Northern Ireland departments created in December 1999 by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999.
A devolved minister first took office on 2 December 1999. Devolution was suspended for four periods, during which the department came under the responsibility of direct rule ministers from the Northern Ireland Office:
Under the St Andrews Agreement (signed 13 October 2006), the Executive is obliged to adopt strategies on enhancing and protecting the development of the Irish language and enhancing and developing Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture. The agreement also committed the United Kingdom Government to introducing "an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and Ireland". Welsh and Irish are official languages in those respective countries.
Language policy was devolved, alongside the department's other responsibilities, on 8 May 2007. As of March 2012, neither an Irish language strategy or act, nor an Ulster Scots strategy, had been adopted. The department stated that a "Strategy for Indigenous or Regional Minority Languages" would "be presented to the Executive in due course".

Go — The International Travel Game, later Travel Go, is a family board game, based on international travel, which was manufactured by Waddingtons Ltd from 1961 onwards. The objective of the game is to travel the world by air, sea, rail and road, collect a predetermined number of souvenirs from each city visited, and to return to the starting point (London). The board is in two parts, and each player has a counter on each part. The outer edge is where the player moves when in a city, and is where money can be changed and tickets purchased. The inner part is a world map marked with travel routes between major cities. The map also shows remote locations (such as Heard Island) to which a player might be diverted by a "storm" following the drawing of a "risk" card by landing on a hazard marker while travelling.

Pianezzo

Pianezzo is a former municipality in the district of Bellinzona in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
On 2 April 2017 the former municipalities of Camorino, Claro, Giubiasco, Gnosca, Gorduno, Gudo, Moleno, Monte Carasso, Preonzo, Sant'Antonio and Sementina merged into the municipality of Bellinzona.
History.
In 1905, a major burial ground from the Iron Age came to light, which seems to be from the Golasecca culture. Objects found in the graves indicate that the settlement was also in contact with residents of the Alpine region. East of the city there are also some medieval ruins, which are probably built on the site of a Roman era customs post or even a pre-Roman settlement.
Pianezzo is first mentioned in 1382 as "Planezio". In the 15th century the Church of S. Pietro in Bellinzona possessed vineyards and farmsteads in Pianezzo. In the Middle Ages, portions of the village formed part of the community of Vallemorobbia. In 1803 this community became the political municipality of Vallemorobbia. In 1831 it became independent after the old municipality was divided into three new municipalities; Pianezzo, Sant'Antonio and Vallemorobbia in Piano.
The village church was under the Mother Church in Bellinzona until 1600, followed by the Church of SS Giacomo e Filippo. In the 16th century, a new church was built on the ruins of an earlier church. It was renovated in 1960–70 and 2002–03. In 1680 Pianezzo became an independent parish.
Some of the tower houses in the village still show the typical construction of rural houses in the Valle Morobbia.
The local economy was based on traditional agriculture and animal husbandry. Even today the vineyards are operated as a sideline business. There are a number of second or vacation homes in the village. At the beginning of the 21st century more than three-quarters of workers in Pianezzo commuted to Bellinzona and Giubiasco.

Hans Denck

Hans Denck ( – November 27, 1527) was a German theologian and Anabaptist leader during the Reformation.
Biography.
Denck was born in 1495 in the Bavarian town of Habach. He entered the University of Ingolstadt on October 10, 1517, and graduated in 1519. Denck began working as a family tutor in Niederstotzingen. By the recommendation of Johannes Oecolampadius, Denck became headmaster at the St. Sebaldus school in Nuremberg in 1523. He became involved in the trial of the artist brothers Sebald and Barthel Beham, who were expelled from the city in 1524 at the instigation of Andreas Osiander. In Nuremberg, he met Thomas Müntzer, and so first came in contact with radical theology, which he accepted with modifications. In consequence of his convictions, he was banished from Nuremberg in January 1524, and forced upon a wandering life, which he henceforth led until his death.
In 1525 he went to Augsburg where he met in April 1526 Balthasar Hubmaier who impressed him very much and who most probably baptized him. In late 1526 he fled from there and arrived in Strasbourg in November 1526 where he stayed with Ludwig Haetzer, a like-minded Anabaptist. He was also expelled from there, and after a long time of wandering in Southern Germany and Switzerland he found refuge with Johannes Oekolampad in Basel. After attending the Martyrs' Synod in Augsburg, he returned to Basel where he died in 1527 of bubonic plague. In his writings he fiercely attacked the reformers; together with Haetzer he translated the Biblical books of the Prophets into German (Worms 1527).
Theology.
Denck was influenced by the German theologian Johannes Tauler's mysticism. For Denck the living, inner word of God was more important than the letters of the Scripture. This belief was contrary to the Lutheran belief of giving scripture primacy. Denck thought of the Bible as a human product, the individual books being different witnesses of one truth. He did not value the scripture as the source of all true religious knowledge, but instead the spirit that speaks from within each person. For Denck the sacraments were only symbols: baptism a sign of commitment, communion a ceremony of remembrance.
Denck held that Christ is the embodiment the perfect person, never separated from God because he has always done God's will. Thus does Christ serve as model. Luther taught the doctrine of justification by faith whereas Denck's whole emphasis was put instead on discipleship to Jesus. Indeed, his motto was: "No one may truly know Christ except one who follows Him in life".
It is not clear if Denck was Anti-Trinitarian. His enemies as well as modern Unitarian scholars have presented him as Anti-Trinitarian, despite the lack of evidence of this in Denck's own writings. Clearly though, he was a non-dogmatic Christian.
Joachim Vadian and Johann Kessler accused Denck of Universalism, but according to Ludlow, he merely hoped for the salvation of all, and his accusers were mistaken or trying to discredit him. However, Ludlow was unaware of a lesser-known account by sympathetic pastor Sigelsbach of a conversation where Denck said it was "evident that the blasphemy of the damned will stop in the end". Moreover, Urbanus Rhegius wrote how Denck confessed to him, after over a year of denying, "that he believed that no man or devil was eternally damned".
Denck's universalism sprang from his convictions that God is always merciful because He is love, loves His enemies as He teaches us to love ours, uses only corrective albeit sometimes painful and long-lasting ("eternal") punishment, and draws everyone back to unity in Him. Origen's influence probably played a role. Unlike Origen, though, it seems that Denck avoided writing about universalism for fear of the authorities and preached it instead. After Denck's death, universalism was reportedly confessed by an Anabaptist imprisoned for heresy in 1528, and Denck's student Clement Ziegler published two treatises defending it in 1532, though he would keep quiet about it the last 20 years of his life.

Preonzo

Preonzo is a former municipality in the district of Bellinzona in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
On 2 April 2017, the former municipalities of Camorino, Claro, Giubiasco, Gnosca, Gorduno, Moleno, Monte Carasso, Pianezzo, Sant'Antonio and Sementina merged into the municipality of Bellinzona.
History.
Preonzo is first mentioned in 1335 as "Prevonzo". In the 14th century, Moleno and Preonzo formed a settlement. In 1335 it became a municipality in the County of Bellinzona. During the first conquest of the Ticino in 1403–22, it was ruled by the cantons of Uri and Obwalden. They granted the villages its statutes and customary rights ("Statuti", "ordini"), although, in contrast to Moleno, it was not incorporated in the Levantine.
The parish church of SS Simone e Giuda was built in 1459. In the 17th century it was rebuilt and then renovated in 1963–66 and 1996–97. It broke away from the Church of S. Vittore in Moleno in 1545. Together with Gnosca and Moleno it was one of the three churches that used the Ambrosian Rite in the County of Bellinzona.
Traditionally, the village economy was based mostly on alpine pasturage and agriculture. However, by 2005, only 13% of jobs were in agriculture, while 56% were in manufacturing. More than three-quarters of workers commuted to Biasca and Bellinzona.
Geography.
Preonzo has an area, , of . Of this area, or 7.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 60.4% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 3.3% is settled (buildings or roads), or 2.4% is either rivers or lakes and or 25.0% is unproductive land.

The municipality is located in the Bellinzona district, on the right bank of the Ticino river between Bellinzona and Biasca.
The rockslide of Valegión.
The rock wall ("Valegión", "Purscì") at Alpe di Roscioro (or Roscèro) at above sea level about from the Preonzo industrial park has collapsed several times in the past centuries. In 1702, 1725, and 1747, rock slides and debris destroyed parts of the old town, and boulders have been found over from the base of the slope.
In the 1970s, a small retaining wall for of rock was built in preparation for construction of the motorway in the following decade.
In 1998, the industrial park expanded and another, larger retaining wall with a capacity of between and was built.
Between 1999 and 2003, a number of sensors were placed on the rock wall to study factors leading up to rock slides.
In 2001, two landslides descended from the "Riale Valegión":
These events induced the authorities to increase the capacity of the largest retaining wall from to about . The retaining wall was completed in the end of 2002.
On 7–8 May 2002, about of rock fell over 7 hours during heavy rain from Roscioro. Only a few boulders reached the partly completed retaining wall.
During the night of 14–15 May 2012, there was a major rockslide above Preonzo which resulted in no deaths or damaged buildings, but did cause road closures (at intervals even the motorway). About of rock collapsed on 14–15 May with another of rock that could potentially fall in future.

Icovellauna

Icovellauna was a Celtic goddess worshiped in Gaul. Her places of worship included an octagonal temple at Le Sablon in Metz, originally built over a spring, from which five inscriptions dedicated to her have been recovered, and Trier, where Icovellauna was honored in an inscription in the Altbachtal temple complex. Both of these places lie in the valley of the river Moselle of eastern Gaul in what are now Lorraine in France and Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany. One such inscription was, somewhat unusually, inscribed on a copper tablet in Roman cursive letters.
At the temple in Metz, a spiral staircase led down to the water level, allowing worshipers to leave offerings in the spring and/or to take the waters. A statuette of a local Gaulish Mercury was among the ex-votos deposited at the shrine, which also included coins and ceramics dating from the 2nd to 4th centuries CE. Jeanne-Marie Demarolle states that Apollo was also associated with Icovellauna.
Demarolle glosses the name Icovellauna as "bonne fontaine" or "good fountain". Miranda Green follows Joseph Vendryes in interpreting the Gaulish root "ico-" as "water" and characterizes Icovellauna as a "water goddess" who "presided over the nymphaeum at Sablon in the Moselle Basin, a thermal spring-site". Xavier Delamarre, however, considers Vendryes' interpretation to be very improbable; on purely etymological grounds, he suggests that "ico-" might be the name of a bird, perhaps the woodpecker. The root "uellauno-" has been variously interpreted, though the interpretation "chief, commander" has recently found favor; see Vellaunus.

Fonds de solidarité FTQ

The largest development capital network in the province, the Fonds de solidarité FTQ was created on the initiative of the FTQ, Québec's largest central labour body.
As of November 30, 2022, the Fonds held $17.8 billion in net assets and had more than 753,000 owner-shareholders.
Constituting act.
The Fonds de solidarité FTQ was constituted on June 23, 1983 by an act of the Québec National Assembly, then headed by the René Lévesque government. The initial capital came from workers affiliated to FTQ that was complemented by provincial and federal governments.
Business financing.
For the last 5 years, the Fonds had invested an average of $771 million per year in Québec companies. It is a partner, either directly or through one of its network members, in over 2,839 Québec companies.
RRSP.
Fonds shares, which are eligible for the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), can be purchased by any Québec taxpayer either through payroll deduction – available in unionized companies or government organizations (an FTQ-affiliated or other union), – preauthorized withdrawals, or a lump sum payment. Anyone can purchase Fonds shares.
In its 36-year history, the Fonds has sold $16.7 billion in shares. The Fonds relies on a network of over 2,600 local representatives—unionized employees who promote the Fonds RRSP in their workplace.
Fonds shares are a popular investment because in addition to the tax benefits individuals obtain for buying an RRSP, they also receive two additional tax credits: 15% from each government (Québec and Canada) on the first $5,000 invested each year. Fonds shares cannot be sold before retirement except under certain conditions such as loss of employment, participation in the federal government's Home Buyers’ Plan, and disability.

KC HiLiTES

KC HiLiTES, Inc is a manufacturer of off-road lighting and roof racks, based in Williams, Arizona.
History.
The company was founded in 1970 in Saugus, California by Peter Kim Brown and his wife Carol Brown, and named using their initials. They were spurred to start the company when Peter began using landing lights from aircraft adapted to fit his truck, and realized that the way they were mounted would not stand up to the rigors of use of the off-road community of race buggies and pickups. Available lighting at the time was limited to 55-watt halogen lamps that were in Brown's words, "really disappointing in the desert". Initially he made a few sets for friends, but eventually began working with neighbors out of his garage assembling the lights, building the wiring harnesses and selling the packages to off-roaders and local shops. In 1974, the company was moved to Williams, Arizona where it remains today. Many race teams use KC's lamps, included pioneers Walker Evans and Ivan Stewart. Peter's step-son Michael Dehaas was the company owner for over a decade after purchasing it in 2004, and it is now owned by family members - Alan, Andy, and Mike.
Products.
The company's best-known product is the Daylighter off-road lamp. KC designed the special patented isolated rubber mount for the Daylighter when they noticed too many failures due to the severe vibration within the metal housing during off-road use. The firm worked with GE engineers over the intricacies of lighting, sealed beams, filaments, the varied types of construction, wattage and candlepower in order to devise a way to completely encircle the bulb in rubber, helping isolate it from damaging vibrations. In addition to the Daylighter, KC manufactured a wide variety of halogen products through the late 1990s, including flood lamps and driving lamps.
In addition to forward facing lights intended for either on- or off-road use, KC also offered accessories in their early years, including glare shields, interior map lights, and theft-deterrent light locks (security nuts).
In the 1990s, KC developed high-intensity discharge (HID) lighting, based on metal-halide technology. More recently, KC offers HIDs and LEDs for off-road use, and for commercial and industrial applications.
KC introduced a line of roof racks in 2025.

Dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve

The dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve (or posterior nucleus of vagus nerve or dorsal vagal nucleus or nucleus dorsalis nervi vagi or nucleus posterior nervi vagi) is a cranial nerve nucleus of the vagus nerve (CN X) situated in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem ventral to the floor of the fourth ventricle. It contains nerve cell bodies of parasympathetic neurons of CN X that provide parasympathetic innervation to the gastrointestinal tract and lungs as well as other thoracic and abdominal organs. These functions include, among others, bronchoconstriction and gland secretion.
Cell bodies of pre-ganglionic parasympathetic neurons of CN X that innervate the heart meanwhile reside in the nucleus ambiguus, and additional cell bodies of the nucleus ambiguus give rise to the branchial efferent motor fibers of the vagus nerve (CN X) terminating in the laryngeal, and pharyngeal muscles, and musculus uvulae muscle.

Coop Norge

Coop Norge is a Norwegian cooperative. It is owned by 117 local cooperatives with approximately 2 million members. The company has its headquarters in Oslo.
History.
The first cooperative store in Norway was opened in the 1850s and, on 27 June 1906, a group of 28 cooperatives formed the NKL ("Norges Kooperative Landsforening", "Norwegian Cooperative Association") to act as a wholesaler for its members. The next year, it joined the International Co-operative Alliance.
NKL acquired the Norwegian Margarine Factory ("Margarinfabrikken Norge") in Bergen in 1911; it later purchased other margarine factories in Oslo and Bodø. It purchased a cigarette factory in 1914 and a coffee plant in 1916. During the 1920s, it began production of shoes and flour; during the 1930s, it added chocolate and light bulbs as well as Cooperative Insurance ("Samvirke Forsikring"). NKL opened the first self-serve store in Norway on 1 October 1947 and, in 1951, the law was changed to permit cooperatives to open branch stores and to sell goods to non-members. In the 1950s, its Tormolux division produced washing machines and mopeds; in the 1960s, it began use of the S brand and opened the warehouse chain Domus. Obs! was established as a separate chain in 1975, and the next year NKL purchased Røra Fabrikker, an Inderøy-based producer of jams and juices. Prix was introduced in 1990.
In 2000, NKL rebranded itself as Coop NKL. In 2001, in collaboration with Sweden's KF and Denmark's FDB, it established Coop Norden AB and rebranded its own operations as Coop NKL. Coop Norden was dissolved in 2008 and Coop NKL resumed control of its outlets in Norway as Coop Norge SA.
Membership.
Members of Coop belong to one or more of the local cooperatives. Each member must make a cash deposit of NOK 100–300. The deposit and some interest is redeemable upon cancellation of the membership. The local cooperatives operate the association's stores and are led by boards elected by the membership. Dividends are paid out based on a percentage of the amount purchased.
Operations.
Coop stores include the following divisions:
Subsidiaries.
Coop Norge wholly owns Coop Norge Handel AS, its production and trade company; Coop Norge Eiendom AS, its real estate management company; and Smart Club AS, a separate retail chain.
Coop Norge Handel.
Coop Norge Handel AS ("Norwegian Coop Trading Co.") controls Coop's production and trading operations. Its wholly owned subsidiaries include Coop Norge Industri AS and four property companies. It has stakes in a potato-packing plant in Grinder, Takecargo AS in Lysaker, and John Weydahl AS and the Grocery Supplier's Environmental Forum in Oslo. It also has stakes in Coop Trading A/S and NAF Trading A/S in Denmark and Coop Norden Bygg Inköp AB, a construction supply firm, in Sweden.
Coop Norge Industri.
Coop Norge Industri's subsidiaries include Coop Norge Kaffe AS, AS Margarinfabrikken Norge, and Smart Club Gourmet AS in Oslo; Røra Fabrikker in Inderøy; and Gomanbakeren Holding AS in Sandnes, which operates subsidiary bakeries around Norway.

HMS Nile (1888)

HMS "Nile" was one of two battleships built for the Royal Navy during the 1880s. Late deliveries of her main guns delayed her commissioning until 1891 and she spent most of the decade with the Mediterranean Fleet. "Nile" returned home in 1898 and became the coast guard ship at Devonport for five years before she was placed in reserve in 1903. The ship was sold for scrap in 1912 and broken up at Swansea, Wales.
Design and description.
The design of the "Trafalgar"-class ships was derived from the layout of the earlier ironclad battleship and the , coupled with the heavy armour of the preceding . The "Trafalgar"s displaced ; the addition of more armour and ammunition during construction added an additional of weight and increased their draught by a foot (0.3 m) below their designed waterline. They had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of , and a draught of . "Nile"s crew consisted of 537 officers and ratings in 1903 and 527 two years later. The low freeboard of the "Trafalgar"s made them very wet and they could not maintain full speed except in a calm.
The ships were powered by a pair of three-cylinder, vertical inverted, triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which were designed to produce a total of and a maximum speed of using steam provided by six cylindrical boilers with forced draught. During her sea trials, "Nile" slightly exceeded this with a speed of from . The "Trafalgar" class carried a maximum of of coal which gave them a range of at a speed of .
Armament and armour.
The "Trafalgar"-class ships' main armament consisted of four breech-loading (BL) guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. Each gun was provided with 80 rounds. The muzzles of these guns were only above the deck, and were very hard to fight in a seaway due to the spray breaking over the forward turret.
Their secondary armament was originally planned to consist of eight BL guns, but these were replaced during construction by six quick-firing (QF) guns. 200 rounds per gun were carried by the ships. Eight QF 6-pounder and nine QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. The ships carried four 14-inch (356 mm) torpedo tubes and another pair were added in August 1890.
The "Trafalgar"s' armour scheme was similar to that of "Dreadnought", although the waterline belt of compound armour did not cover the complete length of the ship and a deck extended fore and aft of the armoured citadel to the bow and stern. The belt was long and was thick; it was closed off by traverse bulkheads. Above it was a strake of armour that covered the bases of the gun turrets. Another strake above that protected the secondary armament and was thick. The sides of the gun turrets were 18 inches thick and the conning tower was protected by 14-inch plates.
Construction and career.
"Nile", named after the Battle of the Nile, was the third ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. She was laid down on 8 April 1886 by Pembroke Dockyard. The ship was launched on 27 March 1888 by Lady Maud Hamilton, wife of Lord George Hamilton, First Lord of the Admiralty. She was completed in July 1890, although her main guns were not delivered until the following year, at a cost of £885,718.
After delivery, she was commissioned at Portsmouth on 30 June 1891 for manoeuvres, following which she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. When the battleships "Victoria" and "Camperdown" collided on 22 June 1893, "Nile" was next astern and it was only through the skillful manoeuvring of Captain Gerard Noel that his ship was not also involved in the collision. "Nile" had her 4.7-inch guns replaced by QF guns in 1896. She came home in January 1898 to become the port guardship at Devonport. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. She paid off at Devonport in February 1903, when her captain and crew transferred to HMS "Royal Oak" which took her place in the Home Fleet. The "Nile" was relegated to the reserve at Devonport, where she remained until she was sold on 9 July 1912 for £34,000 to be broken up at Swansea by Thos. W. Ward.

S.C. Farense

Sporting Clube Farense, simply known as Farense, is a Portuguese professional football club based in Faro in the district of the same name and the region of Algarve. Founded in 1910, the club has played in the Primeira Liga since the 2023–24 season after promotion from the Liga Portugal 2.
History.
Founded on 1 April 1910, it became the branch number 2 of Sporting Clube de Portugal (Sporting CP). Its main kit was inspired by the classic Sporting CP Stromp kit which was the main kit of the Lisbon-based team until 1928. In its entire history, the club has won nine major trophies: the AF Algarve Championship five times, the Segunda Divisão twice, and the Terceira Divisão and AF Algarve First and Second Divisions once each. Aside from its major trophies, the club as of 2013, has played 23 seasons in the Primeira Liga of which their highest league table classification came in the 1994–95 season where they managed a fifth-place finish.
On the back of that best-ever finish, Farense qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time, losing in the first round to Olympique Lyonnais by a single goal in each game.&lt; The club also reached the final of the Taça de Portugal in 1990 where they lost to Estrela da Amadora. Among the mainstays of their 1990s teams were the Moroccan attacking duo of Hajry Redouane and Hassan Nader.
The 2001–02 season saw the club relegated to the second tier of Portuguese football. In 2006, the club was in the sixth tier, the second district league of the Algarve Football Association, but won two consecutive promotions as champions. In 2012–13 they were promoted to the Segunda Liga. In 2019–20, after the season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the club were promoted back to the top flight after 18 years, under manager Sérgio Vieira. One year later, they were relegated on the final matchday after a 4–0 loss at C.D. Santa Clara.
On 3 February 2023, Farense sacked manager Vasco Faísca before a match against Estrela da Amadora, who had cut their advantage in second place to one point. His replacement José Mota led the club back to the Primeira Liga. He was fired after a poor start to the Primeira Liga and replaced by Tozé on September 25th, 2024.
Stadium.
The "Leões de Faro" played at the Estádio de São Luís for 94 years from 1910. The club moved stadium in 2004 to the newly constructed Estádio Algarve which was built for the purpose of hosting matches at UEFA Euro 2004. The Faro side moved back to the Estádio de São Luís in 2013 after it gained promotion to the Segunda Liga. As a result of their promotion, the Estádio de São Luís underwent major renovations to improve its facilities.
Rivalries.
The club has rivalries with fellow Algarve clubs S.C. Olhanense and Portimonense S.C.

Meijer de Haan

Meijer Isaac de Haan (Amsterdam, 14 April 1852 – Amsterdam, 24 October 1895) was a Dutch painter. In French the name was written Meyer de Haan.
Biography.
He was born into a successful Jewish family of bread and matzo bakers who held to conservative views of religion, music and art. His maternal grandfather was a rich fabric merchant who owned several residential buildings.
An interest in fine art brought him to apprentice with the painter Petrus Franciscus Greive. In 1874, he was accepted into the Rijksacademie van beeldende kunsten at Amsterdam, but performed poorly. In 1880, one of his works was exhibited at the Paris Salon of that year. That same year, an illustration of de Haan's picture "Een moeilijke plaats in de Talmoed" appeared in the newspaper "Eigen Haard", which generated much published discussion (not so much aesthetic as theological). He enjoyed some success in the Netherlands as a painter of Jewish genre works. In Amsterdam de Haan painted portraits and took on several pupils, including Joseph Jacob Isaacson, Louis Hartz and Baruch Lopes Leão de Laguna.
De Haan remained in Amsterdam until 1888, where he produced chiefly portraiture, and representations of working class Jews. His early work was inspired above all by the masters of the Dutch school, such as David Teniers and Rembrandt. The example of 17th century painting is reflected in his history painting of 1877–1888, "Uriel Acosta". The critic I.N. Stemming (nom de plume of the painting Maurits van der Valk) disparaged the painting as "nothing more than a desiccated memory of Rembrandt and Munkaczy." De Haan had toiled for ten years on this magnum opus, which showed the rabbinical judgment against the 17th century Jewish philosopher Uriel Acosta over his opinion about the immortality of the soul. The displeasure the painting ignited in orthodox Jewish circles drove Meyer de Haan to leave for Paris in October 1888 with a monthly allowance from his family, and accompanied by his pupil, Isaacson. There he stayed with the art dealer Theo van Gogh for some months, and met Camille Pissarro. Theo introduced De Haan to his brother Vincent van Gogh, with whom de Haan exchanged several letters.
In May 1889 he travelled to Brittany, where in Pont-Aven he became friendly with Paul Gauguin. The two traveled to Le Pouldu, on the coast of the province for the winter of 1889 through 1890. There, De Haan conducted a liaison with Marie Henry, the owner of the seaside hotel-café "Buvette de la plage", where De Haan and Gauguin lodged in 1890–1891. They covered the walls of the dining area with impressionist murals, such as "Breton Women Stretching Hemp" (1889). The work, papered over in the 1920s, was later uncovered, restored and sold.
Marie Henry gave birth to a daughter, Ida, in the summer of 1891 but De Haan left Le Pouldu and returned to Amsterdam. Though he never saw Marie Henry again, he later left all of his French paintings to Marie and her two daughters. The withdrawal of his family allowance and a sudden illness seem to have prevented Meyer de Haan from following Gauguin to Tahiti in early 1891. He probably returned to the Netherlands in 1891 where he continued to suffer from the ill-health that precipitated his early death.
Today, the bar "Buvette de la plage" has been restored to its former appearance, with modern reproductions installed to replace the original wall paintings.
In 2010, the Musée d'Orsay staged an exhibition of De Haan's work, called "A Master Revealed: Meijer de Haan".

Hinchley Wood

Hinchley Wood is a suburb in the Elmbridge borough of Surrey, England, approximately 13 miles (21 km) south-west of Charing Cross in central London, and within the Greater London Urban Area. It developed largely around its railway station at its heart on the New Guildford Line — and many of its homes house at least one commuter to Central London. The suburb has one main parade of convenience shops, local services and a petrol station; throughout the area is a light smattering of small businesses.
A double-width section of the A309 (the Kingston Bypass) bisects the suburb which acts as a local spur road to a semi-urban section of the motorway-standard A3 road. The suburb's main retail area is directly north of a traffic light intersection adjoined by a large set of retirement flats. The suburb has no high-rise buildings and gained its first place of worship (St Christopher's Church) in 1953. Hinchley Wood has the London dialling code 020.
History.
The only old listed building is the 16th century Old Farm House in the town. Its listing states '... C16 with C18 addition to front left, C19 addition to right. Timber framed core, stuccoed over with plain tiled roofs. Large brick stack to rear and ends. 2 storeys with 2 tripartite wood casements to centre of first floor...' and is now on an ordinary street.
Initially the farmland on which Hinchley Wood was to be built was part of Thames Ditton. In 1925 Esher Council considered a petition from the small number of residents of Manor Road, in which ribbon development from Thames Ditton was taking place, for the provision of a new station between Surbiton and Claygate on the railway that had opened in 1885. The Southern Railway was not interested in a new station; the low population would create negligible new custom; the opening of the Kingston Bypass changed the commercial viability of new station.
Immediately the speculative possibilities created by the bypass were considered. Furthermore, even as it was being built a sewer was laid under it, at Manor Road, to facilitate development. The opening of Hinchley Wood railway station brought about the rapid emergence of Hinchley Wood as a coherent, identifiable settlement, with a housing stock so plainly superior to that typical of the 1930s.
At its annual general meeting in 1927, the chairman called attention to "great increment in the value of the land, which goes into the pockets of vigilant people at our expense". G.T. Crouch agreed to contribute £2,500 towards the cost (about one-third) of the building of the station. Having been given planning permission to build Hinchley Wood in September 1929, Crouch struck a deal with the Southern Railway for the construction of the station. To persuade the Southern Railway to build it, Crouch had to help pay for it. Although the Southern Railway knew that a new settlement would bring new business, it also knew the benefit to Crouch.
After the Second World War, the Inland Revenue had large offices housed in the single storey inter-connected barrack blocks of former Italian Prisoner of War camp on the north side of the railway station. These blocks were eventually demolished to become a very dense turn of the Millennium housing development.
In 1953, the community's church in the Church of England, St. Christophers Church was built.
In 1999 residents took on McDonald's to defeat a plan to take over and convert a public house. The pub had been visited two years before by the Soviet leader from 1985 to 1991 Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife when their flight home to Russia was delayed.
Transportation and growth.
Hinchley Wood railway station was built at the point where conveniently the tracks forked already, making it the more economically built and staffed. Additionally, the regionally monopolised owner-operator, Southern Railway bought some more land on which to build a goods yard, which in the event was never built because competition from road haulage became too great, but the land was retained; ultimately this allowed a car park to be provided.
When the station opened, Hinchley Wood comprised a couple of dozen houses and a petrol filling station (Esher Filling Station, colloquially referred to as "EFS") in a field that bordered the bypass. Development took place around the shops that were built next to the station.
The speed at which the houses in Hinchley Wood were built was phenomenal, with the peak years being in 1933–34 when 750 residents moved in, many of whom were London commuters. The Hinchley Wood Residents' Association was formed in 1931 and quickly became an effective voice for the community on Esher Council.
Hinchley Wood is served by the K3 bus route through Claygate to Esher to the south and through Surbiton to Kingston and Roehampton to the north.
The local authority has varied from Conservative to Residents Association since its 1974 formation.
Countryside and recreation parks.
Many residents visit Littleworth Common, where it meets Esher Eagles Rugby League club, a community rugby club. These are followed by, in the south west, a historic but now small woodland named Hinchley Wood. Telegraph Hill is also southwest of Hinchley Wood and is the largest nearby walking spot and has some visitor attraction for its Grade II (architecture) listed 'Semaphore House' semaphore tower described as "c1822. Rendered brick on projecting plinth with hipped slate roof. 3-storey square tower to centre...C20 glazing bar sash windows throughout".
Education.
Hinchley Wood has two schools, Hinchley Wood Primary School and Hinchley Wood School, one of the main secondary schools in the area, that includes a sixth form.
Demography and housing.
The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the settlement who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).
In the media.
McDonald's rebuffed.
Hinchley Wood has independent cafés and small supermarkets. Nonetheless in 1999 McDonald's sought to widen its reach, by opening a rare pure suburbia outlet. Hinchley Wood residents, organised as Residents Against McDonald's (RAM), took on McDonald's to defeat a plan to turn their local pub into a drive-through fast-food outlet. The residents defeated McDonald's on 16 June 2000 after a 552-day continuous occupation. The pub has since been demolished and has been replaced by retirement flats.
Irreverent jibes.
Hinchley Wood unwittingly featured in an irreverent semi-comical book "Crap Towns" to be ranked "48th worst" in the United Kingdom. In response to the ranking, the local councillor stated "People like it here because it is a quiet place, very convenient for the city and, if you want to get to Kingston, it is easy as well. You have all the peace and quiet you want and it is near the countryside and the rivers. While we do not have a pub we do have a strong community spirit". The town lost the status in later editions.

Department for Communities

The Department for Communities (DfC, Irish: "An Roinn Pobal"; Ulster Scots: "Depairtment fur Commonities") is a devolved Northern Ireland government department in the Northern Ireland Executive. The minister with overall responsibility for the department is the Minister for Communities. The department was previously created in May 2016 following the Fresh Start Agreement and the dissolution of several departments, such as the Department for Social Development, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Department for Employment and Learning from which several functions have amalgamated.
Aim.
DfC's overall aim is "tackling disadvantage and building sustainable communities".
Responsibilities.
The department's main responsibilities are as follows:
Northern Ireland has parity with Great Britain in three areas:
Policy in these areas is technically devolved but, in practice, follows policy set by Parliament to provide consistency across the United Kingdom.
The department is also responsible for the following public bodies:
It also oversees the Office of the Social Fund Commissioner.
Counterpart departments in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
DfC's main counterparts in the United Kingdom Government are:
In the Irish Government, its main counterparts are:
History.
Housing policy in Northern Ireland was originally a responsibility of local government and the Ministry of Home Affairs, which (similarly to the Home Office) retained responsibility for policy areas not delegated to other ministries.
A separate Ministry of Health and Local Government was established in June 1944, as part of the welfare state. In January 1965, that department was divided between the Ministry of Development (including housing policy) and the Ministry of Health and Social Services (including social security).
The two ministries were, respectively, renamed as the Department of the Environment and Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) under direct rule, introduced in March 1972. Health and social services and environment ministries were also included in the Northern Ireland Executive briefly established in 1974.
DfC mainly combined housing and social security policy from those departments.
The initials DHSS are still used locally to describe benefits and benefit claimants.
Following a referendum on the Belfast Agreement on 23 May 1998 and the granting of royal assent to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 on 19 November 1998, a Northern Ireland Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive were established by the United Kingdom Government under Prime Minister Tony Blair. The process was known as devolution and was set up to return devolved legislative powers to Northern Ireland.
DfC (then DSD) was one of five new devolved Northern Ireland departments created in December 1999 by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and The Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999.
A devolved minister first took office on 2 December 1999. Devolution was suspended for four periods, during which the department came under the responsibility of direct rule ministers from the Northern Ireland Office:
Since 8 May 2007, devolution has operated without interruption, however it was not operating in practice from 2017 to 2020.
Ministers for Communities.
Direct rule ministers.
During the periods of suspension, the following ministers of the Northern Ireland Office were responsible for the department:

Werner Erhard (book)

Werner Erhard: The Transformation of a Man, The Founding of est is a biography of Werner Erhard by philosophy professor William Warren Bartley, III. The book was published in 1978 by Clarkson Potter. Bartley was a graduate of Erhard Seminars Training and served on its advisory board. Erhard wrote a foreword to the book. The book's structure describes Erhard's education, transformation, reconnection with his family, and the theories of the est training.
The book went through five editions in its first year. Reviewers generally commented that the book was favorable to Erhard, and a number of critics felt that it was unduly so, or lacked objectivity, citing Bartley's close relationship to Erhard. Responses to the writing were mixed; while some reviewers found it well written and entertaining, others felt the tone was too slick, promotional, or hagiographic.
Background.
This biography tells Werner Erhard's early life story and the creation of the est Training which he designed to provide people with access to their own transformational experience.  
Werner Erhard (born John Paul Rosenberg), a California-based former salesman, training manager and executive in the encyclopedia business, created the Erhard Seminars Training ("est") course in 1971. est was a form of Large Group Awareness Training, and was part of the Human Potential Movement. est was a four-day, 60-hour self-help program given to groups of 250 people at a time. The program was very intensive. Participants were taught that they were responsible for their life outcomes.
est was widely ridiculed in the popular press and aroused a great deal of controversy.
In 1985, Werner Erhard and Associates repackaged the course as "The Forum", a seminar focused on "goal-oriented breakthroughs".
In the early 1990s Erhard faced family problems, as well as tax problems that were eventually resolved in his favor. In 1991 a group of his associates formed the company Landmark Education, purchasing The Forum's course "technology" from Erhard.
Author.
William Warren Bartley, III, professor of philosophy at California State University, Hayward from 1973, prior to writing his biography on Erhard, had authored "The Retreat to Commitment" (1962), on the epistemology of Sir Karl Popper; "Wittgenstein" (1973), a biography of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein; edited (1977) Lewis Carroll's "Symbolic Logic" of 1896; and authored a book titled "Morality and Religion" (1971). Bartley was first introduced to and referred to est in March 1972 by a doctor whom he had consulted about his nine-year struggle with insomnia. As a result of his experience in the est training his insomnia was cured. He then became very involved in the est organization, and served for several years as the company's philosophical consultant. He received payments of over US$30,000 in this capacity during the two years he spent writing the book.
He also served on the "Advisory Board" of est. Bartley interviewed a number of individuals who were involved in his subject's life and made use of quotations from a wide array of sources. Bartley commented on his subject in an article on the book in "The Evening Independent", stating: "He's not a huckster, although he's a great salesman. I think he's a very good man, a very important man. ... He's a fascinating man. People are interested in him."
Contents.
Life story
The book recounts how Erhard's childhood events, job positions and self-education led to the development of the est training. Born Jack Rosenberg, Erhard was an inquisitive child who was close to his mother. In his student years, he read profusely and earned superior grades. As a teenager, Erhard experienced both conflicts with his mother and a growing dissatisfaction with his life. Shortly after graduating from high school he married his girlfriend Pat Campbell, who had become pregnant. Instead of pursuing his plans for higher education, he took on a variety of jobs including meat-packing, heating and plumbing, estimating and selling cars. By the age of 21, Erhard had become the top car salesman at the dealership he worked for. By the time he was 25, Erhard and his wife had four children and he was feeling increasingly restless and constrained. He formed a friendship with a woman named June Bryde, which gradually deepened into an affair. He secretly arranged a flight from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with June in 1960, leaving behind his wife and their four children, who would not hear from him for twelve years. The couple settled for a time in St Louis, and it was at this time that he changed his name to Werner Erhard with June changing hers to Ellen Erhard. After more work in car sales, Erhard joined the sales staff of "Parents Magazine" and was rapidly promoted to training manager and eventually appointed vice-president in 1967. During this period Erhard moved frequently to different parts of the US as dictated by the demands of the job, finally settling in San Francisco. When "Parents Magazine" was sold to the Time-Life group, he was recruited by the Grolier Society as Divisional Manager. According to Grolier vice-president John Wirtz the intention of appointing Erhard was that he would bring "integrity, honesty and straightforwardness" to their sales practices.
Personal search and self-education
Shortly after moving to St. Louis Erhard began to embark on a program of inquiry and self-education. Initially he focused on self-improvement books such as "Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill and "Psycho-Cybernetics" by Maxwell Maltz. From there, he widened his search to Human Potential Movement psychologists such as Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers, a range of traditional Western philosophers, and Eastern disciplines such as Zen Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Subud and the Martial arts as well as contemporary movements including Mind Dynamics, and Scientology.
Creating the est training
Bartley recounts a revelation that Erhard said he had experienced in March 1971 while driving into San Francisco, California to work at Grolier Society. Erhard described to Bartley what the revelation experience felt like: "What happened had no form. It was timeless, unbounded, ineffable, beyond language." He told Bartley that he realized: "I had to 'clean up' my life. I had to acknowledge and correct the lies in my life. I saw that the lies that I told about others — my wanting my family, or Ellen (his second wife), or anyone else, to be different from the way that they are -- came from lies that I told about myself -- my wanting to be different from the way that I was." 
His desire to share this experience led to the plans formed later that year to create the est training. The first promotional seminar was held in September with over one thousand attendees, and the first est training took place in October 1971 in a San Francisco hotel.
In October 1972, while leading an est session in New York, Erhard realized that the time had come to reconnect with his family after an absence of 12 years. Although his long absence from his family caused them feelings of confusion and pain, he re-established cordial and loving relationships with all of them. His brother and sister became est Trainers and took on prominent roles in the business. He also set up a separate business venture for Ellen that gave her the financial freedom to choose how to structure her life and her relationship with him.
Key concepts of the est training as defined by Erhard and described in the book include:
Intersections
The biographical chapters on Erhard are interspersed with chapters that Bartley refers to as "Intersections". These chapters contain Bartley's scholarly overview and analysis of the various disciplines that Werner Erhard explored before founding the est training.
Reception.
The book was 8th place on the "Time" non-fiction bestseller list of November 20, 1978. Bartley told "The Evening Independent" in February 1979 that the book had sold a total of 110,000 copies and gone through five editions.
Jonathan Lieberson, writing for "The New York Review of Books", described the book as "attractively written, never shrill or unduly proselytizing, careful to avoid the hysteria and tribalism that usually characterize the early years of movements like est", but considered Bartley to have "fallen" for Erhard. Given Bartley's previous work, Lieberson stated, he might have made an ideal interpreter of Erhard, but he found this expectation "disappointed [although] the book is nevertheless instructive". A review of "Werner Erhard" in "Kirkus Reviews" similarly concluded, "Too entranced to be truly objective, Bartley is nonetheless an insightfully partial observer." "Booklist" stated that Bartley, as an est student, had made the "mistake of being too close to his subject to be objective or critical."
In "Psychology Today", Morris B. Parloff stated that Bartley had written his biography of Erhard "carefully, lovingly, and well". Kris Jeter, writing in "Cults and the Family", commented that "wise researchers know and teach that one should be in love with their research topic", and counted Bartley's book among several in which "this love was highly evident". Steve McNamarra, in the "Pacific Sun", said that the book was "clearly written and, while basically sympathetic" was not "an adulatory 'house job'." McNamarra found the sections detailing Erhard's "soap opera", making up three-quarters of the book, the easiest to read, while the "intersections", passages in which Bartley provided concise summaries of the philosophical traditions underpinning Erhard's est training, were tougher but ultimately rewarding.
Kenneth Wayne Thomas, in "Intrinsic Motivation at Work", described the book as "somewhat sympathetic" to Erhard and the est philosophy; Steve Jackson, writing in "Westword", similarly included it among "books sympathetic to Erhard, est and Landmark", written by an "old friend of Erhard's". Stephen Goldstein, in a "Washington Post" review, said Bartley had made it "obvious from the start that he cares about his subject and his own est experience" and had told "a rather simple, straightforward story that pretty much lets you draw your own conclusions [about Erhard] or keep the ones you have already reached." A reviewer in "" stated he was "enthusiastic about this book", praising the "personal quality [of] the narrative, which, though, sometimes becomes overly detailed." He highly recommended the book for general and college libraries focused on the social sciences.
Other commentators felt that the book was unduly favourable to Erhard. A review of the book in "The Christian Century" stated that Bartley had got "sucked into" writing a "promo on Erhard, founder of one of the pseudo-therapies of the '70s." The "Los Angeles Times" commented that "[Bartley's] philosophical justification of est as a mishmash of totalitarianism, hucksterism and existentialism makes this book more a public relations product than an objective study." A "Chicago Tribune" review described the book as a "painstaking ... act of devotion" that nevertheless failed in its mission: "No one reading it is likely to agree with Bartley that the founder of est is a philosopher and spiritual leader of Gandhian magnitude except the already convinced." James R. Fisher, in "Six Silent Killers: Management's Greatest Challenge", and Suzanne Snider, writing for "The Believer" magazine, referred to Bartley's book as a "hagiography", and Rachel Jones of "Noseweek" considered the book "sycophantic". A review in "The Evening Independent" described Bartley as Erhard's "friend and admitted booster", telling his "often-sordid story in detail." E. C. Dennis, writing for "Library Journal", found that Bartley's work "has a slick tone and more than a trace of hero worship". Dennis acknowledged that the book gave "the full details of Erhard's 'soap opera,' often in his own words," but was critical of Bartley's writing, saying he cast "a Freud's-eye-view on his subject's youthful failings, but after the famous 'transformation' his tone becomes almost reverential." Dennis stated that the book failed to ask important questions, but that large public libraries should carry a copy, given its status as an "authorized" biography.

Jose Collins

Charlotte Josephine Collins (23 May 1887 – 6 December 1958) was an English actress and singer known by her stage name, José Collins, who was celebrated for her performances in musical comedies, such as the long-running "The Maid of the Mountains", and early motion pictures.
Life and career.
Charlotte Josephine Collins was born in London 1887 to music hall performer and comedian Lottie Collins, who popularized the song "Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay!". Her mother later married her music coach, Stephen Patrick Cooney, and Collins took the name Charlotte Josephine Cooney.
Collins got her start as a child performer, and by the age of 17 she had appeared in both pantomime and music hall as a singer and actress. She made her West End debut in a principal role in "The Antelope" (1908). On Broadway, she appeared in "Vera Violetta" (1911), "The Merry Countess" (1912), (and sharing a duet with Al Jolson), "The Whirl of Society" (1912), among others. Her revue appearances included the Ziegfeld Follies (1913), and "The Passing Show" (1914). Collins recorded the song "Just You and I and the Moon", composed by Dave Stamper with lyrics by Gene Buck, from the Ziegfeld Follies (1913). She also starred in "The Happy Day" in London and "Alone at Last" on Broadway (both in 1916).
Collins played the title role of Teresa, the gypsy bandit maid, in the hit musical "The Maid of the Mountains" (1917) to great acclaim, and as a result became known by the nickname of "Maid of the Mountains". The musical ran for 1,352 performances. In that show, she introduced the songs "Love Will Find a Way" and "A Paradise For Two." Collins played throughout the long run of this show and in many revivals over the years.
Collins later appeared in "Our Peg" (1919), "A Southern Maid" (1920), "Sybil" (1921), "The Last Waltz" (1922), "Catherine" (1923), "Our Nell" (1924) and "Frasquita" (1925). She spent the remainder of her career in revues, variety and non-musical roles, as well as in films. In her film career, she starred as Bessie, the vengeful model, in "The Light That Failed", (1916, based on Rudyard Kipling's poem), and she appeared in "The Imposter" (1915), "A Woman's Honor" (1916), and "The Sword of Damocles" (1920), among others. Her only musical film was "Facing the Music" (1933).
Jose Collins was married three times: firstly, in 1911, to Leslie Chatfield; secondly in 1920 to Lord Robert Edward Innes-Ker (brother of Henry John Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe); and lastly to Dr Gerald Kirkland. Collins had no children by any of her marriages; her second marriage ended in divorce in 1935.
She is commemorated by a blue plaque at Loughton. When erected, the plaque was on the actual house in which she lived towards the end of her life. This was demolished, and replaced by a block of flats called Collins Court.

Gley Lancer

 is a 1992 scrolling shooter video game originally developed by NCS Corporation, published in Japan by Masaya and in South Korea by Samsung for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. It was re-released in 2019 by Japanese publisher Columbus Circle. It follows Lucia Cabrock, daughter of Earth Federation Navy admiral Ken, who disappeared while fighting in a war between humans and an unknown alien race that possess the ability to teleport, joined by her friend Teim on a journey to save her father by stealing a starfighter. Controlling the titular fighter ship, the player must fight waves of enemies and bosses, while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. The Gley Lancer ship is equipped with two satellites options, whose positions and formations are determined by the player.
"Gley Lancer" was produced by Toshiro Tsuchida, who left Masaya in 1993 to found G-Craft, a company known for creating the "Front Mission" and "Arc the Lad" franchises. Noriyuki Iwadare, best known for his work on the "Langrisser", "Lunar", and "Grandia" franchises, was involved in the soundtrack as one of four composers under the music production company Cube. The game garnered mixed reception from critics upon release, most of which reviewed it as an import title. The original Mega Drive version was re-released through download services for other platforms. A port was also released in 2021 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. The Switch port received generally favorable response from reviewers.
Gameplay.
"Gley Lancer" is a scrolling shooter game. The plot revolves around Lucia Cabrock, daughter of Earth Federation Navy admiral Ken, who disappeared while fighting in a war between humans and an unknown alien race that possess the ability to teleport. Upon hearing about the disappearance of her father, Lucia is joined by her friend Teim and steals the titular starfighter to save him. The player takes control of the Gley Lancer space fighter craft through nine stages over a constantly scrolling background, populated with an assortment of enemies and obstacles, and the scenery never stops moving until a boss is reached, which must be fought in order to progress further.
A key gameplay mechanic to "Gley Lancer" are satellite options called "Gunners", which are activated by shooting silver and blue pods in order to pick up various types of weapons. The player can have up to two Gunners and both will always have the same weapon, with subsequent power-ups overwriting them both. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses one of seven formations to use for the Movers that the Gunners are mounted on. During gameplay, the Gley Lancer can toggle through four different speeds in a "1-2-3-4-3-2-repeat" order, although the starting point can be chosen in the options menu.
Development and release.
"Gley Lancer" was developed by NCS Corporation, a Japanese computer software developer founded in 1980 by Masaya Fujita, which entered the video game industry in 1985 under the brand Masaya. They are best known for series such as "Assault Suit", "Langrisser", "Kaizō Chōjin Shubibinman", and "Cho Aniki". It was produced by Toshiro Tsuchida, who created the "Front Mission" and "Arc the Lad" franchises at G-Craft, a company he founded in 1993 after leaving Masaya. Hikaru Satō acted as planner, with Yukihiro Higuchi serving as main programmer, while Hiroshi Aizawa was responsible for the character illustrations. Noriyuki Iwadare, best known for his work on the "Langrisser", "Lunar", and "Grandia" franchises, was involved in the soundtrack as one of four composers under the music production company Cube. Several staff members within NCS also collaborated in the game's development process.
"Gley Lancer" was first published for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in Japan by Masaya on July 17, 1992. It was also published in South Korea by Samsung. The game's title is engrish, which was common of many shooting games of that era. The "r" from "grey" was substituted with "l" resulting in the game's title. In 2006, an unofficial English fan translation was released by the group M.I.J.E.T. The game was re-released internationally for the Wii's Virtual Console; first in Japan on February 26, 2008, then in Europe on May 16, and later in North America on July 21. It was also re-released in digital form for Microsoft Windows through D4 Enterprise's Project EGG service. In 2019, the original Mega Drive version was re-released by Columbus Circle on June 6 as a limited run of 2500 copies, featuring a new cover art illustrated by Hiroshi Aizawa.
"Gley Lancer" received a port for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S by Ratalaika Games on October 6, 2021, featuring save states and rewind functions, the ability to switch between satellite types and aim them via an analogue stick, and translated text. In 2022, Columbus Circle released a "30th annyversary" edition for the Mega Drive on October 28, bundled with a CD album containing arranged songs by two of the game's composers. That same year, publisher Retro-Bit also announced a release of the game for Genesis outside Japan. It was released in 2023 and used an uncredited 2006 fan translation by MIJET.
Reception.
"Gley Lancer" garnered mixed reception from critics upon release, most of which reviewed it as an import title. "Mega Drive Advanced Gaming"s John Davison praised the graphics, use of sound samples, and large levels, but noted that the game was occasionally frustrating and expressed disappointment for the lack of an official release outside Japan. "MegaTech"s Thomas Guise and Paul Glancey highlighted the game's presentation for its story introduction and cutscenes. While they found the sound aspect to be okay, both Guise and Glancey criticized the uninteresting sprites and overall longevity, recommending "Thunder Force IV" and "Twinkle Tale" instead. "Sega Force"s Mat Yeo and Adrian Pitt concurred with Davison, Guise, and Glancey about the presentation and difficulty. However, both Yeo and Pitt disagreed with Guise and Glancey in regards to the game's visuals, giving positive remarks to its colorful bosses and detailed sprites, while also commending the audio.
"Sega Pro"s James Scullion lauded the game's visuals for its fast scrolling and introduction sequence, soundtrack, voice samples, gameplay options, controls, and difficulty, but criticized the bosses for being easy. In contrast to the other reviewers, "Mean Machines Sega"s Julian Rignall and Radion Automatic commended the presentation and controls, but were critical of the "poor" sprites and graphical effects as well as backgrounds for their inconsistent quality. Both Rignall and Atomatic also criticized the game's sound, unoriginal gameplay, and overall duration. "Mega"s Andy Dyer gave positive remarks to the visuals, but felt mixed regarding its length and gameplay, while criticizing the audio. Nevertheless, Dyer found it to be a decent shooter. "Sega Power"s Dean Mortlock shared similar thoughts as Davison and Scullion, regarding the title to be a fairly standard but fun shoot 'em up. Readers of the Japanese "Sega Saturn Magazine" voted to give "Gley Lancer" a 7.4341 out of 10 score, ranking among Mega Drive games at the number 215 spot in a 1995 public poll.
Reviews of the game's Virtual Console re-release on Wii were mostly positive. "Nintendo Life"s Damien McFerran found the game to be graphically impressive due to its anime-style introduction reminiscent of a Sega Mega-CD title, detailed sprites and parallax scrolling, while noting the wide array of gameplay options for the player. In contrast, "Eurogamer"s Dan Whitehead stated that "there's not much here to distinguish it from the multitude of similar shooters already available cheaper on the VC." "IGN"s Lucas M. Thomas commended its presentation, visuals, audio, gameplay, and overall lasting appeal. In a retrospective coverage, "Hardcore Gaming 101"s Kurt Kalata wrote that "While the level design lacks polish, the ability to aim your weapons really opens up new doors for shooter gameplay – after playing "Gleylancer", every other game seems so strict, with just the ability to shoot in pre-determined directions. That’s the trademark of an excellent game, and "Gleylancer" sits nicely next to "Thunder Force IV" and "MUSHA" as one of the best shooters on the Mega Drive."
The Nintendo Switch port of "Gley Lancer" received "generally favorable reviews", according to review aggregator Metacritic. Kerry Brunskill of "Nintendo Life" lauded the number of options for flexibility but saw the inability to play the original version without the English translation to be a negative aspect of the port. "TouchArcade"s Shaun Musgrave commended the release for its number of features, emulation quality, and minimal input lag, stating "Whether you want to experience a heretofore hard-to-obtain classic or just like quality shoot-em-ups, "Gleylancer" is an excellent choice." "Push Square"s Jamie O'Neill also gave the PlayStation 5 version an overall positive outlook.

Airwork Flight 23

Airwork Flight 23 was a New Zealand Post cargo flight between Auckland International Airport (AKL/NZAA) and Woodbourne Airport (BHE/NZWB) that disintegrated on May 3, 2005.
History.
In command of the flight was 43-year-old Captain Clive Adamson, a relatively experienced pilot and line check captain with 6,500 total hours, nearly half of them on the Metroliner. Joining him was less experienced first officer, 41-year-old Anthony Drummond, who had 2,300 flying hours but only 70 on the Metroliner, which he had started flying earlier that year. No one else was on board, nor was there room, since the entire cabin was full of palletized mail.
The aircraft was scheduled for take off at 9:00 P.M. local time, but it was delayed while cargo was being loaded. During the delay the pilots ordered an extra of fuel and told the person refueling to put all the fuel in the left wing fuel tank, instead of splitting the fuel exactly between the two tanks, as was company procedure. The flight eventually took off at 9:36 P.M. local time.
Immediately after take off the autopilot was engaged and it controlled the aircraft during its climb to flight level 220 (approximately . The flight was continued at full power instead of cruise setting to make up for lost time for the next fifteen minutes. On powering down to cruise power, the captain noticed imbalance between the fuel tanks and initiated cross flow procedures. Shortly after, at 10:13 P.M. local time, the plane entered a spiral descent and broke up, killing both pilots.
Investigation.
The accident was investigated by the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC). It found that when the captain noted the fuel imbalance, he said, "We'll just open the cross flow again ... sit on left ball and trim it accordingly." He repeated the instruction five times in the next 19 seconds, to which the co-pilot replied, "I was being a bit cautious". The captain said, "Don't be cautious mate, it'll do it good".
This resulted in the plane being flown at a large sideslip angle while still under autopilot control, by means of the rudder trim mechanism. Forty-seven seconds after the cross flow was opened, the captain said, "Doesn't like that one mate ... you'd better grab it." One second later they received a "bank angle" warning, followed by a warning chime that was presumably a warning they were straying from their correct altitude.
The investigation came to the conclusion that this was due to the autopilot disengaging, probably due to a servo reaching its torque limit. This meant that there was no compensation applied for the rudder trim input, and the plane entered a roll and steep descent, disintegrating around flight level 199. The investigation found poor visibility at night in low cloud was a factor in preventing the pilots realizing sooner.
Aftermath.
The following improvements were implemented as a result:

Department for Infrastructure (Northern Ireland)

The Department for Infrastructure (DfI, ; ) is a devolved Northern Ireland government department in the Northern Ireland Executive.
Up until May 2016, the department was called the Department for Regional Development.
Aim.
DfI's overall aim is to "improve quality of life by securing transport and water infrastructure and shaping the region's long-term strategic development".
Responsibilities.
The department's main responsibilities include

History.
The Ministry of Home Affairs was established on the formation of Northern Ireland in June 1921 and was responsible for a range of non-economic domestic matters, including local government. A separate Ministry of Health and Local Government was formed in 1944 and was subsequently split in 1965, to create the Ministry of Development. An environment ministry existed in the 1974 Northern Ireland Executive and the ministry was known as the Department of the Environment under direct rule.
The DoE is still a phrase used in everyday language in Northern Ireland to describe the Roads Service, which was once run by the department but is currently an agency of the Department for Infrastructure.
Following a referendum on the Belfast Agreement on 23 May 1998 and the granting of royal assent to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 on 19 November 1998, a Northern Ireland Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive were established by the United Kingdom Government under Prime Minister Tony Blair. The process was known as devolution and was set up to return devolved legislative powers to Northern Ireland. DRD was one of five new devolved Northern Ireland departments created in December 1999 by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and The Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999.
A devolved minister first took office on 2 December 1999. Devolution was suspended for six periods, during which the department came under the responsibility of direct rule ministers from the Northern Ireland Office:
Ministers for Infrastructure.
Direct rule ministers.
During the periods of suspension, the following ministers of the Northern Ireland Office were responsible for the department:

Corruption in the Suvarnabhumi Airport project

Allegations of corruption during the development of Suvarnabhumi Airport, the newest international airport serving Bangkok, Thailand, have been made since the project's inception. These allegations started in the 1970s, when land for the airport was purchased during the dictatorship of Thanom Kittikachorn, and extended to the government of Thaksin Shinawatra, during which most of the construction occurred. 
"The Nation", a Thai English-language daily, published several reports alleging corruption in the purchase of x-ray baggage scanning devices for the airport. The resulting scandal delayed the opening of the airport by a year and allowed the opposition Democrat Party to initiate a 20-hour no-confidence censure debate that forced Thaksin to remove close supporter Suriya Jungrungreangkit from his position of Transport Minister. The Royal Thai Army swept into power in a military coup in 2006, using the allegedly shoddy construction of the airport as one of the justifications for its coup. The junta initiated several investigations into the airport. The investigative panels found that damage to the airport was "minute" and "common." The cost of fixing the damage was estimated at less than 1% of the total airport cost. The junta was accused of delaying airport repairs and intensifying the airport's problems in order to pin further blame on the deposed government.
In 2008, "The Nation" admitted that its reports of corruption were incorrect, and retracted their stories.
The Council for National Security (CNS) in Thailand established the Assets Examination Committee (AEC) in 2006 to investigate actions that caused damage to the state from operations or projects by individuals in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The AEC initially took on eight cases for examination, but later added an additional five cases, for a total of 13 cases that were investigated. One of these cases involved the procurement of CTX explosive detection machines for Suvarnabhumi Airport, and the AEC decided to take legal action against 25 individuals, including Thaksin Shinawatra and other politicians, state officials, and business people, for their involvement in a rigged auction involving the organizers and participants of the auction. The AEC also accused these individuals of abuse of position, corruption, and neglecting their duties or acting dishonestly, causing harm. After completing the investigation, the AEC submitted the indictment to the Attorney General's Office in 2011, but the case was referred to the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) due to objections from the Attorney General's Office about the incompleteness of the case. The joint committee between the Attorney General and NACC has been unable to reach a decision on the case for several years.
Overview.
Charges of corruption were levelled against Thai governments since the airport project's inception in the 1970s. "All the recent previous governments before Thaksin took part in taking something from the project," noted Chaiwat Sinsuwong, a member of the Council of Engineers.
Mr Weera Somkuamkit, of the People's Network on Corruption has noted that "Someone got a big payoff just by laying down the sand. There's corruption in every airport project such as the car park, bidding on duty-free shops, cooling system for the buildings and power generating system." Weera Somkuamkit has not yet made public any evidence supporting his claims. Based on this and other allegations, the opposition parties during the Thaksin government initiated a vote of no confidence against the Thaksin-government's transport minister. The censure motion was not successful.
After the coup, the Council for National Security (CNS) called on relevant officials to discuss the issue of corruption, including Kranarong Jantik, former secretary-general of the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC), and Jaruvan Maintaka, Auditor General of the State Audit Office of the Kingdom of Thailand (SAO), to prepare for the establishment of an organization to check for corruption in the government of Thaksin Shinawatra. On September 30, 2006, the Council for National Security announced the appointment of the Assets Examination Committee (AEC) to investigate actions that cause damage to the state from operations or projects by individuals in the Cabinet of the Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. 
The process of the AEC begins with the submission of already-investigated and data-gathered cases by the State Audit Office of the Kingdom of Thailand. Initially, the AEC takes on a total of 8 cases for examination, with an additional 5 cases added later, for a total of 13 cases that the AEC investigates. One of them has a CTX explosive detection machine procurement project for Suvarnabhumi Airport included, and the Assets Examination Committee has decided to take legal action against the political figures, including Thaksin Shinawatra, as the Chairman of the Suvarnabhumi Airport Development Committee (ADC), and other politicians, including Suriya Juangroongruangkit, ex-Minister of Transport, as well as state officials and employees, board members and executives of the New Bangkok International Airport Company Limited (NBIA) and Thai Airports Company Limited (TAC), such as Sisuk Jantharangsi, the Minister of Transport, Chaikasem Nitisiri, the attorney general, ITO Trading Group as a legal entity and business people, a total of 25 people.
The AEC has issued a resolution to pursue a case against these individuals in relation to a rigged auction involving the organizers and participants of the auction, resulting in unfair competition (violation of the State Enterprise Act B.E. 2542, sections 5, 11, 12, 13).
The case also involves abuse of position and corruption by the perpetrators and accomplices in several counts (Criminal Code, sections 83, 86, 90, 91, 144, 149, 152, 157, 341).
Additionally, as government employees, these people are also accused of neglecting their duties or acted dishonestly, causing harm (Public Sector Employee Discipline Act of 1959, sections 3, 9, 11). The commission has also requested that the accused return or compensate for damages in the amount of 6.937 million baht.
This investigation differs from the previous investigation led by the Inspection Committee, headed by Thaksin Shinawatra, which concluded that "no irregularities were found".
After the investigation was completed, the AEC made the decision to pursue legal action and submitted the indictment to the Attorney General's Office on May 28, 2011, one month before the AEC term ended. However, at the time, the Attorney General, Chaiyakasem Nitisiri, himself was facing his own charges in the CTX case and the AEC was forced to separate Chaiyakasem's case and file the lawsuit themselves.
On June 27, 2011, just three days before the AEC's term ended, they had already made the decision to pursue legal action against the perpetrators and submitted the indictment to the Attorney General's Office. However, the Attorney General's Office raised objections to the incompleteness of the case and requested that the AEC form a committee to review the incomplete aspects of the case. The AEC was unable to comply with this request as their term was ending in just a few days. Because of this, the investigation had been referred to National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) for further action by default. Mr. Kranarong Jantik, being a member of NACC as well, had recused himself from this investigation because he was a former member of AEC, which is considered to have a stake in the matter.
The joint committee between the Attorney General and NACC has been deadlocked and unable to reach a decision on this case for more than three years. Finally, in September 2011, the Attorney General ruled to dismiss the case, citing insufficient evidence as the reason. In response, the NACC prepared to file a lawsuit on its own and appointed a prosecutor from the Lawyers Council Under the Royal Patronage to handle the case.
In preparing to file a lawsuit on its own, the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) has had to summarize the new allegations and gather additional evidence. In this effort, the NACC has sought cooperation from the US Department of Justice to provide additional documentation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), totaling more than 5,000 pages. A key piece of evidence is a confirmation from the US Department of Justice, sent in early August 2012, stating that no evidence was found of payment or receipt of any benefits from the sale of CTX explosives detection equipment. Finally, on August 28, 2012, Wichai Wiwitsevi, a member of the National Counter Corruption Commission (NCCC), announced officially that the NCCC had resolved to refer the case involving the procurement and installation of CTX explosives detection equipment and the construction of baggage handling systems at Suvarnabhumi Airport to the Office of the Attorney General for prosecution.
Car park.
The airport contains 2 5-storey car park buildings with a combined capacity of 5,000 cars.
Two videos were released in which car park contractor Latthapol Kesakotin, in one video, claimed that he paid US$250 million to Yaowaret Shinawatra (the Prime Minister's sister) to gain a contract to build and operate the airport car park, and another video in which he claimed he didn't pay anything to Yaowaret. He later publicly denied that he paid anything to Yaowaret.
Bomb detectors.
Twenty-six CTX 9000 DSi explosive detection x-ray baggage scanning devices were purchased from GE Invision with a total contract value of US$65 million. In response to concerns from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) that the 26 devices would not be sufficient, the equipment specifications were revised and another 20 devices were acquired. The new specifications also required modification of several other elements of the airport. The CTX 9000 model was selected by the airport primary contractor's design consultant, Cage Inc. The choice was also endorsed by New Bangkok International Airport's independent adviser, Quatrotec Inc.
"The Nation" published reports claiming corruption in the purchase of the CTX bomb scanners. Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the opposition Democrat Party, initiated an unsuccessful censure debate against Transport Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit. The opposition alleged that in November 2004, Suriya had known that Invision was under investigation by the US Department of Justice, and therefore would not be able to provide the bomb scanners on schedule, and despite this knowledge, had approved of payments for the bomb scanners to the airport contractor (the ITO joint venture) and bomb-scanner sub-contractor, Patriot Business Consultants. The opposition claimed that one billion baht (US$25 million) could have been saved if the bomb scanners were purchased directly from GE InVision rather than going through the two local contractors. The opposition did not win the censure motion, and subsequent investigations cleared Suriya Jungrungreangkit of any wrongdoing. The scandal delayed the opening of Suvarnabhumi Airport by over a year.
In 2008, "The Nation" admitted that its reports of corruption were incorrect.
Suvarnabhumi City.
In October 2005, the government of Thaksin Shinawatra floated a proposal to combine several districts around Suvarnabhumi Airport into a new province, to be managed as a special administrative zone. These districts would include Samut Prakan's Bang Sao Thong sub-district and Bang Phli district as well as Lat Krabang and Prawet districts of Bangkok. The new province would allow speedier large scale investments in infrastructure by enabling the government to bypass administrative and budgetary constraints for the estimated THB500 billion (US$12.5 billion) in public and private sector. The new zone, to be known as "Nakhon Suvarnabhumi" (Suvarnabhumi City) would cover 521 square kilometres (roughly the size of Singapore) with a population of about 462,000 people. In 2006 the cabinet approved in principle a draft Nakhon Suvarnabhumi Bill prepared by the interior ministry. The Council of State will then review it, followed by a series of public hearings, before the bill is submitted to the House of Representatives.
There were anonymous allegations that the proposed establishment of the new zone would cause property values to increase, and that government politicians had bought large plots of land in speculation. However, the opening of the airport caused property prices to fall 40-50% in an estimated 4,000 rai of land surrounding the airport from 2005 to 2006 due to increased noise levels. An anonymous source had earlier informed "The Nation" newspaper that "My friend told me that a politician's wife had bought 4,000 rai from a developer...The transaction was wrapped up in the first quarter of this year [2006]". The source also noted that prominent developers like Land &amp; Houses, Quality Houses, Property Perfect, Supalai, LPN Development, SC Asset Corp, as well as the Jungrungreangkit and Mahagitsiri families owned large tranches in the proposed zone. Several developers denied that their ownership of land was related in any way to the proposal and noted that the properties were bought years before.
The plans for Suvarnabhumi City were largely scrapped by post-coup Finance Minister Pridiyathorn Devakula.
Post-coup Investigations.
Purging of management.
The Royal Thai Army overthrew the Thaksin government in September 2006, using the allegedly shoddy construction of the airport as one of the justifications for its coup.
After the coup, numerous public accusations were made that construction standards of the airport were sub-standard and that cracks were appearing in the runway. Junta leader Saprang Kalayanamitr forced AOT President Chotisak Asapaviriya to resign and also dismissed the directors of Suvarnabhumi Airport and AOT Commercial Operations.
Junta-led investigations.
A junta-appointed panel of engineers assigned to inspect the airport noted that damage to the airport was "minute," and "common." This was contrary to public accusations that the airport was seriously damaged after only four months of operation. A spokesman for British Airways also said that "everything is normal," and that "We haven't heard any complaints from the staff." A two-week investigation led by Tortrakul Yomnak, a chief engineer for AOT, found that the runway was safe, and that cracks could be repaired in as little as a few hours. At the beginning of the investigation, Tortrakul had warned that the airport might need to be closed for three years.
AOT-led investigations.
The Assistant Secretary-General of the junta was appointed Chairman of the Board at Airports of Thailand. He initiated a comprehensive study of problems at the airport. The completed study showed that the cost of fixing 60 identified problems at the airport would be less than 1% of the total airport cost and that the problems could be fixed in four to five years. Dr. Narupol Chaiyut, a member of a committee overseeing service problems at the new airport, estimated that 70% of the problems would be fixed in 2007.
Engineering Institute of Thailand investigations.
The Engineering Institute of Thailand (EIT) conducted investigations at the airport in late 2006 after signs of distress were spotted at several locations in Suvarnabhumi's taxiways and taxi lanes. Rutting was found in five of the six taxi lanes and one of the six taxiways. Plastic deformation of the asphalt wearing course was observed near the takeoff position of the runway. However, the investigators noted that plastic deformation at this location was a common phenomenon and only routine maintenance was required to repair the distress. Aside from this surface distortion, both runways were in good structural condition.
Further investigations found that taxi lane and taxiway rutting was caused by separation of the asphalt binder from the aggregate surface due to prolonged water infiltration into the asphalt concrete base course, a phenomenon known as "stripping." The 23 cm thick base course is the top-most layer of the tarmac. Core samples indicated that the concrete base course material contained the correct job mix and aggregate gradation. Below the base course are the binder course, and the cement-treated base.
Detailed investigations found that water seepage was evident along the rims of the expansion joints in the cement-tested base, indicating that a large quantity of water was still trapped in the sand blanket (the bottom-most layer of the tarmac). It was found that water trapped in the sand blanket was fully confined with no connection to the pavement areas of the airport. A later investigation by the AOT identified several potential reasons for the trapped water in the sand blanket. The AOT's findings were disputed by several experts.
The EIT sent a formal warning to AOT in November 2006 about the urgent need to drain water from beneath the tarmac, and the need for immediate action. "The AOT did nothing about the problem," Suebsak Promboon of the EIT noted. "The situation might not have become this bad if the water had been drained then".
In a public statement on 15 February 2007, the EIT again strongly recommended that trapped water should be drained out urgently to minimise the potential spread of cracks. Karun Chandrarangsu, president of EIT, noted, "Suvarnabhumi is like a patient in a coma who continues to suffer from severe bleeding. Stopping the blood flow now is more urgent and important than debating what caused the injury."
Repairs and further criticisms.
Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont and AOT Chairman General Saprang Kalayanamitr refused to authorize repairs on the airport tarmac. Suebsak Promboon, a senior foundation engineer and a member of the Tortrakul Yomnak-led airport tarmac inspection panel, accused the AOT of refusing to take action to solve the problems at the airport.
Critics noted that junta-led investigations were unlikely to reveal an impartial picture of the airport's shortcomings. "Problems are normal for any new airport. In our case it's made more complex because everybody wants to run down the former prime minister", noted Sumet Jumsai, a leading Thai architect. Leading engineers were sharply divided over the root causes of problems faced by the new airport.
There was a conflict of interest in the investigation because the attorney general responsible for prosecuting the case was also one of the board member of Airports of Thailand Public Company Limited (AOT) who was being prosecuted. The individuals in question are Chaiyasit Nititharaj, and in the end, he ruled not to prosecute Thaksin Shinawatra. After the decision not to prosecute the aforementioned case, Chaiyasit Nititharaj received the position of Minister of Justice and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and advisor to the Center for Maintaining Peace and Order in the Yingluck Shinawatra government.

Headley Britannia

Headley Britannia, (January 24, 1993 - April 1, 2014) stable name "Brit", was a mare who competed at the highest levels of the equestrian sport of eventing. Relatively small for the sport, her jumping ability, manoeuvrability and willingness propelled her to the top of the sport.
Headley Britannia was by one of the top eventing stallions in Britain, Jumbo, who first competed at the Advanced level with Andrew Nicholson as a seven-year-old. The stallion has been a top producer of eventers, dressage horses (his get have reached Prix St. George), and Grade A show jumpers.
Headley Britannia's greatest accomplishments include a win at the 2006 Burghley Horse Trials, the first mare in 33 years to do so, a win at the 2007 Badminton Horse Trials, the first mare in 53 years, and a win at the 2009 Rolex Kentucky Three Day. She came third at the 2006 Luhmuhlen Three Day Event, a great accomplishment after having taken a fall the previous year on cross-country and then contracting a virus which nearly killed her. She was an alternative to the 2006 World Equestrian Games, but when not called, was switched to the Burghley Horse Trials. She is one of only two horses in history to have won all three of the top four-star events (Badminton, Burghley, and Rolex), and has had a Breyer model made of her.
In 2007 her owners Katinka and Neil Thorburn gave her to her rider, Lucinda Fredericks. After winning Badminton she went to stud for embryo transfer. Both foals were by stallion Jaguar Mail and carried by surrogate mares.
The first of Brit's two foals was born in April 2008, a chestnut filly with a white star. Fredericks later confirmed that the second foal had been born in May 2008 this one being a dark bay colt. Strangely the foals resemble much like their parents, the filly, Little Britannia, is chestnut with a white star like her dam, and the colt, Britannia's Mail looking remarkably similar to his sire Jaguar Mail, dark bay in colour. Both foals are now part of Team Fredericks Foal syndicate which people can buy shares for Britannia's Mail is also available for stallion services 
On March 15, 2012, it was announced by Team Fredericks that Headley Britannia would retire officially at Badminton Horse Trials. Due to the cancellation of Badminton in 2012 Badminton have agreed to hold this at the 2013 event instead.
Always small compared to the competition, her competitive spirit, manoeuvrability, sheer guts and a Will To Win have propelled her to the top. The plan is to enjoy competing her at a much lower level, breed more foals by Embryo Transfer and eventually hand the reins over to 8 year old Ellie who is champing at the bit to take the ride on. "It has been wonderful that Brit has been able to end her eventing career on a high at top level in a fit, sound and healthy state," she added.
Headley Britannia was euthanized at age 21 on 1 April 2014.

Sylvain Simard

Sylvain Simard (born 26 April 1945) is a politician and academic based in the Canadian province of Quebec. He represented Richelieu in the National Assembly of Quebec from 1994 to 2012, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Lucien Bouchard and Bernard Landry. Simard is a member of the Parti Québécois (PQ).
Early life and career.
Simard was born in Chicoutimi, Quebec. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Education from the Université de Montréal (1967), a Master of Arts degree from McGill University (1970), and a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from the University of Bordeaux in France (1975). From 1976 to 1994, he was a professor of French literature at the University of Ottawa. He completed a work entitled "Mythe et reflet de la France: L'image du Canada en France" in 1987, examining perceptions of Quebec in France from the time of Louis Napoleon to World War I.
Simard's brother, Christian Simard, was a Bloc Québécois member of the House of Commons of Canada from 2004 to 2006.
PQ vice-president.
Simard first became involved with the Parti Québécois as a regional organizer in the Outaouais. He was elected as the PQ's vice-president in 1981 and argued that the party's internal organization should receive more autonomy from the provincial PQ government of René Lévesque.
In 1982, he helped organize a street protest against Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau's patriation of the Canadian Constitution without Quebec's approval. Later in the same year, he requested that Elections Canada incorporate a federal wing of the PQ so that the party could run candidates in the next Canadian federal election. Some senior party members opposed this measure, which led to the creation of the Parti nationaliste du Québec. Simard also helped coordinate the PQ's bid to join the Socialist International in 1983. This was opposed by the New Democratic Party, then the leading social democratic party in the rest of Canada outside Quebec.
Simard supported electoral reform and proposed that future elections in Quebec be conducted under a system of compensatory proportional representation. He also encouraged Premier Levesque to shuffle his cabinet and staff in early 1984, arguing that some people had been in the same positions for too long. His own term as vice-president ended in 1984.
Political activist.
Simard was encouraged to run as a New Democratic Party candidate in the 1988 federal election, at a time when the NDP was seeking to build its support base in Quebec. He ultimately decided against running.
In the same period, Simard became involved with local politics in the Outaouais region. He was a prominent local member of the "Société nationale des Québécois" and opposed proposed changes to the province's Charter of the French Language. He also formed a group called the Gatineau Democratic Movement in 1987, and there was some speculation that he would run for mayor in that year's municipal election. He ultimately decided against doing so, arguing that it would be irresponsible to split the vote against incumbent Gaétan Cousineau.
Cousineau was narrowly re-elected to the mayoralty, but resigned from office in early 1988. Simard was the first declared candidate in a by-election to succeed him, running on a platform of increased democratic consultation, budget cuts that would not affect municipal salaries, and reduced taxes. He also argued that Gatineau residents should be allowed to have a referendum on a proposed cultural centre, called for all mayoral candidates to declare their financial interests, and proposed a new municipal code of ethics. On election day, he lost to Bob Labine by only 174 votes.
Simard was a PQ candidate in the 1989 provincial election, narrowly losing to Liberal Party cabinet minister Guy Rivard in the Montreal division of Rosemont.
From 1990 to 1994, Simard was president of the Mouvement National des Quebecois (MNQ). In 1991, he argued that a sovereign Quebec would try to reduce the concentration of immigrant communities in Montreal neighbourhoods. He was quoted as saying, "We can't lower the concentration [of existing communities]; the people who are here are here. But in the future . . . we will have to adjust our welcome of immigrants to our capacities to integrate them." He also argued that francophone Quebecers would need to become more accepting of immigrants and the changes they would bring to Quebec culture. At a MNQ meeting in May 1991, he said that most francophone Quebecers were "remarkably open to the necessity for and the advantages of immigration."
As MNQ president, Simard argued that francophone Quebecers were unfairly singled out by Canadian federalists for having condoned racist and xenophobic behaviour in earlier times. In the wake of a public controversy over Esther Delisle's "The Traitor and the Jew", which addressed historical anti-Semitism and Quebec nationalism, Simard said, "Of course we denounce all forms of anti-Semitism and xenophobia, and we don't excuse it even fifty years later. But why should we have to respond to [...] attacks that are obviously politically motivated?" Unlike other Quebec sovereigntist groups, the MNQ under Simard's leadership sought to build links with francophone groups across Canada.
Simard called for a referendum on sovereignty in early 1992 and campaigned against the Charlottetown Accord on Canadian constitutional reform later in the same year.
Legislator.
Minister of International Relations.
Simard was first elected to the National Assembly of Quebec for Richelieu in the 1994 provincial election, defeating Liberal incumbent Albert Khelfa. The PQ won a majority government in this election under Jacques Parizeau's leadership, and Simard entered the legislature as a government backbencher. When Lucien Bouchard succeeded Parizeau as premier of Quebec on 29 January 1996, he appointed Simard as minister of international relations and minister responsible for La Francophonie, with further responsibilities for the Outaouais region. On 22 January 1997, Simard was given additional responsibilities as minister responsible for international humanitarian action.
Soon after his appointment, Simard warned the Canadian government to consider the possibility of a violent reaction if it ever tried to partition the predominantly federalist areas from a future, sovereign Quebec. This was in response to a statement by Canadian intergovernmental affairs minister Stéphane Dion, who said that if Canada was divisible, then Quebec would be as well.
In March 1996, Simard announced that Quebec would close thirteen of its nineteen foreign delegations as a cost-saving measure. He added that Quebec representatives in some of the affected areas could operate from within Canadian embassies, promoting both Quebec trade interests and sovereignty. Canadian deputy prime minister Sheila Copps responded that Quebec representatives would "absolutely not" be allowed to promote Quebec sovereignty in Canadian facilities, and Simard's plan was widely criticized in the rest of Canada.
Simard took part in a bid for Quebec to receive special status at the United Nations in 1997. This was defeated by the Canadian government. Later in the same year, he quarreled with federal politicians over the terms of a child-support agreement between Quebec and France; the Canadian government argued that some sections of the deal came close to defining Quebec as a sovereign country. Simard also threatened a boycott of the 2001 Francophone Games in Ottawa and Hull, on the grounds that the federal government was excluding Quebec from the organizing committee.
As minister of international relations, Simard represented Quebec in trade and diplomatic missions to France, China, Vietnam, Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and Zimbabwe. He was skeptical of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment and encouraged Canada to withdraw from negotiations around the accord in October 1998.
In late November 1996, Simard criticized Charles Aznavour after the well-known troubadour sang some of his best-known songs in English during a concert in Ottawa. The minister was quoted as saying, "Charles Aznavour is a French singer and when he comes here he should sing in French. It shows a complete ignorance of the reality and sensibilities of Quebec society — it's a provocation."
Simard was re-elected in the 1998 Quebec election, but was dropped from cabinet on 15 December 1998. In 2000, he co-authored a procedural review document recommending that elected representatives be given more opportunities to consider and scrutinize proposed legislation.
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
Simard rejoined Lucien Bouchard's cabinet on 6 October 2000, as the minister of citizenship and immigration. Soon after his appointment, he announced that Quebec would increase its annual immigration rate from 30,000 to a figure between 40,000 and 45,000 by 2003, while also raising its rate of francophone immigration from 44% to 52%. Echoing his statements from a decade earlier, he called for an increased settlement of immigrants into areas outside of Montreal to facilitate their integration to Quebec society. In March 2001, he announced that the numbers of both educated and francophone immigrants to Quebec were increasing and that the province would look to the Maghreb for more francophone immigration in upcoming years.
In late 2000, Simard said that he would not serve alongside Yves Michaud, a candidate for the PQ nomination in an upcoming Montreal by-election. Michaud had characterized Jewish support for the Canadian federalist option in the 1995 Quebec referendum as an "ethnic vote against the sovereignty of the Quebec people" and described B'nai Brith Canada as "anti-sovereigntist extremists." He was also quoted as saying that Jews believed themselves to be "the only people in the world who have suffered." Simard described Michaud's comments as "an old anti-Semitic throwback that leave me no choice but to condemn." Michaud, in turn, contended that he was "falsely demonized" by the reporting of his comments and was not anti-Semitic. This controversy exposed divisions in the ranks of the PQ and is widely believed to have provoked Lucien Bouchard's resignation as premier shortly thereafter.
President of the Treasury Board.
When Bouchard resigned from office in early 2001, Simard supported Bernard Landry's successful bid to become the party's new leader. Landry was sworn in as premier on 8 March 2001, and reassigned Simard as president of the treasury board, minister of state for administration and the public service, minister responsible for administration and the public service, and minister responsible for the Outaouais.
Simard issued his first report as treasury board president on 29 March 2001, indicating that government spending would increase by 3.1% in 2001-02 with three-quarters of the new revenues going to health and education. He added that spending as a percentage of gross domestic product would decline, as it had in previous years. Later in 2001, he announced that Quebec would take nearly one billion dollars from its reserve fund to avoid going into deficit amid a serious North American economic downturn. In November 2001, Simard launched a $220 million initiative to ensure pay equity.
Simard launched a major recruitment campaign in early 2001, seeking to fill 1,500 full-time and 5,000 part-time public service positions. This was described as the department's most important outreach program in twenty years. In making the announcement, Simard indicated that minority groups, including anglophones and youth, would receive fair representation.
Simard also served on a cabinet committee overseeing strategies for Quebec's asbestos sector in this period.
Minister of Education.
Bernard Landry shuffled his cabinet on 30 January 2002, and reassigned Simard as minister of state for education and employment, minister of education, minister responsible for employment, and minister responsible for the Outaouais. Simard delivered an education policy statement in March 2002, in which he promised to maintain Quebec's longstanding freeze on university tuition rates and remove a legislative loophole that allowed non-anglophone parents to send their children to English public schools after one year at an English private school.
He announced a $91 million program for reforming Quebec's secondary schools in January 2003, highlighted by increased tutoring, a focus on history and the French language as well as upgrades to the sciences, and new steps to target the provincial dropout rate. He introduced another plan in the same month to counter schoolyard harassment and intimidation. He was strongly critical of the right-wing Action démocratique du Québec's proposal to introduce a system of school vouchers to the province.
Simard was one of the few ministers in the Landry government with a strong interest in promoting Quebec sovereignty. In February 2003, he argued that Quebec would receive an additional $800 million in education spending if the "fiscal imbalance" between Quebec and the Canadian federal government was fixed.
Opposition member.
The Liberal Party under Jean Charest defeated the PQ in the 2003 provincial election. Simard was re-elected in Richelieu by a reduced margin and served as opposition critic for the treasury board and public service. He was named as the PQ's chief organizer in October 2004. Simard was strongly critical of the Charest government's cuts to economic development and the public service, as well as its move toward public-private partnerships. In 2006, he brought forward a private member's bill to create a pension benefits guarantee fund.
Simard called for a public inquiry into federalist spending practices during the 1995 referendum on sovereignty in 2005, following statements by a high-ranking Liberal Party of Canada organizer that the federalist side had "violated" and "flouted" Quebec's election laws. Simard was quoted as saying, "We don't want to rewrite the past. What is done is done. What we need are new ground rules and the means to ensure that that this doesn't happen again."
Simard supported Bernard Landry's bid to retain the PQ leadership after the 2003 election, but nonetheless helped Landry reach his decision to resign after receiving only 76 per cent support at the party's June 2005 convention. Later in the same year, Simard supported André Boisclair's successful bid to succeed Landry as party leader.
Simard suggested lifting Quebec's tuition freeze in 2006, arguing that it had created a state of "perpetual underfunding" for universities. The PQ's youth wing opposed this suggestion, and a subsequent policy workshop reaffirmed the party's support for the freeze.
The PQ fell to a third-place finish in the 2007 general election, and Simard was again re-elected by a reduced margin over a strong challenge from an ADQ candidate. Following the election, he was one of the few PQ MNAs who still supported Boisclair's leadership. When Boisclair resigned, Simard planned to support Gilles Duceppe's bid to lead the party. Duceppe ultimately decided not to run, and Pauline Marois was chosen as Boisclair's successor.
The PQ returned to official opposition status in the 2008 election under Marois's leadership, and Sylvain was re-elected by an increased margin. He was re-appointed as critic for the treasury board and public service after the election. In March 2009, he argued that the government could save four billion dollars by building two new university teaching hospitals in Montreal as conventional projects rather than as private-public partnerships. The following year, he accused the Charest government of falsifying cost estimates to favour the public-private approach.
In early 2011, Pauline Marois said that she favoured extending Quebec's Charter of the French Language to restrict non-anglophone students from attending English-language CEGEPs. Simard openly disagreed with this policy approach, which was approved by delegates to a PQ convention in April 2011.
In May 2011, Simard introduced a private member's bill to protect whistleblowers in the Quebec civil service.
In June 2012 he announced that he would not run for re-election.

Edward Harris (archaeologist)

Edward Cecil Harris, is a prominent Bermudian archaeologist. He is best known for the "Harris matrix", developed in February 1973 and considered by some to be the "industry standard" for stratigraphic archaeology. This was followed by a five-year investigation into archaeological practices. He determined that the methods did not properly account for stratigraphy, and published his findings in 1979 as the "Principles of Archaeological Stratigraphy".
While attending Columbia University School of General Studies in the United States, Harris spent the summers assisting on archaeological digs in Winchester, England. After graduating, he continued his archaeological work, including in Bergen, Norway and along the Persian Gulf. In 1997 he worked towards a PhD through the University of London, while working on excavations in New Guinea. 
In 1982, Harris became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and in 1991 he became a Fellow at the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University. Outside of academia, Harris has been awarded the "Palmetto Award" by the Bermuda National Trust, for his efforts in the historical preservation of several buildings in 1994.
In Bermuda, Harris served as the executive director of the National Museum of Bermuda, and writes a history column, entitled "Heritage Matters", for the local newspaper. He is a frequent contributor to the annual "Bermuda Journal of Archaeology and Maritime History", and has served as its editor.

Beyer Speed Figure

The Beyer Speed Figure is a system for rating the performance of Thoroughbred racehorses in North America designed in the early 1970s by Andrew Beyer, the syndicated horse racing columnist for The Washington Post. First published in book form in 1975, the Daily Racing Form began incorporating Beyer Speed Figures in a horse's past performances in 1992 and the system now assigns a Beyer number for each horse race. On the Beyer scale, the top stakes horses in the United States and Canada typically earn numbers in the 100s, while extremely strong performances can rate in the 120s. In Europe, Timeform has a similar rating scale that yields a number, but with a different value. The popular rule of thumb for a rough equivalent of the Timeform score is to deduct 12-14 points to achieve the Beyer figure. For American Quarter Horse racing, the Speed index rating system is used.
The Beyer Speed Figure is calculated by looking at the final time and distance of the race, adjusted by the track variant, which is a measure of the inherent speed of the racetrack in question. The track variant considers both the historical average time at the racetrack for the distance in question, called the "par time", and the average speed for the day in particular. The latter calculation compensates for a racetrack running faster or slower than usual. The Beyer Speed Figure specifically does "not" consider other variables such as the early pace or traffic problems a horse may have faced during a given race. The figure may, however, be adjusted if the raw numbers are unusual based on the field's previous performances. The figures are generally less reliable in turf races, which often have a slow early pace resulting in slow final times that do not reflect the horse's true speed.
Records.
The record for the highest Beyer Speed figure is held by Groovy, the 1987 American Champion Sprint Horse who earned 133 and 132 in back-to-back races, in the Roseben and True North Handicaps at six furlongs in 1987. (Note that this speed figure was assigned before the numbers were published in the Daily Racing Form, so may not be included in some listings of the top speed figures.) 
In 2004, Ghostzapper earned the highest Beyer Speed Figure for the year at 128 while winning the Philip H. Iselin Stakes. 
Formal Gold ran successive numbers of 126, 124 and 125 in 1997 in the Whitney Handicap (actually losing by a nose to Will's Way), Iselin Handicap and Woodward Stakes.
Flightline earned a 126 speed figure in winning the 2022 Pacific Classic Stakes at Del Mar Racetrack in 2022. 
Easy Goer and Sunday Silence both earned 124 speed figures in the 1989 Breeders' Cup Classic, which tied for the fastest speed figure earned in any Breeders' Cup race. Easy Goer also ran a 122 in winning the 1989 Belmont Stakes, the best Beyer Speed Figure in any Triple Crown race since these ratings were first published in 1987. He is also the record-holder for a two-year-old, earning a 116 Beyer Speed Figure in the 1988 Champagne Stakes.
In 2007 the highest Beyer Speed Figure was 124 assigned to Midnight Lute in the 7 furlong Forego Handicap at Saratoga Race Course. 
Commentator, who once ran a 123 in his career, scored a 120 as a 7-year-old, possibly a record for a horse that old. Alysheba ran a 122 speed figure in his career. Holy Bull earned a 121 in his career. 
Top Beyer Speed Figures earned.
Beyer speculated that had his figures existed in 1973, Secretariat would have scored 139 in his classic 1973 win at the Belmont Stakes. This implies that Secretariat would have had the highest ever Beyer speed figure. However, Beyer also acknowledged that by some calculations, Count Fleet's Beyer speed figures might have reached 150.
As Beyer has noted, a speed figure is a numerical expression of a horse's final time, universalized for distance, track surface, and the daily variant on that surface. While Beyer has also noted that "speed figures tell you how fast a horse ran in the past; they do not necessarily predict how it will run today," their use as a handicapping tool is premised on their ability to shed light on how a horse is likely to run in its next start. In "Betting Thoroughbreds", Steve Davidowitz claimed that (in 1974), "the top-figure horse wins 35 percent of the time, at a slight loss for every $2.00 wagered." This is an example of using the top figure as a "power rating," or singular measure of a horse's ability. In horse racing, power ratings are generally called class ratings. Because multiple horses are in each race, as opposed to two teams (binary) in a sport (or chess, which uses the Elo rating system to make power ratings), the task of adjusting power ratings is much more complex. Several other companies produce and sell power ratings, but most do not reveal their precise methodology.
History.
The first published work on creating speed-figures was E.W. Donaldson's "Consistent Handicapping Profits" (1936), which was cited by Jerry Brown as the method on which the Ragozin and Brown "sheet" figures are based. The Beyer numbers trace their roots back to the work of Ray Taulbot's parallel-time chart (1959), with Beyer pointing out the flaw of adding a fixed amount of time to slow or fast times at other distances, driving the numbers out of proportion. In 1963, Taulbot sent his parallel-time chart to Beyer's Harvard classmate, Sheldon Kovitz, who adjusted it to account for velocity (e.g., a horse who runs six furlongs in 1:09 will run its seventh furlong faster than one who runs 1:13, and so forth). From this work, using the same principle, Kovitz derived the beaten-lengths chart which Beyer published in "Picking Winners." 
Beyer's subsequent research added the last piece of the puzzle. In "Picking Winners", Beyer claimed a breakthrough when a study of claiming races at Calder Race Course showed Beyer that 1:13 for six furlongs was equally fast to 1:26.1 at seven; from there, Kovitz's math was used to generate perfectly accurate parallel-time and beaten-lengths charts, which Beyer then used to make "par times" for classes, against which each race is measured to determine if the track is faster or slower than normal. Each day's races are compared to their pars, with the variant representing the average deviation, and then added to the raw speed rating to yield the par-time based figure. Once horses have built a figure history, Beyer projects a figure based on the figures earned by the horses in the race, in place of the par, making the numbers much more accurate. For example, a horse who earns three consecutive figures of 102, and defeats a horse with three consecutive figures of 92, would indicate a projected figure of 102 for that race is accurate. Sometimes, variants are split during the day if the surface changes drastically enough.
In 1992, Beyer began making turf figures, which were made more accurate by his adjustment of the beaten-lengths chart, in which he uses the six-and-a-half furlong beaten-lengths chart for all races at that distance or longer, to reflect the nature of turf racing, where horses jockey for position most of the way, and then sprint home with almost all of their energy in reserve, making the competitive part of the race more akin to a sprint than to the race's actual distance.

Voorhees Mall

Voorhees Mall is a large grassy area with stately shade trees on a block (sometimes known as "Voorhees Campus") of about 28 acres (0.11 km2) located on the College Avenue Campus of Rutgers University near downtown New Brunswick, New Jersey. An eclectic mix of architectural styles, Voorhees Mall is lined by many historic academic buildings. The block is bound by Hamilton Street (to the east), George Street (north), College Avenue (south) and Seminary Place (west). At the mall's western end, across Seminary Place, is the campus of the New Brunswick Theological Seminary, whose history is intertwined with the early history of Rutgers University. Across Hamilton Street is the block called Old Queens, the seat of the university.
The mall bisecting the block was formed when Bleecker Place, a city street, was closed. After several generous donations to Rutgers, including the first building dedicated to housing the institution's library (now known as Voorhees Hall), the grassy mall was named for Ralph and Elizabeth Rodman Voorhees.
Voorhees Mall was once the site of annual commencement exercises for Rutgers College.
Selected buildings.
Riverstede (1868).
Professor George H. Cook (for whom the Cook campus of Rutgers University was named) erected this Italianate-Victorian brownstone which he named "Riverstede" as his home in 1868. It later was the home of William Henry Steele Demarest (1863–1956), eleventh President of Rutgers University (from 1906 to 1924), during his tenure as President of the New Brunswick Theological Seminary from 1924 to 1934. Today, Riverstede houses various offices for the Rutgers School of Social Work, however, previously it was home to Campus Information Services, the Raritan Club, the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, the "Partisan Review", a female graduate student residence, the Rutgers Religious Ministry and the Office of Career Services.
New Jersey Hall (1889).
New Jersey Hall was built from funds authorized by the New Jersey state legislature to construct an "Agricultural Hall" to house the State Experiment Station (now part of the Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences, formerly Cook College). It initially housed the college's departments of Chemistry and Biology. Today, New Jersey Hall houses the university's Department of Economics and the New Jersey Bureau of Economic Research. It is primarily an office building.
Recent efforts have been made to rename New Jersey Hall in honor of Nobel laureate Milton Friedman who graduated from Rutgers College with a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) in 1932.
Ballantine Gymnasium (1894–1931).
Ballantine Hall was mostly destroyed by fire in the 1930s. The rear of the building remained standing, and when the College Avenue Gymnasium was built a few blocks away, Ballantine Hall was used for classroom space. The Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum expanded over the remains of the Ballantine Gym, and the intact tiled pool is today used for storage. Parts of the old Ballantine facade can be seen in the parking lot behind the art museum and in the George Street entrance.
Voorhees Hall (1903).
Originally built to house the Rutgers College library, this building is named for Ralph and Elizabeth Rodman Voorhees. The main library was later moved to the Archibald S. Alexander Library. Voorhees Hall later hosted the University Art Gallery which became the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum in 1983. Today it houses the university's Department of Art History and the Art History Library which was expanded into an addition to Voorhees Hall in 2002.
Murray Hall (1909).
Originally built to house the College of Engineering, Murray Hall was designed by alumnus Douwe D. Williamson (Rutgers College Class of 1870) and Frederick P. Hill (Rutgers College Class of 1883). Built partly with a gift from steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie, Murray Hall was named for David Murray, professor of mathematics and astronomy at Rutgers College and college trustee. Murray assisted George Cook in establishing the Rutgers Scientific School (now part of Cook College) and in getting Rutgers named a land-grant college under the Morrill Act of 1862. Today, Murray Hall houses classrooms and the university's Department of English and Writing Program; the College of Engineering (now named the School of Engineering) has since relocated to Busch Campus in Piscataway.
Milledoler Hall (1910).
Originally called the Chemistry Building, Milledoler Hall is named for Reverend Philip Milledoler (1775–1852), professor of didactic theology in the New Brunswick Theological Seminary, trustee of Queen's College, and fifth President of Rutgers College from 1825 to 1840. Rev. Milledoler was also the person who suggested the name of the college be changed from Queen's College to Rutgers College in 1825. He wanted to honor Colonel Henry Rutgers, a Revolutionary War hero and a member of his congregation. Currently, this building houses several administrative offices for Rutgers College, including the Office of the Dean, as well as one lecture hall.
Graduate School of Education.
The Graduate School of Education was originally part of the Graduate School-New Brunswick, founded in 1876 and one of the oldest graduate schools in the country. The GSE separated from the Graduate School in 1923 and its present building was constructed in 1961. Supported by stilts at its southern end, the Graduate School of Education is built in the Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired Cantilever style of architecture.
Academic Buildings (2016).
The Academic Buildings were constructed at the eastern end of Voorhees Mall in 2016, replacing a portion of the New Brunswick Theological Seminary campus. The land for the building was acquired as part of a deal between Rutgers and the Seminary, in which Rutgers took over most of Holy Hill (upon which the former Seminary campus was built) in exchange for constructing a new Seminary campus. Each building contains classrooms, lecture halls, and study spaces, with the northern building housing some Rutgers academic departments.
Honors College (2015).
The Honors College was constructed in 2015, alongside the Academic Buildings. The building, a mixture of seminar-style classrooms, lounges, and four floors of traditional student dorm rooms, opened in Fall 2015 alongside the launch of the Honors College program.
School of Social Work.
The Rutgers School of Social Work was built as the home of the School of Ceramics (now the Department of Materials Science and Engineering) in 1922. The structural and design elements of the building are fabricated entirely of ceramic materials donated by the ceramics industry of New Jersey. The floor of the room consists entirely of hand-laid artistic tile, including a pre-Nazi use of a then-innocuous pattern now known as the swastika. The Ceramic Engineering Department moved to Busch Campus in 1963 when the Engineering Building was constructed.
Van Dyck Hall (1928).
Van Dyck Hall was built in 1928 and named after the first dean of Rutgers College, Francis C Van Dyck. Originally, it was part of the Rutgers Scientific School and housed the Physics department. Today, Van Dyck Hall houses classrooms and the university's Department of History.
Ford Hall (1915).
Ford Hall was the second dormitory on campus, built in 1915. Underneath the dorm is an old tunnel, dug in the 18th century to mine copper. The tunnel stretches from Mine Street, a few blocks down College Avenue and supposedly was used to help runaway slaves as part of the Underground Railroad and to smuggle alcohol during Prohibition . Ford Hall was most recently used a graduate student dormitory, but is currently closed and being converted to offices for the School of Arts and Sciences. It is named for John U. Ford, a trustee of the university and former entrepreneur in the rubber industry. The building was designed by architect Bertram Goodhue, also known for Gothic revival churches, the Los Angeles Public Library, and the Nebraska state capitol building. As of 2025, it still sits dormant.
Scott Hall (1963).
Named for Austin Scott (1848–1922), the tenth President of Rutgers University and a history and political science professor, Scott Hall is a modern structure built in 1963. It is used as one of the campus's major classroom buildings, along with Murray Hall, Hardenbergh Hall, Frelinghuysen Hall, and Campbell Hall. The building's large auditorium classrooms are often used for movies, plays, and other gatherings as well as classes.
William the Silent.
Fenton B. Turck, a New York physician and biologist, with the assistance of railroad magnate, and longtime Rutgers alumnus and trustee, Leonor F. Loree (Rutgers College Class of 1877), anonymously donated a statue of Prince William the Silent (1533–1584) of the House of Nassau and later Prince of Orange, who was the leader of the Dutch rebellion against the Spanish that set off the Eighty Years' War and resulted in the formal independence of the United Provinces in 1648. Turck, of Dutch extraction, intended to give the statue to the University to signify the institution's Dutch roots. He kept the statue in the basement of his laboratory in Manhattan for eight years before it was unveiled on the present Voorhees Mall on 9 June 1928. This statue is the only replica of the original that stands in The Hague.

Petar Zanev

Petar Dimitrov Zanev (; born 18 October 1985) is a Bulgarian retired footballer who played as a left back.
Club career.
Zanev was born in Gotse Delchev and joined the youth system of his hometown club Pirin at an early age. In early 2005 he signed with Litex Lovech.
Celta (loan).
On 17 June 2007, Celta manager Hristo Stoichkov unveiled Zanev as the club's first signing ahead of 2007–08 season. On the next day, Zanev signed for the Spanish Segunda División side on a season-long loan deal, with the club having the option to make the move permanent. On 26 August, he made his league debut in their 1–1 draw against Córdoba CF, but spent most of his time with Celta on the bench, making only three appearances. Because of this, midway through the season his contract was terminated.
Racing Ferrol (loan).
On 9 January 2008, Racing Ferrol confirmed Zanev has joined on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut on 27 January in a 3–1 away win over SD Eibar, coming on as a substitute for Jonathan Pereira. Zanev appeared 14 times for Ferrol in the Segunda División.
Return to Litex.
Zanev returned to Litex Lovech at the end of the 2007–08 season. On 18 May 2011, he scored his second league goal in his career in a 4–1 win over Montana. Zanev's third official goal for Litex came on 19 July 2011, netting the first of a 3–0 home win over Mogren Budva in the second qualifying round of the Champions League, this also being Zanev's first European goal.
Volyn Lutsk.
In early July 2012, Zanev signed a three-year contract with Ukrainian club Volyn Lutsk.
Amkar Perm.
Zanev signed with Russian Premier League side Amkar Perm on 30 June 2013 on a three-year deal. He was given the number 3 jersey.
Yenisey Krasnoyarsk.
On 25 June 2018, following the bankruptcy of Amkar, he joined FC Yenisey Krasnoyarsk that was promoted for the first time into the Russian Premier League. He left Yenisey on 3 April 2019.
CSKA Sofia.
On 29 May 2019 CSKA Sofia announced to have signed a contract with Zanev, following a period when he was training with the team.
International career.
In 2006 Hristo Stoichkov called up the left back to the Bulgaria national team. Zanev made his official debut for Bulgaria in a friendly match against Slovakia on 15 November 2006. The result of the match was a 1:3 loss for Bulgaria. He was sent off (after receiving a second caution) for the first time on 15 October 2013, in the 0:1 home loss against the Czech Republic in a World Cup qualifier. After being overlooked for the Euro 2016 qualifiers, Zanev's good performances in the Russian Premier League saw him make a return to the national side for the 2018 World Cup qualification matches. On 7 October 2017, he captained the national team, in the 0:1 home loss against France in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.

<doc id="6934263" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6934263" title="Sahitya Akademi Award">
Sahitya Akademi Award

The Sahitya Akademi Award is a literary honour in India, which the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, annually confers on writers of the most outstanding books of literary merit published in any of the 22 languages of the 8th Schedule to the Indian constitution as well as in English and Rajasthani language.
Established in 1954, the award comprises a plaque and a cash prize of ₹ 100,000. The award's purpose is to recognise and promote excellence in Indian writing and acknowledge new trends. The annual process of selecting awardees runs for the preceding twelve months. The plaque awarded by the Sahitya Akademi was designed by the Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray. Prior to this, the plaque occasionally was made of marble, but this practice was discontinued because of the excessive weight. During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, the plaque was substituted with national savings bonds.
Other literary honors.
Sahitya Akademi Fellowships.
They form the highest honor which the Akademi confers through a system of electing Fellows and Honorary Fellows. (Sahitya Akademi Award is the second-highest literary honor next to a Sahitya Akademi Fellowship).
Bhasha Samman.
Sahitya Akademy gives these special awards to writers for significant contribution to Indian languages other than the above 24 major ones and also for contributions to classical and medieval literature. Like the Sahitya Akademi Awards, Bhasha Samman too comprise a plaque and a cash prize of ₹100,000 (from 2009). The Sahitya Akademi instituted the Bhasha Samman in 1996 to be given to writers, scholars, editors, collectors, performers or translators who have made considerable contribution to the propagation, modernization or enrichment of the languages concerned. The Samman carries a plaque along with an amount equal to its awards for creative literature i.e. ₹100,000. It was ₹25,000 at the time of inception, increased to ₹40,000 from 2001, ₹50,000 from 2003 and to ₹100,000 from 2009. The Sammans are given to 3-4 persons every year in different languages on the basis of recommendations of experts' committees constituted for the purpose.
The first Bhasha Sammans were awarded to Dharikshan Mishra for Bhojpuri, Bansi Ram Sharma and M.R. Thakur for Pahari (Himachali), K. Jathappa Rai and Mandara Keshava Bhat for Tulu and Chandra Kanta Mura Singh for Kokborok, for their contribution to the development of their respective languages.
Sahitya Akademi Prize for Translation.
Awards for translations were instituted in 1989 at the insistence of then-Prime Minister of India, P. V. Narasimha Rao. The Sahitya Akademi annually gives these awards for outstanding translations of major works in other languages into one of the 24 major Indian languages. The awards comprise a plaque and a cash prize of ₹50,0000. The initial proposal for translation prizes contained provisions for a prize for translations into each of the twenty-two languages recognised by the Akademi; however, this was soon found to be unviable for several reasons: the Akademi found that there were insufficient entries in all the languages, and there were difficulties in locating experts knowledgeable in both, the language of translation and the original language, to judge the translations. Consequently, the Board decided to dispense with its original requirement for additional expert committees to evaluate the translations and also ruled that it was not obligated to grant prizes in languages where suitable books were not nominated. The Akademi also requires that both, the original author as well as the translator, are to be Indian nationals.
Over time, the Akademi has modified and expanded the conditions for the Translation Prizes. In 1982, the Akademi began to allow translations made in link languages to be eligible for the Awards, although it noted that translations made directly from the original language would always be preferred. In 1985, the Akademi also held that joint translations would be eligible, and in 1997, it dispensed with the process of advertising for nominations and replaced it with invitations for recommendations from advisory boards and Committee members. As of 2006, 268 prizes have been awarded to 256 translators.
Golden Jubilee Awards.
On the occasion of its Golden Jubilee, Sahitya Akademi awarded the following prizes for outstanding works of poetry in translation from Indian languages.
The Golden Jubilee Prizes for Life Time Achievement and young achievers were awarded to Namdeo Dhasal, Ranjit Hoskote, Mandakranta Sen, Abdul Rasheed, Sithara S. and Neelakshi Singh.
Ananda Coomarswamy Fellowships.
Named after the Ceylon Tamil writer Ananda Coomaraswamy, the fellowship was started in 1996. It is given to scholars from Asian countries to spend three to twelve months in India to pursue a literary project.
Premchand Fellowships.
Named after Hindi and Urdu writer Premchand, the fellowship was started in 2005. It is given to persons of eminence in the field of Culture from SAARC countries. Notable awardees include Intizar Hussain, Selina Hossain, Yasmine Gooneratne, Jean Arasanayagam and Kishwar Naheed.
Returns and Declines of Sahitya Akademi Awards.
The Akademi has seen several instances of Awards being returned or declined as an act of protest.
1950s–1980s.
In 1973, G.A. Kulkarni returned the Award for his collection of short stories in Marathi, "Kajal Maya," because a controversy had arisen regarding the date of publication of the book and its consequent eligibility for the Award. In 1969, Swami Anand declined the Award for contributions to Gujarati literature on the grounds that his religious beliefs precluded him from accepting any pecuniary benefits for public services.
In 1981, Telugu writer V. R. Narla was given the Sahitya Akademi Award for his play, "Sita Josyam", but returned it on the grounds that the Akademi had allowed an adverse review of the play to be published in their journal, "Indian Literature." In 1982, Deshbandhu Dogra Natan was given the Sahitya Akademi award for his Dogri novel, "Qaidi" ('Prisoner') but returned it on the grounds that he should have received the Award much earlier. In 1983, Gujarati writer Suresh Joshi also returned the Award on the grounds that his book, "Chintayami Manasa", did not, in his opinion, deserve the Award, and also expressed the opinion that the Award was generally granted to authors who were "spent forces". This provoked a response from the then-President of the Akademi, Vinayaka Krishna Gokak, who said, concerning the awards that, "It is not possible to generalise on the basis of age. Nor can we expect the Akademi panels to be on the watch for a literary force on the upward curve and catch it at the moment before it starts going downwards. Panels change from year to year and they have to select not literary men but literary works which are adjudged to be the best among the publications of a particular period."
1990s.
In 1998, Gujarati writer Jayant Kothari also declined the Sahitya Akademi Award on the grounds that he had made a religious vow that precluded his acceptance of any competitive award, prize or position. In 1991, Jagannatha Prasad Das, who was given the Award for his poetry in Odia declined for 'personal reasons'. In 1996, T. Padmanabhan, who was given the Award for a book of short stories in Malayalam, declined on the grounds that the Akademi had not shown interest in supporting the short story form, although he noted that he was grateful to the Akademi for the honour.
2000s.
, the award has been returned by many writers for various reasons. 38 recipients had announced their returning of the award in protest of the "rising intolerance in India" under the Modi government as also the murder of author M M Kalburgi and the Dadri lynching incident. Among others, Ajmer Aulakh, Aman Sethi, Ganesh Devy, Kum Veerabhadrappa and Shashi Deshpande have publicly announced their return of the award. To show their condemnation Deshpande, K Satchidanandan, PK Parakkadvu and Aravind Malagatti have also resigned their posts at the Sahitya Akademi institution.
The recipients who announced to return the awards include: Ajmer Singh Aulakh (Punjabi), Ambika Dutt (Hindi), Anil R. Joshi (Gujarati), Ashok Vajpeyi (Hindi), Atamjit Singh (Punjabi), Baldev Singh Sadaknama (Punjabi), Bhoopal Reddy (Telugu), Chaman Lal (Hindi), Darshan Buttar (Punjabi), Ganesh Devy (Gujarati/English), Ghulam Nabi Khayal (Kashmiri), GN Ranganatha Rao (Kannada), Gurbachan Singh Bhullar (Punjabi), Homen Borgohain (Assamese) Jaswinder Singh (Punjabi), K. Katyayani Vidhmahe (Telugu), Kashi Nath Singh (Hindi), Keki N. Daruwalla (English), Krishna Sobti (Hindi), Kumbar Veerabhadrappa (Kannada), Mandakranta Sen (Bengali), Manglesh Dabral (Hindi), Marghoob Banihali (Kashmiri), Mohan Bhandari (Punjabi), Munawwar Rana (Urdu), Nand Bhardwaj (Rajasthani), Nayantara Sahgal (English), Nirupama Borgohain (Assamese), Rahman Abbas (Urdu), Rahamat Tarikere (Kannada), Rajesh Joshi (Hindi), Sarah Joseph (Malayalam), Srinath DN (Kannada), Surjit Patar (Punjabi), Uday Prakash (Hindi), and Waryam Singh Sandhu (Punjabi).

History of Beijing

The city of Beijing has a long and rich history that dates back over 3,000 years.
Prior to the unification of China by the First Emperor in 221 BC, Beijing had been for centuries the capital of the ancient states of Ji and Yan. It was a provincial center in the earliest unified empires of China, Qin and Han. The northern border of ancient China ran close to the present city of Beijing, and northern nomadic tribes frequently broke in from across the border. Thus, the area that was to become Beijing emerged as an important strategic and a local political centre. During the first millennia of imperial rule, Beijing was a provincial city in northern China. Its stature grew in the 10th to the 13th centuries when the nomadic Khitan and forest-dwelling Jurchen peoples from beyond the Great Wall expanded southward and made the city a capital of their dynasties, the Liao and Jin. When Kublai Khan made Dadu the capital of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty (1279–1368), all of China was ruled from Beijing for the first time. From 1279 onward, with the exception of two interludes from 1368 to 1420 and 1928 to 1949, Beijing would remain as China's capital, serving as the seat of power for the Ming dynasty (1421–1644), the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644–1912), the early Republic of China (1912–1928) and now the People's Republic of China (1949–present).
Prehistory.
The earliest remains of hominid habitation in Beijing Municipality were found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where the "Homo erectus" Peking Man (previously classified as the now-invalid species "Sinanthropus pekinensis") lived from 770,000 to 230,000 years ago. Paleolithic "homo sapiens" also lived in the caves from about 27,000 to 10,000 years ago.
In 1996, over 2,000 Stone Age tools and bone fragments were discovered at a construction site at Wangfujing in the heart of downtown Beijing in Dongcheng District. The artifacts date to 24,000 to 25,000 years ago and are preserved in the Wangfujing Paleolithic Museum in the lower level of the New Oriental Plaza mall.
Archaeologists have discovered over 40 neolithic settlements and burial sites throughout the municipality. The most notable include Zhuannian of Huairou District; Donghulin of Mentougou District; Shangzhai and Beiniantou of Pinggu District; Zhenjiangying of Fangshan; and Xueshan of Changping District. These sites indicate that farming was widespread in the area 6,000 to 7,000 years ago. Painted pottery and carved jade of the Shangzhai and Xueshan Cultures resemble those of the Hongshan Culture further to the north.
Pre-imperial history.
The earliest events of Beijing's history are shrouded in legend and myth. The epic Battle of Banquan, which according to Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian", occurred in the 26th century BC, may have taken place near the Upper and Lower Banquan Villages of Yanqing County on the northwestern edge of Beijing Municipality. The triumph of the Yellow Emperor over the Yan Emperor at Banquan united the two Emperors' tribes and gave rise to the "Huaxia" or Chinese nation, which then defeated Chiyou and the Nine Li tribes in the Battle of Zhuolu, possibly at Zhuolu, west of Yanqing in Hebei Province. This victory opened North China to settlement by the descendants of the Yan and Yellow Emperors.
The Yellow Emperor is said to have founded the settlement of Youling () in or near Zhuolu. The sage-king Yao founded a town called Youdu () in the Hebei-Beijing region about 4,000 years ago. You () or Youzhou () later became one of the historical names for Beijing. Yuzishan, in Shandongzhuang Village of Pinggu County, in the northeastern fringe of Beijing Municipality, is one of several places in China claiming to host the Yellow Emperor's Tomb. Yuzishan's association with Yellow Emperor dates back at least 1,300 years when Tang poets Chen Zi'ang and Li Bai mentioned the tomb in their poems about Youzhou.
The first event in Beijing's history with archaeological support dates to the 11th century BC when the Zhou dynasty absorbed the Shang dynasty. According to Sima Qian, King Wu of Zhou, in the 11th year of his reign, deposed the last Shang king and conferred titles to nobles within his domain including the rulers of the city states Ji () and Yan (). According to Confucius, King Wu of Zhou was so eager to establish his legitimacy that before dismounting his chariot, he named the descendants of the Yellow Emperor as the rulers of Ji. He then named his kinsman, Shi, the Duke of Shao, as the vassal of Yan. Shi was preoccupied with other matters and dispatched his eldest son to take the position. This son, Ke, is considered the founder of the state of Yan. Bronzeware inscriptions have confirmed these events described in Sima Qian's history. Although the dates in Sima Qian's history before 841 BC have not yet been definitely matched to the Gregorian Calendar, the Beijing Government uses 1045BC as the official estimate of the date of this occasion.
It is believed that the seat of Ji, called the City of Ji or Jicheng (), was located in the southwestern part of present-day urban Beijing, just south of Guang'anmen in Xicheng and Fengtai Districts. Several historical accounts mention a "Hill of Ji" northwest of the city, which would correspond to the large mound at the White Cloud Abbey outside Xibianmen, about north of Guang'anmen. South and west of Guang'anmen, roof tiles used for palace construction and dense concentrations of wells lined with ceramic ring tiles have been discovered.
The capital of Yan was located about to the south of Ji, in the village of Dongjialin in Liulihe Township of Fangshan District, where a large walled settlement and over 200 tombs of nobility have been unearthed. Among the most significant artifacts from the Liulihe Site is the three-legged bronze " Jin Ding" whose inscriptions recount the journey of Jin, who was sent by Ji Ke to deliver a batch of food and drink to his father, Ji Shi, in the Zhou capital. The father was thrilled and awarded Jin cowry shells to pay for the creation of an honorific "ding" to remember the event. The inscription thus confirms the appointment of King Zhou's kin to Yan and the location of Yan's capital.
Both Yan and Ji were situated along an important north–south trade route along the eastern flank of the Taihang Mountains from the Central Plain to the northern steppes. Ji, located just north of the Yongding River, was a convenient rest stop for trade caravans. Here, the route to the northwest through the mountain passes diverged from the road to the Northeast. Ji also had a steady water supply from the nearby Lotus Pool, which still exists south of the Beijing West railway station. The Liulihe settlement relied on the more seasonal flow of the Liuli River. Some time during the Western Zhou or early Eastern Zhou dynasty, Yan conquered Ji and moved its capital to Ji, which continued to be called Jicheng or the City of Ji until the 2nd century AD. Due to its historical association with the State of Yan, the city of Beijing is also known as Yanjing () or the "Yan Capital."
The State of Yan continued to expand until it became one of the seven major powers during the Warring States period (473–221 BC). It stretched from the Yellow River to the Yalu. Like subsequent rulers of Beijing, the Yan also faced the threat of invasions by the Shanrong steppe nomads, and built walled fortifications across its northern frontier. Remnants of the Yan walls in Changping County date to 283 BC. They predate Beijing's better known Ming Great Wall by more than 1,500 years.
In 226 BC, the City of Ji fell to the invading State of Qin and the State of Yan was forced to move its capital to Liaodong. The Qin eventually ended Yan in 222 BC. The following year, the ruler of Qin, having conquered all the other states, declared himself to be the First Emperor.
Early imperial history.
During the first one thousand years of Chinese imperial history, Beijing was a provincial city on the northern periphery of China proper. Dynasties with capitals in the Central and Guanzhong Plains used the city to manage trade and military relations with nomadic peoples of the north and northeast.
The Qin dynasty built a highly centralized state and divided the country into 48 commanderies ("jun"), two of which are located in present-day Beijing. The City of Ji became the seat of Guangyang Commandery (广阳郡/廣陽郡). To the north, in present-day Miyun County, was Yuyang Commandery. The Qin removed defensive barriers dividing the Warring States, including the southern wall of the Yan, which separated the Beijing Plain from the Central Plain, and built a national roadway network. Ji served as the junction for the roads connecting the Central Plain with Mongolia and Manchuria. The First Emperor visited Ji in 215 BC and, to protect the frontier from the Xiongnu, had the Great Wall built in Yuyang Commandery and fortified Juyong Pass.
The Han dynasty, which followed the short-lived Qin in 206 BC, initially restored some local autonomy. Liu Bang, the founding emperor of the Han dynasty, recognized a number of regional kingdoms including Yan, ruled by Zang Tu, who had joined the revolt that overthrew the Qin, seized the City of Ji and sided with Liu Bang in the war with Xiang Yu for supremacy. But Zang rebelled and was executed, and Liu granted the kingdom to his childhood friend Lu Wan. Later, Liu became mistrustful of Lu, and the latter fled the City of Ji to join the Xiongnu tribes of the steppes. Liu Bang's eighth son took control of Yan, which was subsequently ruled by lineal princes of the imperial family, from the City of Ji, then known as Yan Commandery (燕郡), and the Principality of Guangyang (广阳国/廣陽國). In the early Western Han, the four counties of Guangyang Principality had 20,740 households and an estimated population of 70,685.
In 106 BC, under Emperor Wu, the country was organized into 13 prefectural-provinces, or "zhou" (), and the City of Ji served as the provincial capital for Youzhou (), the territories of which extended from what is now central Hebei Province to the Korean Peninsula. The tomb of Liu Jian, the Prince of Guangyang who ruled Youzhou from 73 to 45 BC was discovered in Fengtai District in 1974 and has been preserved in the Dabaotai Western Han Dynasty Mausoleum. In 1999, another royal tomb was found in Laoshan in Shijingshan District but the prince formerly buried there has not been identified.
During the early Eastern Han dynasty in 57 AD, the five counties of Guangyang Commandery had 44,550 households and an estimated 280,600 residents. By population density, Guangyang ranked in the top 20 among the 105 commanderies nationally. In the late Eastern Han, the Yellow Turban Rebellion erupted in Hebei in 184 AD and briefly seized Youzhou. The court relied on regional militaries to put down the rebellion and Youzhou was controlled successively by warlords Liu Yu, Gongsun Zan, Yuan Shao and Cao Cao. In 194 AD, Yuan Shao captured Ji from Gongsun Zan with the help of Wuhuan and Xianbei allies from the steppes. Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shao in 200 AD and the Wuhuan in 207 AD to pacify the north.
During the Three Kingdoms period, the Kingdom of Wei founded by Cao Cao's son, Cao Pi, controlled ten of the Han dynasty's prefectures including Youzhou and its capital Ji. The Wei court instituted offices in Youzhou to manage relations with the Wuhuan and Xianbei. To help sustain the troops garrisoned in Youzhou, the governor in 250 AD built the Lilingyan, an irrigation system that greatly improved agricultural output in the plains around Ji.
Ji was demoted to a mere county seat in the Western Jin dynasty, which made neighboring Zhuo County, in present-day Hebei Province, the prefectural capital of Youzhou. In the early 4th century, the Western Jin dynasty was overthrown by steppe peoples who had settled in northern China and established a series of mostly short-lived kingdoms. During the so-called Sixteen Kingdoms period, Beijing, still known as Ji, was controlled successively by the Di-led Former Qin, the Jie-led Later Zhao, and the Xianbei-led Former Yan and Later Yan. In 352, Prince Murong Jun, moved the capital of the Former Yan Kingdom from Manchuria to Ji, making the city a sovereign capital for the first time in over 500 years. Five years later, the Former Yan's capital was moved further south to Ye in southern Hebei. In 397 AD, the Northern Wei, another Xianbei regime, united northern China and restored Ji as the capital of Youzhou. While this designation continued through the remainder of the Northern Dynasties, the Eastern Wei, Northern Qi and Northern Zhou, the size of its jurisdiction shrank drastically, as the number of "zhou" in China was massively increased in this period, from 21 in the early 4th century to more than 200 in the late 6th century.
In 446, the Northern Wei built a Great Wall from Juyong Pass west to Shanxi to protect its capital, Datong, from the Rouran. In 553–56, the Northern Qi extended this Great Wall eastward to the Bohai Sea to defend against the Göktürks, who raided Youzhou in 564 and 578. Centuries of warfare severely depopulated northern China. During the Eastern Wei (534–550), Youzhou, Anzhou (modern Miyun) and East Yanzhou (modern Changping) had a combined 4,600 households and about 170,000 residents.
After the Sui dynasty reunited China in 589 AD, Youzhou was renamed Zhuojun or the Zhuo Commandery (), which was administered from Ji. In 609, Zhuo Commandery and neighboring Anle Commandery (modern Miyun) had a combined 91,658 households and an estimated population of 458,000. Emperor Yang of Sui built a network of canals from the Central Plain to Zhuojun to carry troops and food for the massive military campaigns against Goguryeo (Korea). Though the campaigns proved to be ruinous, they were continued by the Tang dynasty. In 645 AD, the Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty founded the Minzhong Temple (now Fayuan Temple) in the southeast of Ji to remember the war dead from the Korean Campaigns. The Fayuan Temple, now within Xicheng District, is one of the oldest temples in urban Beijing.
The Tang dynasty reduced the size of a prefecture, as a unit of administration administrative division, from a province to a commandery and renamed Zhuojun back to Youzhou, which was one of over 300 Tang Prefectures. With the creation of a separate prefecture called Jizhou () in present-day Tianjin in 730, the name Ji was transplanted from Beijing to Tianjin, where a Ji County () still exists today. In Beijing, the City of Ji gradually became known as Youzhou. During the prosperous early Tang, Youzhou's ten counties tripled in size from 21,098 households and about 102,079 residents to 67,242 households and 371,312 residents in 742. In 742, Youzhou was renamed Fanyang Commandery (), but reverted to Youzhou in 762.
To guard against barbarian invasions, the imperial court created six frontier military commands in 711 AD, and Youzhou became the headquarters of the Youzhou "Jiedushi", who was tasked to monitor the Khitan and Xi nomads just north of present-day Hebei Province. In 755, the "Jiedushi" An Lushan launched a rebellion from Youzhou, and declared himself the emperor of the Great Yan dynasty. He went on to conquer Luoyang and Xi'an with a multi-ethnic army of Han, Tongluo, Xi, Khitan and Shiwei troops. After An's death, Shi Siming continued the rebellion from Youzhou. Shi Siming's tomb was discovered in Wangzuo Village in Fengtai District in 1966 and excavated in 1981. The An–Shi Rebellion lasted eight years and severely weakened the Tang dynasty. For the next 150 years, military governors ruled Youzhou autonomously. 
When the Tang dynasty was overthrown in 907 by the Later Liang dynasty, Youzhou remained independent and its military governor Liu Shouguang declared himself emperor of the short-lived Jie Yan dynasty in 911. This regime was ended in 913 by the ethnic Shatuo general Li Cunxu who went on to found the Later Tang dynasty in 923. The disintegration of the Tang dynasty into the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms paved the way for Khitan expansion into northern China, which prompted the rise of Beijing in Chinese history.
The nomadic Khitan people were united under Yelü Abaoji, who founded the Liao dynasty in 916 and, from 917 to 928, tried seven times to take Youzhou. In 936, a rift in the Later Tang court allowed Yelü Abaoji to help another ethnic Shatuo general Shi Jingtang found the third of the Five Dynasties, the Later Jin. Shi Jingtang then ceded sixteen prefectures across the northern frontier including Youzhou, Shunzhou (modern Shunyi), Tanzhou (modern Changping) and Ruzhou (modern Yanqing) to the Liao dynasty.
Liao, Song and Jin dynasties.
Though Beijing was but a peripheral city to Chinese dynasties centered in Luoyang and Xi'an, it was an important entryway into China for tribal peoples to the north. The city's stature grew from the 10th century with successive invasions of China proper by the Khitans, Jurchens, and Mongols, who respectively founded the Liao dynasty, Jin dynasty and Yuan dynasty.
Liao Nanjing.
In 938, the Liao dynasty renamed Youzhou, Nanjing (南京) or the "Southern Capital" and made the city one of four secondary capitals to the primary seat of power at Shangjing (in modern-day Baarin Left Banner, Inner Mongolia). The Liao retained the Tang configuration of the city, which had eight gates in its outer wall, two in each cardinal direction, an inner walled city, which was converted into palace complex, and 26 residential neighborhoods.
Thus, the City of Ji, ceded to the Liao as Youzhou, continued as Nanjing in what is today the southwest part of urban Beijing. Some of the oldest landmarks in southern Xicheng (formerly Xuanwu) and Fengtai Districts date to the Liao era. They include Sanmiao Road, one of the oldest streets in Beijing and the Niujie Mosque, founded in 996, and the Tianning Temple, built from 1100 to 1119. Under Liao rule, the population inside the walled city grew from 22,000 in 938 to 150,000 in 1113 (and the population of the surrounding region grew from 100,000 to 583,000) as large numbers of Khitan, Xi, Shiwei and Balhae from the north and Han from the south migrated to the city.
The Song dynasty, after unifying the rest of China in 960, sought to recapture the lost northern territories. In 979, Emperor Taizong personally led a military expedition that reached and laid siege to Nanjing (Youzhou) but was defeated in the decisive Battle of Gaoliang River, just northwest of present-day Xizhimen.
In 1120, the Song entered the Alliance on the Sea with the Jurchens, a semi-agricultural, forest-dwelling people living northeast of the Liao in modern-day Manchuria. The two nations agreed to jointly invade the Liao and split captured territories, with most of the Sixteen Prefectures going to the Song. Under the leadership of Wanyan Aguda, who founded the Jin dynasty (1115–1234), the Jurchens captured in rapid succession the Liao's Upper, Central and Eastern Capitals.
In the spring of 1122, the Liao court rallied around Prince Yelü Chun in Nanjing, and defeated two Song army advances. After Yelü Chun died of illness in the early summer, Guo Yaoshi, an ethnic Han commander in the Liao Army, defected to the Song and led the vanguard of the Song Army in a raid on Nanjing. The raiders entered the city, but the Liao Empress Xiao continued to resist from the walled palace complex. After three days of street fighting, Liao reinforcements reached the city ahead of the main Song Army, and managed to expel Guo Yaoshi's forces. In the winter of 1122, the Jin Army drove through the Juyong Pass and marched on Nanjing from the north. This time, Empress Xiao fled to the steppes and the remaining Liao officials capitulated. Wanyan Aguda allowed the surrendering officials to retain their positions and encouraged refugees to return to the city, which was renamed Yanjing.
Song Yanshan.
In the spring of 1123, Wanyan Aguda agreed, as per treaty terms, to hand Yanjing and four other prefectures to the Song in exchange for tribute. The handover occurred after the Jurchens had looted the city's wealth and forced all officials and craftsman to move to the Jin capital at Shangjing (near present-day Harbin). Thus, the Song, having failed to take the city militarily from the Khitans, managed to purchase Yanjing from the Jurchens. Song rule of the city, renamed Yanshan (燕山), was short-lived.
As the convoy of relocated Nanjing residents passed Pingzhou (near Qinhuangdao) on their way to the Northeast, they persuaded the governor Zhang Jue to restore them to their home city. Zhang Jue, a former Liao official who had surrendered to the Jin dynasty, then switched his allegiance to the Song. Emperor Huizong welcomed his defection, ignoring warnings from his diplomats that the Jurchens would regard the acceptance of defectors as a breach of the treaty. The Jurchens defeated Zhang Jue who took refuge with Guo Yaoshi at Yanshan. The Song court had Zhang Jue executed to satisfy Jin demands, much to the alarm of Guo Yaoshi and other former Liao officials serving the Song.
The Jurchens, sensing Song weakness, used the Zhang Jue incident as a pretext to invade. In 1125, Jin forces defeated Guo Yaoshi at the Battle of the Bai River, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River in modern Miyun County. Guo Yaoshi then surrendered Yanshan and then guided the Jin's rapid advance on the Song capital, Kaifeng, where the Song emperors Huizong and Qinzong were captured in 1127, ending the Northern Song dynasty. Yanshan was renamed Yanjing.
Jin Zhongdu.
In 1153 the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang moved his capital from Shangjing to Yanjing and the city was renamed Zhongdu (中都) or the "Central Capital". For the first time in its history, the city of Beijing became a political capital of a major dynasty.
The Jin expanded the city to the west, east, and south, doubling its size. On today's map of urban Beijing, Zhongdu would extend from Xuanwumen in the northeast to the Beijing West railway station to the west, and south to beyond the southern 2nd Ring Road. The walled city had 13 gates, four in the north and three openings in each of the other sides. Remnants of Zhongdu city walls are preserved in Fengtai District. The Jin emphasized the centrality of the regime by placing the walled palace complex near the center of Zhongdu. The palace was situated south of present-day Guang'anmen and north of the Grand View Garden. In 1179, Emperor Zhangzong had a country retreat built northeast of Zhongdu. Taiye Lake was excavated along the Jinshui River and Daning Palace (/) was erected on Qionghua Island in the lake. The grounds of this palace is now Beihai Park.
Paper money was first issued in Beijing during the Jin. The Lugou Bridge, over the Yongding River southwest of the city, was built in 1189. Seventeen Jin emperors are buried in Fangshan District, including those whose tombs were originally built in Shangjing and moved to Zhongdu. The city's population grew from 82,000 in 1125 to 400,000 in 1207 (and from 340,000 in the surrounding region to 1.6 million).
Zhongdu served as the Jin capital for more than 60 years, until the onslaught of the Mongols in 1214. The Mongols, a tribal nomadic people from the Mongolian Plateau and southern Siberia, had assisted the Jurchen in the war against the Khitans, but were not given the promised compensation. In 1211, the Mongols led by Genghis Khan took revenge against the Jin by invading northern China. By 1213, he had controlled most of Jin territory north of the Yellow River with the exception of the capital Zhongdu. In March 1214, he set up headquarters in Zhongdu's northern suburbs and with brother Hasar and three eldest sons, Jochi, Chagatai and Ögedei, began to besiege the city. Though the Jin court was weakened by a palace coup, the city was protected by three layers of moats and 900 towers. When disease broke out within the Mongol ranks, Genghis Khan sent Muslim envoy Ja'far into the city to negotiate, and the Jin court agreed to a peace treaty by ceding territory and accepting vassal status. Among Genghis Khan's demands was marriage to a Jurchen princess. The Qicheng Princess, daughter of Wanyan Yongji, was designated for the Mongol chieftain. She along with 100 guards, 500 boys and girl servants, 3,000 bolts of cloth, and 3,000 horses were sent to the Mongol camp. The Qicheng Princess became one of the four main wives of Genghis Khan, who lifted the siege and withdrew north of the Juyong Pass.
Emperor Xuanzong, after considerable debate, decided to move the capital from Zhongdu to Kaifeng further to the south. In June 1214, as the Jin imperial procession departed the city, a detachment of Khitan guards rebelled at the Lugou Bridge and defected to the Mongols. Genghis Khan believed the Jin was trying to rebuild military strength further south in breach of the terms of peace and decided to reinvade the Jin. By winter, Mongol troops were again besieging Zhongdu.
In 1215, after a bitter siege in which many of the city's inhabitants starved, Zhongdu's 100,000 defenders and 108,000 households surrendered. The city was still looted and burned by the invaders. Zhongdu was renamed Yanjing and its population shrank to 91,000 in 1216 (with 285,000 in the surrounding region). Among the captives taken from the city was a Khitan named Yelü Chucai, who persuaded Genghis Khan that while China could be conquered from the saddle, it could not be ruled from the saddle. Rather than converting northern China into pastures, it would be more beneficial for Mongols to tax the agrarian population. Genghis Khan heeded the advice and the Mongol pillaging eased. The Mongols continued to the war against the Jurchens until the capture of Kaifeng in 1234 ended the Jin dynasty. Yelü Chucai was buried on the east bank of Kunming Lake in what is now the Summer Palace.
In 1219, Genghis Khan invited the Daoist sage Qiu Chuji for advice on "keeping the empire in good order." The 76-year old Qiu had previously declined invitations from the emperors of the Jin and Southern Song, but agreed to travel from Shandong to Yanjing and then to Central Asia, where, at the Mongol encampment in the Hindu Kush, he taught the Genghis Khan about the "Dao", telling the great khan medicine for immortality did not exist and urged him to preserve lives. The Mongol leader called Qiu an immortal sage, made him the head Daoist priest of the empire and exempted Daoism from taxation. Qiu returned to Yanjing in 1224 and expanded what would become the White Cloud Temple, where he is buried and which is today the seat of the Chinese Daoist Association.
Yuan dynasty.
When Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, visited Yanjing in 1261, much of the city lay in ruin, so he stayed in the Daning Palace on Qionghua Island. Unlike other Mongol leaders who wanted to retain the traditional tribal confederation based in Karakorum in Outer Mongolia, Kublai Khan was eager to become the emperor of a cosmopolitan empire. He spent the next four years waging and winning a civil war against rival Mongol chieftains and in 1264 ordered advisor Liu Bingzhong to build his new capital at Yanjing. In 1260, he had already begun construction of his capital at Xanadu, some due north of Beijing on the Luan River in present-day Inner Mongolia, but he preferred the location of Beijing. With the North China Plain opening to the south and the steppes just beyond the mountain passes to the north, Beijing was an ideal midway point for Kublai Khan's new seat of power.
In 1271, he declared the creation of the Yuan dynasty and named his capital Dadu (, Chinese for "Grand Capital", or "Daidu" to the Mongols). It is also known by the Mongol name Khanbaliq (), spelled "Cambuluc" in Marco Polo's account. Construction of Dadu began in 1267 and the first palace was finished the next year. The entire palace complex was completed in 1274 and the rest of the city by 1285. In 1279, when Mongol armies finished off the last of the Song dynasty in southern China, Beijing became for the first time, the capital of the whole of China. After the construction of Dadu, Xanadu, also known as Shangdu, became Kublai Khan's summer capital.
Rather than continuing on the foundation of Zhongdu, the new capital Dadu was shifted to the northeast and built around the old Daning Palace on Qionghua Island in the middle of the Taiye Lake. This move set in place Beijing's current north–south central axis. Dadu was nearly twice the size of Zhongdu. It stretched from present-day Chang'an Avenue in the south to the earthen Dadu city walls that still stand in northern and northeastern Beijing, between the northern 3rd and 4th Ring Roads. The city had earthen walls 24 m thick and 11 city gates, two in the north and three each in the other cardinal directions. Later, the Ming dynasty lined portions of Dadu's eastern and western walls with brick and retained four of the gates. Thus, Dadu had the same width as the Beijing of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The geographic center of the Dadu was marked with a pavilion, which is now the Drum Tower.
The most striking physical feature of Dadu was the string of lakes in the heart of the city. These lakes were created from the Jinshui River inside the city. They are now known as the six seas ("hai") of central Beijing: Houhai, Qianhai, and Xihai (the Rear, Front, and Western Seas) which are collectively known as Shichahai; Beihai (the North Sea); and Zhonghai and Nanhai which are collectively known as Zhongnanhai. Qionghua Island is now the island in Beihai Park on which the White Dagoba stands. Like today's Chinese leaders, the Yuan imperial family lived west of the lakes in the Xingsheng (兴圣宫) and Longfu (隆福宫) Palaces. A third palace east of the lakes, called the Danei (大内), at the site of the later Forbidden City, housed the imperial offices. The city's construction drew builders from all over the Mongols' Asian empire, including local Chinese as well as those from places such as Nepal and Central Asia. Liu Bingzhong was appointed as the supervisor of the construction of the imperial city and a chief architect was Yeheidie'erding. The pavilions of the palaces took on various architectural styles from across the empire. The entire palace complex occupied the south central portion of Dadu. Following Chinese tradition, the temples for ancestral rites and harvest rites were built, respectively, to west and east of the palace.
The inclusion of the Jinshui and Gaoliang rivers gave Dadu a larger supply of water than the Lotus Pool which had nourished Ji, Youzhou, and Nanjing for the previous 2,000 years. To boost water supply even more, Yuan hydrologist Guo Shoujing built channels to draw additional spring water from Yuquan Mountain in the northwest through what is today the Kunming Lake of the Summer Palace through the Purple Bamboo Park to Jishuitan, which was a large reservoir inside Dadu. The expansion and extension of the Grand Canal from Dadu to Hangzhou enabled the city to import greater volumes of grain to sustain a larger population. The completion of the Tonghui Canal in 1293 allowed barges from Tongzhou to sail through the city right to the gates of the imperial palace at Shichahai. In 1270, Dadu had a population of 418,000 and another 635,000 in the surrounding region. By 1327, the city had 952,000 residents with another 2.08 million in the surrounding region.
The city's residential districts were laid out in a checkerboard pattern divided by avenues 25 m in width and narrow alleyways, called "hutongs", 6–7 m wide. One of the best surviving examples of such a district is Dongsi Subdistrict, which has 14 parallel hutongs, called the 14 "tiao" of Dongsi. The name "hutong" is unique to the Yuan-era city; in older neighborhoods that date to the Liao and Jin eras, narrow lanes are called "jie" or streets. Each of the large avenues had underground sewers which carried rain and refuse to the south of the city. The main markets were located in Dongsi, Xisi and along the north shore of Jishuitan.
As Kublai Khan had intended, the city was a showcase of the cosmopolitan Yuan Empire. A number of foreign travelers including Giovanni di Monte Corvino, Odoric of Pordenone, Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta left written accounts of visits to the city. Some of the most famous writers of the Yuan era including Ma Zhiyuan, Guan Hanqing and Wang Shifu, lived in Dadu. The Mongols commissioned the building of an Islamic observatory and Islamic academy. The White Stupa Temple near Fuchengmen was commissioned by Kublai Khan in 1271. Its famous white stupa was designed by Nepali architect Araniko, and remains one of the biggest stupas in China. The Confucius Temple and Guozijian (Imperial Academy) were founded during the reign of Temür Khan, Emperor Chengzong, Kublai's successor.
Yuan rule was severely weakened by a succession struggle in 1328 known as the War of the Two Capitals in which the Dadu-based claimant to the throne prevailed over his Shangdu-based rival, but not after heavy fighting around Dadu and across the country among Mongol princes.
Ming dynasty.
In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang founded the Ming dynasty in the Nanjing on the Yangtze River and his general Xu Da drove north and captured Dadu. The last Yuan emperor fled to the steppes. Dadu's imperial palace was razed and the city was renamed Beiping (北平 or "Northern Peace"). Nanjing, also known as "Yingtian Fu" became the "Jingshi" or the capital of the new dynasty. Two years later, Zhu Yuanzhang conferred Beiping to his fourth son, Zhu Di, who at the age of ten became the Prince of Yan. Zhu Di did not move to Beiping until 1380 but quickly built up his military power in defense of the northern frontier. His three older brothers all predeceased his father who died in 1398. The throne was passed on to Zhu Yunwen, the son of Zhu Di's oldest brother. The new emperor sought to curtail his uncle's power in Beiping, and a bitter power struggle ensued. In 1402, after a four-year civil war, Zhu Di seized Nanjing and declared himself the Yongle Emperor. As the third emperor of the Ming dynasty, he was not content to stay in Nanjing. He executed hundreds in Nanjing for remaining loyal to his predecessor, who was reportedly killed in a palace fire but was rumored to have escaped. The Yongle Emperor sent his eunuch Zheng He on the famed voyages overseas in part to investigate the rumors of the Jianwen Emperor abroad.
In 1403, the Yongle Emperor renamed his home base Beijing (北京, the "Northern Capital"), and elevated the city to the status of capital, on par with Nanjing. For the first time, Beijing took on its modern name, while the prefecture around the city gained the new name Shuntian Fu (顺天府). From 1403 to 1420, Yongle prepared his new capital with a massive reconstruction program. Some of Beijing's most iconic historical buildings, including the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, were built for Yongle's capital. The Temples of the Sun, Earth and Moon were later added by the Daoist Jiajing Emperor in 1530.
In 1421, Yongle moved the "Jingshi" of the Ming to Beijing, which made Beijing the main capital of the Ming dynasty. From Beijing, Yongle launched multiple campaigns against the Mongols. After he died in 1424, his son, the Hongxi Emperor, ordered the capital be moved back to Nanjing, but died of illness in 1425. The Hongxi Emperor sent his son, the future Xuande Emperor, to Nanjing to prepare for the move, but the latter chose to keep the capital in Beijing after his accession to the throne. Like his grandfather, the Xuande Emperor was interested in monitoring affairs on the northern frontier. Most of the Great Wall in northern Beijing Municipality were built during the Ming dynasty.
In the early Ming dynasty, the northern part of old Dadu was depopulated and abandoned. In 1369, the city's population had been reduced to 95,000, with only 113,000 in the surrounding region. A new northern wall was built to the south of the old wall, leaving the Jishuitan reservoir outside the city as part of the northern moat. A new southern wall for the city was built half a kilometer south of the southern Dadu wall. These changes completed the Inner City wall of Beijing, which had nine gates (three in the south and two each to the north, east and west).
The Inner City walls withstood a major test following the Tumu Crisis of 1449 when the Zhengtong Emperor was captured by Oirat Mongols during a military campaign near Huailai. The Oirat chieftain, Esen Tayisi, then drove through the Great Wall and marched on the Ming capital with the captive emperor in hand. Defense Minister Yu Qian rejected Esen's demands for ransom despite the Zhengtong Emperor's pleadings. Yu said the responsibility to protect the country took precedence over the Emperor's life. He rejected calls by other officials to move the capital to the South and instead elevated the Zhengtong Emperor's younger half-brother to the throne and assembled 220,000 troops to defend the city. Ming forces with firearms and cannons ambushed the Mongol cavalry outside Deshengmen, killing Esen's brother in the barrage, and repelled another attack on Xizhimen. Esen retreated to Mongolia and three years later, returned the captive Zhengtong Emperor with no ransom paid. In 1457, the Zhengtong Emperor reclaimed the throne and had Yu Qian executed for treason. Yu Qian's home near Dongdan was later made into a temple in his honor.
Back in power, the Zhengtong Emperor, now ruling under the new era name of Tianshun, first promoted and then became distrustful of officials who had aided his restoration. One of them, the grand eunuch Cao Jixiang, decided to strike at the throne. In August 1461, Cao's adopted son, Cao Qin, launched a mutiny among ethnic Mongol troops stationed inside Beijing. The plot was betrayed and the Tianshun Emperor ordered the gates of the Forbidden City and the Inner City closed, trapping the mutineers, who were unable to break into the palace complex and were killed.
In 1550, Altan Khan led a Khalkha Mongol raid on Beijing that pillaged the northern suburbs but did not attempt to take the city. To protect the city's southern suburbs, including neighborhoods from the Liao and Jin-eras and the Temple of Heaven, the Outer City wall was built in 1553. The Outer City wall had seven gates, three to the south, two each to the east and west. The Inner and Outer Ming city walls stood until in the 1960s when all but a couple small sections were pulled down to build the Beijing Subway and the 2nd Ring Road. The largest and best-preserved section of the wall is located in the Ming City Wall Relics Park near the southeast corner of the inner city.
Jesuit missions reached Beijing at the turn of the 16th century. In 1601, Matteo Ricci became an advisor to the imperial court of the Wanli Emperor and became the first Westerner to have access to the Forbidden City. He established the Nantang Cathedral in 1605, the oldest surviving Catholic church in the city. Other Jesuits later became directors of Beijing's Imperial Observatory.
On the eve of the Tumu Crisis in 1448, the city had 960,000 residents with another 2.19 million living in the surrounding region. Beijing was the largest city in the world from 1425 to 1635 and from 1710 to 1825. To feed the growing population, Ming authorities built and administered granaries, including the Imperial Granary and Jingtong storehouses near the terminus of the Grand Canal, which fed a growing population and sustained the military. The granaries helped control prices and prevent inflation, but price controls became less effective as the population grew and demand for food exceeded supply.
Until the mid-15th century, Beijing residents relied on wood for heating and cooking. The growing population led to massive logging of the forests around the city. By the mid-15th century, the forests had largely disappeared. As a substitute, residents turned to coal, which was first mined in the Western Hills during the Yuan dynasty and expanded in the Ming. The use of coal caused many environmental problems and changed the ecological system around the city.
During the Ming dynasty, 15 epidemic outbreaks occurred in the city of Beijing including smallpox, "pimple plague" and "vomit blood plague" - the latter two were possibly bubonic plague and pneumonic plague. In most cases, the public health system functioned well in gaining control of the outbreaks, except in 1643. That year, epidemics claimed 200,000 lives in Beijing, thus compromising the defense of the city from the attacks of the peasant rebels and contributing to the downfall of the dynasty.
During the 15th and 16th centuries, banditry was common near Beijing despite the presence of imperial government. Due to inadequate supervision and economic privation, imperial troops in the capital region to protect the throne would often turn to brigandage. Officials responsible for eradicating banditry often had ties to brigands and other marginal elements of Ming society.
During the late Ming dynasty, Beijing faced threats from both within and beyond the Great Wall. In 1629, the Manchus, who were descendants of the Jurchens, raided Beijing from the Manchuria, but were defeated outside the outer city walls at Guangqumen and Zuoanmen by Ming commander Yuan Chonghuan. After retreating north, Manchu leader, Hong Taiji, through treachery, deceived the Ming dynasty's Chongzhen Emperor into believing that Yuan Chonghuan had actually betrayed the Ming. In 1630, the Chongzhen Emperor had Yuan executed in public at Caishikou through death by a thousand cuts. Yuan was rehabilitated 150 years later by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty and his tomb near Guangqumen is now a shrine.
Also in 1629, Li Zicheng launched a peasant rebellion in northwest China and, after 15 years of conquest, captured Beijing in March 1644. The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree in Jingshan. Li proclaimed himself emperor of the Shun dynasty, but he was defeated at Shanhaiguan by Ming general Wu Sangui and the Manchu Prince Dorgon. Wu had defected to the Manchus and allowed them inside the Great Wall. They drove Li Zicheng from Beijing in late April.
Qing dynasty.
On May 3, 1644, the Manchus seized Beijing in the name of freeing the city from the rebel forces of Li Zicheng. Dorgon held a state funeral for the Chongzhen Emperor of the Ming dynasty and reappointed many Ming officials. In October, he moved the child Shunzhi Emperor from the old capital Shenyang into the Forbidden City and made Beijing the new seat of the Qing dynasty. In the following decades, the Manchus would conquer the rest of the country and ruled China for nearly three centuries from the city. During this era, Beijing was also known as Jingshi which corresponds with the Manchu name Gemun Hecen. The city's population, which had fallen to 144,000 in 1644, rebounded to 539,000 in 1647 (the population of the surrounding area rose from 554,000 to 1.3 million).
The Qing largely retained the physical configuration of Beijing inside the city walls. Each of the Eight Banners, including the Manchu, Mongol, and Han Banners were assigned to guard and live near the eight gates of the Inner City. Outside the city, the Qing court seized large tracts of land for Manchu noble estates. Northwest of the city, Qing emperors built several large palatial gardens. In 1684, the Kangxi Emperor built the Changchun Garden on the site of the Ming dynasty's Qinghua (or Tsinghua) Garden (outside today's west gate of Peking University). In the early 18th century, he began building the Yuanmingyuan, also known as the "Old Summer Palace", which the Qianlong Emperor expanded with European Baroque-style garden pavilions. In 1750, the Qianlong Emperor built the Yiheyuan, commonly referred to as the "Summer Palace". The two summer palaces represent both the culmination of Qing imperial splendor and its decline. Both were ransacked and razed by invading Western powers in the late Qing dynasty.
The Beijing dialect eventually became the official national language for the country. In the early Qing dynasty, Han officials serving in the imperial court were required to learn the Manchu language, but most Manchus eventually learned to speak Chinese. The Manchus adopted Beijing Mandarin as their spoken language and this was a feature of Manchu Banner garrisons in areas of southern China. In 1728, the Yongzheng Emperor, who could not understand officials from southern China, decreed that all takers of the civil service examination must be able to speak Beijing Mandarin. Though the decree was eventually lifted under the Jiaqing Emperor, the Beijing dialect spread first among officials and then among commoners under subsequent regimes. Shortly after the founding of the Republic of China, the Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation made the Beijing dialect the national standard for spoken Chinese in 1913. After the capital was moved to Nanjing, National Languages Committee reaffirmed the Beijing dialect as the standard in 1932. The People's Republic of China followed suit in 1955.
The Qing dynasty maintained a relatively stable supply of food for the population of the capital during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The government's grain tribute system brought food from the provinces and kept grain prices stable. Soup kitchens provided relief to the needy. The secure food supply helped the Qing court maintain a degree of political stability. Temple fairs such as the Huguo Fair, which are like monthly bazaars held around temples, added to the commercial vibrance of the city. At the height of the Qianlong Emperor's reign in 1781, the city had a population of 776,242 (and another 2.18 million in the surrounding region). Thereafter, Qing authorities began to restrict inward migration to the city. A century later, the census of 1881–82 showed similar figures of 776,111 and 2.45 million.
In 1790, the Qing court's Nanfu office, which was in charge of organizing entertainment for the emperor, invited the dramatic opera troupes from Anhui to perform for the Qianlong Emperor. Under the Qianlong Emperor, the Nanfu had up to a thousand employees, including actors, musicians, and court eunuchs. In 1827, the Daoguang Emperor, the Qianlong Emperor's grandson, changed the name from Nanfu to Shengpingshu, and reduced the number of performances. Nevertheless, the court invited opera troupes from Hubei came to perform. The Anhui and Hubei operatic styles eventually blended together in the mid-19th century to form Peking Opera.
Most of Beijing's oldest business establishments date to the Qing era. Tongrentang, opened in 1669 by a royal physician, became the sole supplier of herbal medicine to the Qing court in 1723. Baikui Laohao, the Hui Muslim restaurant serving traditional Beijing cuisine, opened its first store next to the Longfu Temple in 1780. Roast duck was part of the imperial menu dating back to the Yuan dynasty and restaurants serving "Anas peking" to the public opened in the 15th century, but it was Quanjude, which opened in 1864 and introduced the "hung oven", that made Peking Duck world-famous.
In 1813, some 200 adherents of the White Lotus sect launched a surprise siege on the Forbidden City but were repelled. In response, authorities imposed the baojia system of social surveillance and control.
The British diplomat Lord Macartney's mission to China arrived in Beijing in 1792, but failed to persuade the Qianlong Emperor to ease trade restrictions or to permit a permanent British Embassy in the city. Nevertheless, Macartney observed weaknesses within the Qing regime, which would influence future Sino-British conflicts.
In 1860, during the Second Opium War, Anglo-French expeditionary forces defeated a Qing army at Baliqiao east of Beijing. They captured the city and sacked the Summer Palace and Old Summer Palace. Lord Elgin, the commander of the expedition, ordered the burning of the Old Summer Palace in retaliation of Qing mistreatment of Western prisoners. He spared the Forbidden City, saving it as a venue for the treaty-signing ceremony. Under the Convention of Peking that ended the war, the Qing government was forced to allow Western powers to establish permanent diplomatic presence in the city. The foreign embassies were based southeast of the Forbidden City in the Beijing Legation Quarter.
In 1886, Empress Dowager Cixi had the Summer Palace rebuilt using funds originally designated for the imperial navy, the Beiyang Fleet. After the Qing government was defeated by Japan in the First Sino-Japanese War and forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Shimonoseki, Kang Youwei assembled 1,300 scholars outside Xuanwumen to protest the treaty and drafted a 10,000-character appeal to the Guangxu Emperor. In June 1898, the Guangxu Emperor adopted the proposals of Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao and other scholars and launched the Hundred Days' Reform. The reforms alarmed Empress Dowager Cixi, who, with the help of Ronglu and Beiyang military commander Yuan Shikai, launched a coup. The Guangxu Emperor was imprisoned, Kang and Liang fled abroad, and Tan Sitong and five other scholar reformers were publicly beheaded at Caishikou outside Xuanwumen. One legacy of the short-lived reform era was the founding of Peking University in 1898. The university would have a profound impact on the intellectual and political history of the city.
In 1898, a millenarian group called the Righteous Harmony Society Movement formed in Shandong Province, calling for the expulsion of all foreign influence in China. They attacked Westerners especially missionaries and converted Chinese, and were called the "Boxers" by Westerners. The Qing court initially suppressed the Boxers but the Empress Dowager attempted to use them to curtail foreign influence and permitted them to gather in Beijing, then expelled the Boxers from the city after ransacking occurred and ordered the foreigners in the legations to leave to Tianjin, which they refused to do. In June 1900, the Qing forces including Manchu Bannerman and Muslim fighters from Gansu and the Boxers besieged the Legation Quarter, which sheltered several hundred foreign civilians and soldiers and about 3,200 Chinese Christians. The first attempt by the foreign Eight-Nation Alliance in the Seymour Expedition was defeated and forces to turn back. On the second attempt, eventually they defeated the Boxers and Qing troops and lifted the siege. The foreign armies looted the city and occupied Beijing and the surrounding area in Zhili. Empress Dowager Cixi fled to Xi'an and did not return until after the Qing government had signed the Boxer Protocol which compelled it to pay reparations of 450 million taels of silver with interest at four percent. The Boxer indemnities stripped the Qing government of much of its tax revenues and further weakened the state.
The United States used its portion of the proceeds to fund scholarships for Chinese students studying in America. In 1911, the Boxer Indemnity Scholar Program established the American Indemnity College in the Qinghua Gardens northwest of Beijing as a preparatory school for students planning to study abroad. In 1912, the school was renamed Tsinghua University, and remains to this day, one of the finest institutions of higher learning in China.
After the Boxer Rebellion, the struggling Qing dynasty accelerated the pace of reform and became more receptive to foreign influence. The centuries-old imperial civil service examination was abolished in 1905, and replaced with a Western-style curriculum and degree system. Public education for women received greater emphasis and even drew support from reactionaries like the Empress Dowager. Beijing's school for girls in the late Qing period made unbound feet an entrance requirement. The Beijing Police Academy, founded in 1901 as China's first modern institution for police training, used Japanese instructors and became a model for police academies in other cities. The Peking Union Medical College, founded by missionaries in 1906 and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation from 1915, set the standard for the training of nurses. The Metropolitan University Library in Beijing, founded in 1898, was China's first modern academic library devoted to serving public higher education.
Also in 1905, the Board of Revenue and private investors founded the Hubu Bank, China's first central bank and largest modern bank. This bank was renamed the Bank of China after the Xinhai Revolution and began Beijing's tradition as the center of state banks in China. Large foreign banks including the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. (HSBC), National City Bank (Citibank), Deutsch-Asiatische Bank and Yokohama Specie Bank opened branches in the Legation Quarter. The building of railroads was capital intensive and required large-scale financing and foreign expertise. Beijing's earliest railroads were designed, financed and built under the supervision of foreign concerns.
The first railway in China was built in Beijing in 1864 by a British merchant to demonstrate the technology to the imperial court. About 600 meters of tracks were laid outside Xuanwumen. The steam locomotive shook the neighborhood and alarmed the capital guards. The Qing court looked on the strange contraption with disfavor and had the railway dismantled. To secure the support of Empress Dowager Cixi for railway construction, Viceroy Li Hongzhang imported a small train set from Germany and in 1888 built a 2-km narrow gauge railway from her residence in Zhongnanhai to her dining hall in Beihai. The Empress, concerned that the locomotive's noise would disturb the geomancy or "fengshui" of the imperial city, required the train be pulled by eunuchs instead of steam engine.
The city's first commercial railway, Tianjin-Lugouqiao Railway, was built from 1895 to 1897 with British financing. It ran from the Marco Polo Bridge to Tianjin. The rail terminus was extended closer to the city to Fengtai and then to Majiapu, just outside Yongdingmen, a gate of the Outer City wall. The Qing court resisted the extension of railways inside city walls. Foreign powers who seized the city during the Boxer Rebellion extended the railway inside the outer city wall to Yongdingmen in 1900 and then further north to Zhengyangmen (Qianmen) just outside the Inner City wall in 1903. They built an eastern spur to Tongzhou to carry grain shipped from the south on the Grand Canal. This extension breached the city wall at Dongbianmen. The Lugouqiao-Hankou Railway, financed by French-Belgian capital and built from 1896 to 1905, was renamed Beijing-Hankou Railway after it was routed to Qianmen from the west. This required the partial demotion of the Xuanwumen barbican. The completion of the Beijing–Fengtian Railway in 1907 required a similar break in Chongwenmen's fortification. Thus, began the tearing down of city gates and walls to make way for rail transportation. The first railway in China built without foreign assistance was the Imperial Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway. Built from 1905 to 1909, it was designed by Zhan Tianyou and terminated just outside Xizhimen. By the late Qing dynasty, Beijing had rail connections to Hankou (Wuhan), Pukou (Nanjing), Fengtian (Shenyang) and Datong, and was a major railway hub in North China.
Republic of China.
The Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 but the capital of the newly founded Republic of China remained in Beijing as former Qing general Yuan Shikai took control of the new government from revolutionaries in the south. Yuan and successors from his Beiyang Army ruled the Republic from Beijing until 1928 when Chinese Nationalists reunified the country through the Northern Expedition and moved the capital to Nanjing. Beijing was renamed Beiping. In 1937, a clash between Chinese and Japanese troops at the Marco Polo Bridge outside Beiping triggered the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Japanese occupiers created a collaborationist government in northern China and reverted the city's name to Beijing to serve as capital for the puppet regime. After Japan's surrender in 1945, the city returned to Chinese rule and was again renamed Beiping. During the subsequent civil war between the Chinese Nationalists and Communists, the city was peacefully transferred to Communist control in 1949 and renamed Beijing to become the capital of the People's Republic of China.
Xinhai Revolution.
When the Wuchang Uprising erupted in October 1911, the Qing court summoned Yuan Shikai and his powerful Beiyang Army to suppress the insurrection. As he fought revolutionaries in the south, Yuan also negotiated with them. On January 1, 1912, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who returned from exile, founded the Republic of China in Nanjing and was elected provisional president. The new government was not recognized by any foreign powers, and Sun agreed to cede leadership to Yuan Shikai in exchange for the latter's assistance in ending the Qing dynasty. On February 12, Yuan compelled the Qing court, under the regency of Prince Chun, to abdicate. Empress Dowager Longyu signed the abdication agreement on behalf of the five-year-old Last Emperor, Puyi. The following day Sun resigned from the provisional presidency and recommended Yuan for the position. Under the terms of the imperial abdication, the Puyi would retain his dignitary title and staff and receive an annual stipend of 4 million Mexican silver dollars from the Republic. He was permitted to continue to reside in the Forbidden City for a time but was required to eventually move to the Summer Palace. His tomb and rituals were to be maintained at the expense of the Republic. The abdication ended the Qing dynasty and averted further bloodshed in the revolution.
As a condition for ceding leadership to Yuan, Sun insisted that the provisional government remain in Nanjing. On February 14, the Provisional Senate initially voted 20–5 in favor of making Beijing the capital over Nanjing, with two votes going for Wuhan and one for Tianjin. The Senate majority wanted to secure the peace agreement by taking power in Beijing. Zhang Jian and others reasoned that having the capital in Beijing would check against Manchu restoration and Mongol secession. But Sun and Huang Xing argued in favor of Nanjing to balance against Yuan's power base in the north. Li Yuanhong presented Wuhan as a compromise. The next day, the Provisional Senate voted again, this time, 19–6 in favor of Nanjing with two votes for Wuhan. Sun sent a delegation led by Cai Yuanpei and Wang Jingwei to persuade Yuan to move to Nanjing. Yuan welcomed the delegation and agreed to accompany the delegates back to the south. Then on the evening of February 29, riots and fires broke out in all over the city. They were allegedly started by disobedient troops of Cao Kun, a loyal officer of Yuan. Disorder among military ranks spread to Tongzhou, Tianjin and Baoding. These events gave Yuan the pretext to stay in the north to guard against unrest. On March 10, Yuan was inaugurated in Beijing as the provisional president of the Republic of China. Yuan based the executive office and residence in Zhongnanhai, next to the Forbidden City. On April 5, the Provisional Senate in Nanjing voted to make Beijing the capital of the Republic and convened in Beijing at the end of the month.
In August, Sun Yat-sen traveled to Beijing where he was welcomed by Yuan Shikai and a crowd of thousands. At the Huguang Guild Hall, the Revolutionary Alliance ("Tongmenghui") led by Sun, Huang Xing and Song Jiaoren joined several smaller parties to form the Kuomintang. The first national assembly elections were held from December 1912 to January 1913. Adult males over the age of 21 who were educated or owned property and paid taxes and who could prove two-year residency in a particular county could vote. An estimated 4–6% of China's population were registered for the election. The Nationalist Party won a majority in both houses of the National Assembly, which convened in Beijing in April 1913.
As the assembly set out to ratify the constitution, Yuan resisted efforts to share power. Without the assembly's knowledge, he arranged for the large and expensive Reorganization Loan from a consortium of foreign lenders to fund his military. The loan, signed into effect at the HSBC Bank in the Legation Quarter, effectively surrendered the government's collection of salt tax revenues to foreign control. Yuan's agents assassinated Nationalist leader Song Jiaoren in Shanghai. In response, Sun Yat-sen launched a Second Revolution in July 1913, which failed and forced him into exile. Yuan then forced the National Assembly to elect him as the president and expel Nationalist members. In early 1914, he dissolved the National Assembly and abolished the provisional constitution in May. On December 23, 1915, Yuan declared himself emperor, and his regime, the Empire of China (1915–1916). This declaration provoked the National Protection War as provinces in the south rebelled. Yuan was forced to step down from emperor to president in March 1916. He died in Beijing in June 1916, leaving military men from the Beiyang Army vying for control of the government. Over the next 12 years, the Beiyang Government in Beijing had no fewer than eight presidents, five parliaments, 24 cabinets, at least four constitutions and one brief restoration of the Manchu Monarchy.
Unlike prior dynastic changes, the end of Qing rule in Beijing did not cause a substantial decline in the city's population, which was 785,442 in 1910, 670,000 in 1913 and 811,566 in 1917. The population of the surrounding region grew from 1.7 to 2.9 million over the same period. In 1917, Beijing was the fourth largest city in China after Guangzhou, Shanghai and Hankou, and the seventh largest capital city in the world.
World War I and the May 4th Movement.
After Yuan's death, Li Yuanhong became president and Duan Qirui, the prime minister, and the National Assembly was reconvened. The government soon faced a crisis over whether to enter World War I on the side of the Allied Powers or remain neutral. Li dismissed Duan, who favored entry into the war, and invited warlord Zhang Xun to the capital to mediate. Zhang and his pigtailed loyalist army marched into Beijing, dissolved the National Assembly and restored Puyi as Qing emperor on July 1. Li fled to the Japanese Embassy in the Legation. The imperial restoration lasted just 12 days as Duan Qirui's army reclaimed the capital, and sent Zhang seeking refuge in the Dutch Embassy. Under Duan's command, China declared war on the Central Powers and sent 140,000 Chinese laborers to work on the Western Front. With financial backing from Japan, Duan then engineered the election of a new parliament in 1918 that was stacked his supporters from the Anhui clique. The so-called Anfu Parliament was named after Anfu Hutong, near Zhongnanhai where Duan's Anhui-based supporters congregated.
In the spring of 1919, the Republic of China, as a victor nation sent a delegation to the Paris Peace Conference seeking the return of German concession in Shandong Province to China. Instead, the Treaty of Versailles gave those possessions to Japan. News of the treaty sparked outrage in the Chinese capital. On May 4, 3,000 students from 13 universities in Beijing gathered in Tiananmen Square to protest the betrayal of China by the other Western powers and the corruption of the Anfu government by Japanese financial support. They marched toward the foreign legation but were blocked and proceeded to the home of deputy foreign minister Cao Rulin, who had attended the Peace Conference and was known to be friendly to Japanese interests. They razed Cao's residence and beat up Zhang Zongxiang, another pro-Japanese diplomat. The police arrested 32 students, which provoked further protests and arrests. Within weeks, the movement had spread to 200 cities and towns in 22 provinces. Workers in Shanghai struck and merchants closed shops in support of the protests. By late June, the government pledged not to sign the treaty, removed Cao and Zhang from office and released students from jail.
The May Fourth Movement began a tradition of student activism in Beijing and had a profound political and cultural impact on modern China. Leading intellectuals including Cai Yuanpei and Hu Shih at Peking University, encouraged the development of new culture to replace the traditional order. The movement also heightened the appeal of Marxism-Leninism as Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao, prominent May 4 figures, became early leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. Among the many youth who flocked to the Chinese capital during this period was a student from Hunan named Mao Zedong who worked as a library assistant under Li Dazhao at Peking University. Mao left the city for Shanghai in 1920 where he helped found the Chinese Communist Party in 1921. He did not return to Beijing until almost 30 years later.
Beiyang regime.
In the 1920s, military strongmen of the Beiyang Army split into cliques and vied for control of the Republican government and its capital. In July 1920, Duan's government, weakened by the May 4 Protests, was driven out of Beijing by Wu Peifu and Cao Kun of the Zhili clique in the Zhili–Anhui War. Two years later, the Zhili Clique fought off a challenge by Zhang Zuolin and his Manchuria-based Fengtian clique in the First Zhili–Fengtian War. When the two sides squared off again in Second Zhili–Fengtian War in 1924, one of Wu's officers Feng Yuxiang launched the Beijing Coup. On October 23, 1924, Feng seized the capital, imprisoned President Cao Kun, restored Duan Qirui as the head of state and invited Sun Yat-sen to Beijing for peace talks. At that time, Sun was building a Nationalist regime in Guangzhou with the assistance of the Soviet Comintern and support of the Chinese Communist Party. Sun was stricken with cancer when he arrived in Beijing in early 1925 for one last effort to heal the north–south divide. He was welcomed by hundreds of civic organizations and called on Duan to include broad segments of civil society in reconstructing a united government. He died in Beijing on March 12, 1925, and was entombed at the Temple of Azure Clouds.
Zhang Zuolin and Wu Peifu joined forces against Feng Yuxiang, who relied on support from the Soviet Union. Feng took a generally accommodating stance toward the Nationalist and Communist parties which were active in spreading influence in the city. During this period, Beijing was a hotbed of student activism. In the May 30th Movement of 1925, 12,000 students from 90 schools marched through Wangfujing to Tiananmen in support of protesters in Shanghai. With the opening of private colleges such as Yenching University in 1919 and the Catholic University of Peking in 1925, the student population in Beijing grew substantially in the early 1920s. Middle school students also joined the protests. In October, students protested against imperialism during an international conference on customs and tariffs held in the city. In November, Li Dazhao organized the "Capital Revolution" a protest by students and workers demanding Duan's resignation. The protest was more violent, burning down a major newspaper office, but was disbanded.
Though the Nationalists, under Sun's leadership, had allied with the Communists in the struggle against warlords, this alliance was not without tension. In November 1925, a group of right-wing Nationalist leaders met in the Western Hills and called for the expulsion of Communists from the Nationalist Party and severance of ties with the Comintern including advisor Mikhail Borodin. This manifesto was denounced by the Nationalists' party center in Guangzhou led by Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and Hu Hanmin, and members of the so-called "Western Hills Group" were either expelled or left out of the party leadership. They moved to Shanghai and regained power during the rupture between the Nationalists and Communists in April 1927.
On March 17, 1926, Feng Yuxiang's "Guominjun" troops at Dagu Fort near Tianjin exchanged fire with Japanese warships carrying Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian troops. Japan accused the Chinese government of violating the Boxer Protocol and, with the other seven Boxer Powers, issued an ultimatum demanding the removal of all defenses between Beijing and the sea as set forth under the Protocols. The ultimatum provoked student protests in Beijing that were jointly organized by the left-wing Nationalists and Communists. Two thousand students marched on Duan Qirui's executive office and called for the abrogation of the unequal treaties. Police opened fire and killed over 50 and wounded 200 in what became known as the March 18 Massacre. The government issued warrants for the arrest of Nationalists and Communists including Li Dazhao, who fled to the Soviet Embassy in the Legation quarters. Within weeks, Feng Yuxiang was defeated by Zhang Zuolin and Duan's government fell. After Zhang took power on May 1, 1926, both the Nationalists and Communists were driven underground. A year later, Zhang Zuolin raided the Soviet Embassy in the Legation and seized Li Dazhao. Li and 19 others Communist and Nationalist activists were executed in Beijing on April 25, 1927.
Zhang Zuolin controlled the Beiyang Government until June 1928 when the Nationalists on the Northern Expedition led by Chiang Kai-shek and allies Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang jointly advanced on Beijing. Zhang left the city for Manchuria and was assassinated en route by the Japanese Kwantung Army. Beijing was handed over peacefully to the victorious Nationalists who moved the capital and Sun Yat-sen's tomb to Nanjing. For the first time since 1421, Beijing was renamed Beiping 北平 (Wade–Giles: Peip'ing), or "Northern Peace". Following the Northern Expedition, Beijing was under the "de facto" control of Shanxi warlord Yan Xishan who had allied himself with Nationalists. On 2 March 1929, the city was the place of a violent mutiny of soldiers who formerly belonged to the army of warlord Zhang Zongchang, a subordinate of Zhang Zuolin. Though the mutineers managed to seize the Yonghe Temple and spread terror in Beijing, their revolt was quickly suppressed. The city was made the provincial capital of Hebei Province, but lost that status to Tianjin in 1930. During the Central Plains War in 1930, Yan Xishan briefly tried to establish a rival national government in Beijing but lost the city to Zhang Xueliang, the son of Zhang Zuolin who was allied with Chiang Kai-shek.
City planning in the 1920s.
During the Beiyang period, Beijing transitioned from an imperial capital into a modern city. The city's population grew from 725,235 in 1912 to 863,209 in 1921. The municipal government reconfigured city walls and gates, paved and widened streets, installed tram service and introduced urban planning and zoning rules. The authorities also built modern water utilities, improved urban sanitation, educated the public about the proper handling of food and waste and monitored outbreaks of infectious diseases. With these public health measures, infant mortality and life expectancy of the general population improved.
Urban development also reflected changes in political attitudes as the republican form of government prevailed over the monarchy and attempts to reintroduce imperial rule. One example of the newfound emphasis on civic rights over imperial tradition was the development of city parks in Beijing. The idea of the public park as a place where common people could relax in a pastoral setting came to China from the West via Japan. Public parks in Beijing were almost all converted from imperial gardens and temples, which had previously been off-limits to most commoners. The Beijing municipal government, local gentry and merchants all promoted the development of public parks to provide wholesome entertainment and reduce alcoholism, gambling, and prostitution. After the Beijing Coup of 1924, Feng Yuxiang evicted Puyi from the Forbidden City, which was opened to the public as the Palace Museum. Parks also provided places for commercial activities and the open exchange of political and social ideas for the middle and upper classes.
The demotion of Beijing from national capital to a mere provincial city greatly constrained urban planners' initiatives to modernize the city. Along with political stature, Beiping also lost government revenue, jobs and jurisdiction. In 1921, large banks headquartered in Beijing accounted for 51.9% of bank capital held by the 23 most important banks in China. That proportion fell to just 2.8% in 1928 and 0% in 1935, as wealth followed political power out of the city. The city's jurisdiction also shrank as surrounding counties were redrawn into Hebei. For the first time since the Ming dynasty, city no longer had control over agricultural regions and watershed. Even the power plant for the city's trolley system in Tong County fell outside the city's jurisdiction. Appeals to Nanjing for the recovery of towns like Wanping and Daxing were denied. The city, anchored by its historical relics and universities, remained a center for tourism and higher education and became known as "China's Boston." In 1935, the city's population stood at 1.11 million, with another 3.485 million in the surrounding region.
Second Sino-Japanese War.
After Japan seized Manchuria through the Mukden Incident in 1931, Beiping was threatened by steady Japanese encroachment into northern China. The Tanggu Truce of 1933 gave control of the Great Wall to the Japanese and imposed a 100-km demilitarized zone south of the wall. This deprived Beiping of its northern defenses. The secret He-Umezu Agreement of May 1935 required the Chinese government to remove Central Army units from Hebei Province and suppress anti-Japanese activities by the Chinese public. The Qin-Doihara Agreement of June 1935 compelled the Nationalist 29th Army, a former unit of Feng Yuxiang's "Guominjun" that fought the Japanese in defense of the Great Wall, to evacuate from Chahar Province. This army was relocated and confined to an area south of the Beiping near Nanyuan. In November 1935, the Japanese created a puppet regime based in Tongzhou called the East Hebei Autonomous Council, which declared its independence from the Republic of China and controlled 22 counties east of Beiping, including Tongzhou and Pinggu in modern-day Beijing Municipality.
In response to the growing threat, the Palace Museum's art collection was removed to Nanjing in 1934 and air defense shelters were built in Zhongnanhai. The influx of refugees from Manchuria and presence of university campuses made Beiping a hotbed for anti-Japanese sentiment. On December 9, 1935, the university students in Beiping launched the December 9th Movement to protest the creation Hebei–Chahar Political Council, a semi-autonomous authority to administer the remainder of Hebei and Chahar not yet under direct Japanese control.
On July 7, 1937, the 29th Army and the Japanese army in China exchanged fire at the Marco Polo Bridge near the Wanping Fortress southwest of the city. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the Second Sino-Japanese War, World War II as it is known in China. After continued clashes and failed cease-fire talks, Japanese reinforcements with air support launched a full-scale offensive against Beiping and Tianjin in late July. In fighting south of the city, deputy commander of the 29th Army Tong Lin'ge and division commander Zhao Dengyu were both killed in action. They along with Zhang Zizhong, another 29th Army commander who died later in the war, are the only three modern personages after whom city streets are named in Beijing. In Tongzhou, the collaborationist militia of the East Hebei Council refused to join the Japanese in attacking the 29th Army and mutinied, but Chinese forces had retreated to the south. The city itself was spared of urban fighting and destruction that many other Chinese cities suffered in the war.
The Japanese created another puppet regime, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, to manage occupied territories in northern China and designated Beiping, renamed Beijing, as its capital. This government later merged with Wang Jingwei's Reorganized National Government of China, a collaborationist government based in Nanjing, though effective control remained with the Japanese military.
During the war, Peking and Tsinghua Universities relocated to unoccupied areas and formed the National Southwestern Associated University. Furen University was protected by the Holy See's neutrality with the Axis Powers. After the outbreak of the Pacific War with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Japanese shut down Yenching University and imprisoned its American staff. Some were rescued by Communist partisans that waged guerrilla warfare in rural outlying areas. The village of Jiaozhuanghu in Shunyi District still has a labyrinth of tunnels with underground command posts, meeting rooms, and camouflaged entrances from the war.
In 1938, the Japanese military secretly created North China Unit 1855, a biological warfare unit based in Beijing, which operated laboratories next to the Temple of Heaven, Beihai and in the Union Hospital. Like Unit 731, its more notorious counterpart, Unit 1855 devised virulent strains of bacteria and conducted lethal experiments on prisoners of war. Strains of infectious diseases developed by Unit 1855 were used about 70 times during the war, killing over 100,000 civilians in northern China. In 1943, a strain of cholera released by the unit in southern Beijing to test its virulence killed 1,872 residents. Biological warfare was banned by the Geneva Protocol of 1925. On August 15, 1945, immediately following the Japanese Emperor's announcement of surrender, Unit 1855 began removing or destroying evidence of its existence and departed the city ten days later leaving few traces of its activities. The unit evaded the Japanese war crimes tribunals and remained largely unknown until later research by historians.
On October 10, 1945, Japanese occupation of Beiping ended with surrender to Chinese Nationalist forces at a ceremony in the Forbidden City. With the end of World War II, the city reverted to Chinese Nationalist control and was renamed back to Beiping.
Chinese Civil War.
The Nationalists and Chinese Communists were allies during the Sino-Japanese War, but their domestic rivalry resumed after the defeat of Japan. To prevent the resumption of civil war, the U.S. government sent George C. Marshall to China to mediate. The Marshall Mission was headquartered in Beiping where a truce was brokered on January 10, 1946, and a three-person committee, consisting of a Nationalist, a Communist and an American representative, was created to investigate breaches in the ceasefire in North China and Manchuria. The truce began to unravel in June 1946 and the Marshall Mission ultimately failed to create a coalition government. The rape of Peking University student Shen Chong by two U.S. Marines in Dongdan on Christmas Eve 1946 sparked student demonstrations against the U.S. military presence in China. After Marshall's departure in February 1947, full-scale civil war erupted.
Beiping was the headquarters of the Nationalists' North China military operations led by Fu Zuoyi who commanded 550,000 troops. The city in 1948 had 1.5 million residents and another 4.1 million in the surrounding region. Among them were over 20,000 student airlifted out of Manchuria by Nationalist authorities to relieve pressure on food supplies in besieged cities and to prevent the youth from joining the Communist movement. Once in Beiping, the student refugees were given meager food rations but no means of reconstituting their schools. Once their rations ran out, the students marched on the city government in protest but were fired upon by the Nationalists' Youth Army, which killed at least nine and wounded 48. The July 5th Massacre was widely condemned across the country. Then vice-president Li Zongren and Fu Zuoyi met with students and promising to hold the culprits accountable. Chiang Kai-shek agreed to pull the Youth Army out of Beiping, but over 250 student organizers were arrested in August.
On November 29, 1948, the Chinese Communists' People's Liberation Army (PLA), fresh off a decisive victory in Manchuria, launched the Pingjin Campaign. They captured Zhangjiakou to the northwest on December 24 and Tianjin to the southeast on January 15, 1949. With the defeat of the Nationalists in the Huaihai Campaign further south, Fu Zuoyi and over 200,000 Nationalist defenders were surrounded in Beiping. After weeks of intensive negotiations, Fu agreed on January 22, 1949, to pull his troops out of the city for "reorganization by the PLA." His defection spared the city, its residents and its historical architecture from imminent destruction. On February 3, the PLA marched into Beiping.
In the spring of 1949, Nationalist leader Li Zongren attempted a last-ditch effort to secure a truce. Peace talks were held at the Six Nations Hotel in Beiping from April 1–12, but the Communists could not be persuaded to halt their advance at the Yangtze River and concede southern China to the Nationalists. On April 23, the PLA resumed the offensive across the Yangtze and captured the Nanjing on the following day.
As the PLA continued to gain control over the rest of the country, Communist leaders, friendly Nationalists and third party supporters convened the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at Zhongnanhai in Beiping on September 21. In preparation for establishment of a new regime, they agreed to a new name, flag, emblem, anthem and capital for the nation.
People's Republic of China.
On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong stood atop the rostrum of Tiananmen Gate, proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China. The city's name was restored to Beijing, which again served as the national capital. At the time, the city limits contained of territory and had just over 2.03 million residents. Over the next sixty years, the city would reach unprecedented size in both territory (expanding 23-fold) and population (growing ten-fold) as well as political stature and importance. As the political center of a highly centralized government, Beijing witnessed and its residents took part in many of the political events and developments that shaped modern China.
1949–1958.
The Communist leadership moved swiftly to establish a new order in Beijing. Within weeks of the founding of the new government, prostitution was banned in the city. Some 224 brothels were closed and 1,308 prostitutes were sent to reeducation centers where they received medical treatment and career retraining. Opium use was banned in 1952.
With the abolition of the unequal treaties, the foreign powers were deprived of special rights to station military units and consular offices in the Legation Quarter. The United States, France and Netherlands, which refused to recognize the new government, were forced to abandon their consulates and military offices by 1950. The Soviet Union negotiated a move to a new embassy in the northeast corner of the old city. The United Kingdom, which recognized the PRC, was among the last countries to leave the legation quarters in 1954. A new embassy district emerged east of the city walls in Sanlitun where allies in the Eastern Bloc and Third World opened diplomatic missions.
As the seat of power for the People's Republic, Beijing was transformed to reflect the ideals of socialist state. At a planning conference in November 1949, chaired by mayor Nie Rongzhen, renowned architect Liang Sicheng proposed to preserve the architectural integrity of the old walled city by building a new urban area and government center in Wukesong, Sanlihe, and Diaoyutai west of Tiananmen. Advisors from the Soviet Union countered with a proposal to concentrate new government buildings in the old urban core especially around Tiananmen Square. Building in the old city would enable government employees to reside in existing city neighborhoods as adding new residential units to accommodate a new government center in the suburbs was deemed uneconomical. The Soviet advisors also called for the city to industrialize, noting that workers accounted for only four percent of the local population and that the capital of a Communist government ought to have a strong proletarian class. The Soviet proposals largely prevailed and guided Beijing's urban planning for the next decade.
Tiananmen Square was expanded to accommodate large public rallies and parades. Landmark buildings and monuments, influenced by the socialist-realist style from the Soviet Union, including the Monument to the People's Heroes, Great Hall of the People, and the National Museum of China, were completed by 1959, in time for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. Many neighborhoods in the old city were razed to make room for factories, government bureaus and apartment buildings. Many palaces and gardens were converted to residences, schools and offices. Large factories were built in the western and eastern suburbs. The national leadership took residence in the Zhongnanhai, to the west of the Forbidden City, where the Ming dynasty royal garden and palace stood. The city wall fell into disrepair and was demolished in the 1960s during the construction of the Beijing Subway and replaced by what is now the 2nd Ring Road.
During the Korean War, Beijing hosted the Asia and Pacific Rim Peace Conference, the city's first major international gathering. The conference, organized by Mme. Sun Yat-sen, Guo Moruo and Peng Zhen and held at the Peace Hotel on October 2–12, 1952, was attended by over 400 delegates from 37 countries. The newly developed residential neighborhood of Hepingli, or Place of Peace, was named after the conference.
The city became the most concentrated center for higher education and academic research in China. Though foreign-funded universities were closed or converted to public institutions—Yenching University merged into Peking University, which moved from the city centre to the Yenching campus in the northwest suburbs and Fu Jen Catholic University merged into Beijing Normal University—the number of universities in Beijing swelled with the relocation of institutions from guerilla areas such as Renmin University, BIT, Central Party School, Central Nationalities Institute, and Beijing Foreign Studies University, and the opening of national academies and institutes by various ministries.
From 1949 to 1958, the city steadily acquired land from neighboring Hebei Province. The last major additions occurred in 1958 with the incorporation of nine counties: Tong County (now Tongzhou District), Shunyi, Daxing, Liangxiang (now part of Fangshan District), Fangshan, Pinggu, Miyun, Huairou and Yanqing, adding for a total of . In 1958, the municipal population reached 6,318,497, of which 31.5% resided in the walled city, 29% in the immediate suburbs and the remainder in outlying towns and rural areas. City planners set a target population of 10 million for Beijing.
Great Leap Forward.
In January 1958, Mao kicked off the second Five Year Plan with an ambitious campaign to accelerate economic development. The Great Leap Forward sought to overcome China's shortage of capital through mass mobilization, using large-scale collectivized farms to boost agricultural output and the food surplus to free up labor for industrial development. In urban Beijing, as in other cities, new apartment buildings were constructed without kitchens. Instead, residents dined in communal mess halls, which served free meals. Residents were mobilized to produce steel in homemade backyard furnaces using personal metal possessions (such as pots and cutlery, which they were presumed to no longer need as cooking was done centrally by the mess halls). The campaign hastened the demolition of city walls, whose bricks were used to build the furnaces. The low grade pig iron produced from these furnaces were ill-suited for industrial use. The policy was a complete failure and the misallocation of resources halted the city's reconstruction plans for years.
Among the most quixotic features early in the campaign was the effort to exterminate the Four Pests, including sparrows, which were blamed for eating grain. At the height of this effort in April 1958, over three million residents using fire crackers, gongs, clanging pots and colorful flags, literally deprived sparrows (and other birds) a place to land in the city so that the birds flew until they dropped dead from fatigue. Over 400,000 sparrows (and countless other birds) were killed over a three-day period. The campaign was halted after the eradication of sparrows led to a spike in the locust population.
Throughout the summer and fall of 1958 the quality and quantity of food served at communal mess halls steadily declined, and mess halls were shut down altogether in early 1959. Residents instead received food ration tickets (15–17 kilos of grain per month for each man, 13.75 kg for each woman, 12.75 kg for young adults, 3.75 kg for children under age 10). Due to bullish grain production forecast, winter wheat was not planted in 1958 leaving no harvest in the spring of 1959. By May 1959, residents were forced to supplement their meager diet with elm bark, reed roots, willow shoots, wild amaranth, wild celery and other edible wild plants. Malnutrition became widespread in the city. Some 420,000 residents were sent to the countryside because the city could no longer support them. The food shortage caused the rate of "deaths from non-natural causes" in the Beijing to climb from 3.64% of the total population in 1958 to 4.4% in 1961, an increase of 90,000 deaths. The famine was far more severe in other provinces where the unnatural death rate in 1960 was as high as 13.8% in Anhui and 9.08% in Sichuan.
Mao initially clung to the Great Leap Forward, firing defense minister Peng Dehuai for objecting to the policy line at the Lushan Plenum in 1959. But as the scale of the disaster became more apparent, an extraordinary work conference for cadres from around the country was hastily convened in Beijing in early 1962. At the so-called 7,000 Cadre Conference held from January 11 to February 7, President Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping reported the severe decline in the economy and called for urgent course correction, citing numerous policy failures. Mao acknowledged that mistakes were made and the need for cadres to vent. Only Lin Biao, the new defense minister, prominently defended Chairman Mao. Liu and Deng's policy arguments drew extensively on research prepared by the Beijing Municipal Government and provided by mayor Peng Zhen. The conference paved the way for economic recovery led by Liu and Deng but also planted the seeds for the Cultural Revolution.
Cultural Revolution.
The Great Proletariat Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's campaign to change the social and cultural fabric of Chinese society, was launched from and ultimately halted in Beijing, with profound consequences for the city and country.
Mao initiated the campaign by directing attacks against political-literary figures in Beijing. The first target was Wu Han, the deputy mayor of Beijing and historian, whose book "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office", adapted from a Peking opera about an incorruptible Ming-era official, had been praised by Mao in the early 1960s. But on November 10, 1965, the work was criticized by Shanghai propagandist Yao Wenyuan as an attempt to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai. Yao was supported by Mao's wife Jiang Qing. The scope of attack then expanded to the "Three Family Village", so-named for a column in the "People's Daily" jointly written by Wu Han, Deng Tuo, the editor of the newspaper, and Liao Mosha, another Beijing literary figure and official. The trio was accused of making veiled attacks against Maoism. Deng Tuo committed suicide and Wu Han later died in prison. Their fall implicated the mayor of Beijing, Peng Zhen, who was accused of running the city government as his fiefdom and harboring anti-party conspirators. The attack on Peng Zhen, in turn, undermined the standing of Liu Shaoqi, an ally of Peng and Mao's ultimate target. The Beijing Municipal Government became the first casualty of the revolution; its leaders were replaced with radical Maoists.
As Mao expanded the power struggle at the elite level in the spring of 1966, he encouraged youth from Beijing's universities and high school to join his campaign. On May 16, 1966, Mao unveiled the "May 16 Circular", which officially launched a Cultural Revolution to cleanse the party and country of bourgeois and Soviet revisionist elements such as Peng Zhen. On May 25, 1966, several junior faculty at Peking University led by Nie Yuanzi, wrote a "big-character poster" accusing the school administrators of obstructing the Cultural Revolution and calling on the masses to destroy counter revolutionary and pro-Khrushchev elements. Nie was initially rebuked by the university but her poster was published nationally with Mao's blessing in the "People's Daily" on June 2 . On June 18, Peking University students held the first struggle session denouncing their teachers. Jiang Qing visited campus to lend her support to the rebellions students. By July 29, classes at all universities and high schools in the city were halted as students mobilized to join the Cultural Revolution.
On May 29, a group of students at Tsinghua University Middle School, organized the first "Red Guard" group to protect Chairman Mao from the enemies of the revolution. Students at other Beijing schools followed. In August, Mao praised the Red Guards and called on them to "bombard the headquarters" of bourgeois elements in government. The movement spread and Mao ordered that the Red Guards be given free rides on trains and room and board across the country to spread the revolution. From August 18 to November 26, he presided over eight Red Guard rallies in Tiananmen Square attended by over 11 million youth. The rallies helped drive Liu Shaoqi from power.
Having halted classes and toppled school administrations, the Red Guards then turned to enemies of the revolution in broader society. They ransacked homes of class enemies in search of incriminating evidence, smashed cultural relics deemed to be remnants of feudal culture, and struggled against political and cultural luminaries who were accused of following the capitalist road. Within one month of Mao's first rally on August 18, they ransacked 114,000 homes in the city, seizing 3.3 million items and ¥75.2 million in cash. During the height of the Red Guard fervor in August and September, at least 1,772 residents were killed. Many were driven to suicide or beaten to death by the Red Guards. Notable Beijing residents who took their own lives include deputy mayor Liu Ren, renowned writer Lao She and table tennis star and coach Rong Guotuan. Countless others suffered public humiliation, beatings and extrajudicial detentions at the hands of Red Guards and rebels. Many historical sites, including those designated by the city's historical protection bureau, were damaged or destroyed in the mayhem. Landmarks such as the Temple of Heaven, Beihai, Old and New Summer Palaces, Ming Tombs, Yonghe Lamsery and the Great Wall were also targeted. Almost all houses of worship were shut down. The Forbidden City was protected on the orders of Premier Zhou Enlai. Many city streets were renamed after revolutionary slogans. The Red Guards sought to rename the city itself as East is Red City.
By 1967, with schools closed and authority figures toppled, Red Guard factions began to compete with each other for control of institutions they had seized. The clashes grew violent, and some groups turned to challenge Jiang Qing. In 1968, Mao ordered the military to take control of government, universities and factories and had the Red Guards disband and leave the city for the countryside where they would "undergo reeducation from the peasants". Hundreds of thousands of educated youth from Beijing were sent to rural and pastoralist areas.
The Cultural Revolution exacerbated tensions with the Soviet Union and some 300,000 city residents were mobilized to build elaborate underground bunkers designed to shelter up to 40% of the city's population in the event of a nuclear attack. Beijing's Underground City, built from 1969 to 1979, was later converted to underground shopping centers and a museum.
At the Ninth Party Congress held in Beijing in April 1969, Mao declared the Cultural Revolution completed and named Lin Biao as successor. But on September 13, 1971, Lin died in a plane crash as he tried to flee to the U.S.S.R. following an unsuccessful coup plot against Mao. After Lin's death, colleges were reopened to "Worker-Peasant-Soldier students" and some of the purged old guard leaders such as Deng Xiaoping were partially rehabilitated, but radical Gang of Four, led by Jiang Qing, continued to hold sway.
In July 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that he would be going to China and made a historic trip in February 1972 during which he met with Mao in Beijing, visited the Great Wall, received a pair of giant pandas from the Beijing Zoo and began the process of normalizing Sino-U.S. relations. The Nixon trip and the accession of the People's Republic to the China seat at the United Nations in October 1971, marked the beginning of the country's diplomatic orientation toward the Western bloc. In 1971–72, 30 countries, mostly in Europe and Latin America, severed ties with the Republic of China on Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. The embassy district in eastern Beijing, outside Dongzhimen, Chaoyangmen and Jianguomen began to expand with diplomatic compounds, hotels, and Western business interests, and eventually developed into the city's Central Business District.
After Zhou Enlai died on January 8, 1976, Yao Wenyuan published a series of propaganda works criticizing the legacy of Zhou, which drew widespread public disapproval. On March 20, 1976, students from the Niufang Primary School laid a wreath at the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square to commemorate Zhou, and others followed. Many of the wreaths carried poems remembering the Premier also criticized the Gang of Four through allegorical allusions. By the time of Qingming Festival on April 4, a traditional tomb-sweeping holiday, the square was filled with wreaths and poetry and an estimated two million city residents visited to pay their respects. The following day, the Gang of Four ordered the police to seize and destroy the wreaths and seal off the square from further access. In clashes with residents, hundreds were arrested. The April Fifth Incident, the largest spontaneous public gathering against the Cultural Revolution, was branded a counter-revolutionary criminal incident blamed on Deng Xiaoping, who was purged.
Mao died in Beijing on September 9, 1976, and his mausoleum in Tiananmen Square was completed one year later. Less than one month after his death on October 7, 1976, the Gang of Four was arrested in Zhongnanhai by Mao's former security chief, Wang Dongxing, in a bloodless coup supported by Mao's anointed successor Hua Guofeng and military chief Ye Jianying. The arrests ended the Cultural Revolution. Deng Xiaoping was rehabilitated and then wrested power away from Hua. At the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee held in December 1978, the Party, under Deng's leadership, rehabilitated the victims of Cultural Revolution, reversed the verdict of the April Fifth Incident, and adopted a policy course of economic reforms. College entrance exams were restored in 1977 and most of the rusticated youth returned to the city.
1976–1989.
Beijing Spring.
As the national leadership was changing course, a brief period of political openness in the city known as Beijing Spring gave rise to a grassroots pro-democracy movement. In September 1978, a magazine of the Party Youth League, under the leadership of party liberal Hu Yaobang, sought to publish poetry from the April 5th Incident. The publication was blocked by propaganda chief Wang Dongxing for failing to praise Mao. In November, the articles were instead posted on a wall near a bus stop on Chang'an Avenue at Xidan, west of Tiananmen Square. Subsequently, Huang Xiang and several poets from Guizhou, who had posted political poetry outside the "People's Daily" office on Wangfujing Avenue in October, also posted their works on the wall. Others soon followed suit and the Xidan Democracy Wall, as it became known, attracted thousands of posters and hundreds of thousands of readers. Victims of the Cultural Revolution sought justice—some called for the release of those jailed in the April Fifth Incident of 1976; some criticized Mao and Hua Guofeng's continuation of the Maoist line; and others complained of youth unable to return from the countryside. On November 26, Deng Xiaoping told a visiting Japanese politician that the writing of the big-character posters was protected by the Constitution. On December 5, Wei Jingsheng, an electrician at the Beijing Zoo, posted "The Fifth Modernization" a call for political reform. A public forum convened at the Monument to the People's Heroes where speakers debated the political future of the country.
On January 3, 1979, a "People's Daily" editorial, declared: "Let the people's say what they wish. The heavens will not fall." On January 14, a crowd of Cultural Revolution victims marched from Tiananmen Square to Zhongnanhai calling for food, work, democracy and human rights. A China Human Rights Association was formed and distributed 19-point declaration demanding the freedom of speech and right to evaluate state leaders. The gatherings and public challenge to authority alarmed party conservatives who pressed Deng to take a harder line and he did so after consolidating control of the party. In late March, the city government restricted public postings and gatherings to only Xidan. Wei Jingsheng was arrested, and convicted and sentenced in October to 15 years in imprisonment for leaking state secrets about China's war with Vietnam. In December 1979, postings at the Xidan Wall were banned and instead consigned to the Temple of the Moon. In 1980, the State Constitution (1978 version) was amended to eliminate the right to post big-character posters. Although Beijing Spring ended, the tensions within the party between liberals and conservatives over the toleration of dissent continued into the next decade.
Urban planning in the 1980s.
As the city emerged from the Mao era, urban planning in Beijing moved in a new direction. In April 1980, in reviewing the city's application for infrastructure funding, Hu Yaobang, the newly designated CCP General Party Secretary set forth the guiding principles for Beijing's development. As the country's political center, Beijing should become a center for international exchange to support China's opening to the world. As a window to the world, the city should be the most orderly, clean and scenic city in the country. The city should also strive to become among the most advanced in the world for science and technology, culture and education. The city should raise the standard of living for its residents and develop an economy suitable for the unique qualities of the national capital. Beijing would no longer attract heavy industry. In 1981, city planners devised a blueprint that organized urban expansion around concentric ring roads. The aging inner core of the city, where the historical relics are concentrated, would have low density development and renewed over time. New enterprises would be built in the second band (between the 2nd and 3rd Ring Roads). With the imposition of the one-child policy, city planners expected to control the city's population to 10 million by 2000 with 40% living in the urban center and the remainder in residential communities scattered around the third band. Examples of these satellite communities include the Asian Games Village in the north and Fangzhuang in the south. Beijing Subway's first line, which commenced trial operations in 1969 but was plagued by technical problems, finally passed inspection assessments in 1981.
1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.
The student-led demonstrations in the spring of 1989, which drew broad support from city residents, attracted worldwide attention and exposed deep divisions within the country's leadership, ended in bloodshed on June 3–4, as conservative leaders ordered a military crackdown of unprecedented force. The confrontation in Tiananmen Square was the culmination of a decade-long debate within the Communist Party and society over the freedom of expression and the course of political reform.
As liberal leaders Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang guided the country through economic reforms, conservative leaders pushed back with a Campaign against "Spiritual Pollution" in 1983. Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping sided with the reformers and ended that campaign. By 1986, newspaper editorials began calling for political reform and university students organized democracy salons. Liberal physicist Fang Lizhi toured campuses, advocating democratic reforms and the independence of universities from the government. In December 1986, student protests in Hefei spread to Beijing, where students marched around campuses in the university district northwest of the city, calling for direct election of political representatives, freedom of the press and release of political prisoners. On January 1 and 2, 1987, several hundred students attempted to march on Tiananmen Square in defiance of orders of the city government. The protests attracted little public attention but party conservatives reacted with fury at Hu Yaobang for his "weak" response to "bourgeois liberalism". Hu Yaobang was forced to resign on January 17 and Fang Lizhi was expelled from the Communist Party. Zhao Ziyang succeeded Hu as Party General Secretary and Li Peng became Premier.
When Hu Yaobang died suddenly on April 15, 1989, university students laid wreaths at the Monument to the People's Heroes and organized sit-ins outside the Great Hall of the People and Zhongnanhai. They demanded the Party rescind past criticism of Hu, renounce the campaigns against spiritual pollution and bourgeois liberalism, disclose the assets of the family members of party officials, lift orders against public assembly, permit freedom of the press, and increase salaries for university graduates. On the night of April 21, 100,000 students marched into Tiananmen Square to attend Hu's funeral, which was held inside the Great Hall of the People the following day. Officials inside the Hall did not meet with students in the Square, who began to boycott classes. Workers formed an independent union and joined the protests. On April 23, as Zhao Ziyang was departing for a trip to North Korea, he told Li Peng to restore normalcy, avoid worsening tensions with students and refrain from using force, except against those who commit offenses against life and property.
On April 24, at a meeting of the politburo chaired by Li Peng, Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing and Mayor Chen Xitong said the student demonstrations were manipulated by plotters seeking to overthrow the party-state and had to be halted. The following day, Deng Xiaoping, after hearing reports from Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun, called the demonstrations a "disturbance" that was to be halted through coercive measures. Deng's characterization was published in the "People's Daily" editorial of April 26. The students felt maligned by the editorial and 100,000 from more than 40 universities marched to the city center, past Tiananmen Square to the Lama Temple, breaking through police blockades along the way.
When Zhao Ziyang returned from North Korea, he delivered a conciliatory speech commemorating the 70th Anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, which was favorably received by the students. On May 4, he also told the board of the Asian Development Bank that there would not be turmoil in China, that the students, who accepted the country's reforms, were not fundamentally opposed to party leadership and socialism, but simply wanted leaders to correct errors in their work. Students from 47 institutions, including thousands streaming in from other parts of the country, marched on May 4 without police interference. On May 8, Zhao Ziyang chaired a politburo standing committee meeting and proposed six points of reform including the disclosure of officials' assets, expanded press freedoms and rule of law. Wan Li, chairman of the National People's Congress, called a parliamentary session for June 20 to consider the reform agenda. Li Peng, however, opposed the agenda, and only a portion of which was published in the "People's Daily" on May 9.
On May 13, to support political reforms and demonstrate their peaceful resolve, about 300 students began a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square, which soon expanded to thousands. A makeshift tent city was set up for the hunger strikers, who attracted broad public sympathy. On May 15–17, more than million people visited the Square each day. Many government employees marched in support. Relaxed censorship allowed news of the hunger strike to be broadcast nationally. Foreign press on hand to cover the visit of Mikhail Gorbachev brought worldwide attention to the demonstrations. On May 18, Li Peng met with several student representatives but the two sides failed to agree on how to end the hunger strike. To defuse tensions, Zhao Ziyang tried to persuade Deng Xiaoping to back off of the April 26 editorial, but Li Peng said Zhao's approach was not working and the party center could not afford to speak with two voices. Student protests had spread to 27 cities. On the night of May 17, Deng Xiaoping resolved to impose martial law, which was signed by Li Peng and announced by Chen Xitong on May 19. That night, Zhao Ziyang made his final appearance in public, warning the hunger striking students in the Square that he had come too late. The students called off the hunger strike.
On May 20, at least 180,000 People's Liberation Army and People's Armed Police personnel advanced on the city to enforce martial law, but students and Beijing residents managed to block them outside the Third Ring Road by surrounding their vehicles. Residents brought food and water to the soldiers and pleaded with them not to advance on the peaceful demonstrations. More than a million people marched in defiance of the martial law order, many calling for the resignation of Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng. The troops pulled back on May 23. The commander of the 38th Army, who refused to enforce the martial law order, was court-martialed. On May 27, student leaders voted to end their occupation of the Square on May 30, but some students remained, believing that the protests would lose leverage and held out hope that National People's Congress would convene in June. On May 25, Wan Li, who had been on a foreign trip, was summoned by Zhao to call an emergency parliamentary meeting to invalidate the martial law order. But Wan's plane was diverted to Shanghai, and he subsequently declared support for martial law. On May 30, students and teachers from the Central Academy of Arts erected a 10-meter high "Goddess of Democracy" statue in the Square, which boosted student morale and drew millions of visitors.
On the afternoon of June 3, demonstrators confronted soldiers in plain clothes sneaking weapons into the city and police fired tear gas at the demonstrators. That evening, state-run television warned residents to stay indoors but crowds of people took to the streets to block the incoming army. Armored military units advanced on Beijing from every cardinal direction. At about 10:00 pm troops opened fire on protesters with live ammunition at Wukesong intersection west of the Square, where the first civilian fatality occurred. Crowds were stunned and responded by hurling insults and projectiles. Among those killed was Duan Changlong, a Tsinghua University student, who was shot in the chest as he tried to negotiate with soldiers at Xidan. Duan was the grand nephew of the warlord Duan Qirui, whose troops were responsible for the March 18 Massacre in 1926, deadliest use of force against students in the history of Beijing until 1989. As news of the lethal force reached the Square, students at the Square were persuaded to leave the Square by several older intellectuals, including future Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Xiaobo. At about 4:00 am, troops from the west and south fought their way to the Square, and at 5:00 am most of the students retreated out of the Square to the south. Several students were hit by lethal gunfire in the Square and nearly a dozen were run over by an armored personnel vehicle west of the Square. Tanks also ran over the tent city. Helicopters lifted away the debris. By dawn of June 4, the army controlled the Square and major intersections around the city although clashes with residents continued. Tiananmen Mothers, a victims' organization, has recorded civilian deaths all along Chang'an Avenue, from Wukesong in the west to Tiananmen in the center to Jianguomen in the east, and throughout the city, from Hongmiao in the east, Hepingli in the north, and Tianqiao and Zhushikou in the south. Hundreds of civilians were killed, thousands were wounded and thousands more were detained.
On June 5, foreign press in the Beijing Hotel photographed a lone protester blocking a long column of tanks driving east of the Square on Chang'an Avenue. The identity of this protester, like many facts about the events of spring 1989, remains unknown because the government has barred any reporting, research or remembrance of the "June 4 Incident", which was officially deemed a counterrevolutionary rebellion. Zhao Ziyang was placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life. Jiang Zemin assumed the position of General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. Martial law was lifted on January 11, 1990. In subsequent years, first-year students at colleges in Beijing were required to undergo a year of military training.
1990s.
In 1990, Beijing's long-term residential population reached 10.32 million, of which 61% were in urban areas. In addition, the city had 1.27 million non-resident migrants, for a total population of 11.59 million.
From September 22 to October 7, 1990, Beijing hosted the 11th Asian Games, which were held in China for the first time and attended by 6,122 athletes from 37 countries competing in 29 sports. The city was awarded the games in 1984 over Osaka. The Asian Games Village was built north of the city center beyond the Third Ring Road. The Worker Stadium served as the Games' main venue. The city's bid for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games ended in September 1993 with a narrow loss by a vote of 43–45 in the final round to Sydney.
The 2nd Ring Road, under construction since the 1960s and built on the foundation of the outer Ming city wall, was finally completed in 1992. Where city gates once stood are now overpass exits. The 3rd Ring Road followed in 1993. Construction of the city's three other ring roads began in the 1990s and were completed in 2001 (4th Ring), 2003 (5th Ring) and 2009 (6th Ring).
The 1990s and the start of the new millennium were a period of rapid economic growth in Beijing. Following the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping, what was once farmland surrounding the city was developed into new residential and commercial districts. Modern expressways and high-rise buildings were built throughout the city to accommodate the growing and increasingly affluent population of the city. Foreign investment transformed Beijing into one of the most cosmopolitan and prosperous cities in the world. In September 1995, the city hosted the United Nation's Fourth World Conference on Women and a parallel gathering of non-government organizations in Huairou District.
Also in 1995, Beijing's city government was shaken by a leadership scandal as Chen Xitong, party secretary and a member of the politburo, was removed from office and deputy-mayor Wang Baosen committed suicide. Chen was convicted and sentenced to 16 years imprisonment in 1998 of corruption and negligence of official duty and became the highest ranking Chinese official to be convicted of a crime since the trial of the Gang of Four. Chen reportedly lost a power struggle against Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the "Shanghai Clique". He maintained that the charges against him were politically motivated.
In March 1997, two bombs detonated on Beijing buses. The first bomb hit a Route 22 Bus in Xidan on the night of March 7, killing three and injuring ten. The second, one day later, claimed two more lives. The bombings, which followed the outbreak of protests and bombings in Xinjiang, took place during the annual sessions of the legislature and political consultative conference in the capital, and were widely blamed on Uyghur separatists. In 1999, the Xinjiang Village at Ganjiakou, was demolished a mere seven years after the Haidian government had recognized it. Though Uyghur shopowners were compensated for their losses, their community in the capital scattered.
In the spring of 1999, two large public demonstrations took place in Beijing. On April 25, over 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners assembled outside Zhongnanhai to protest criticism of the sect in the state media. The gathering resulted in the government's prohibition of Falun Gong in China. On May 8, following NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, which killed three Chinese nationals, thousands of students and residents marched on the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to protest U.S. military aggression. Some of the protesters pelted the embassy compound with stones and smashed cars, keeping the U.S. ambassador and staff confined in the compound for several days. Then vice-president Hu Jintao declared the government's support for the demonstrations, which reflected the anger and patriotism of the Chinese people, but urged against extreme and illegal conduct. The crisis was diffused after U.S. President Bill Clinton issued an apology for the airstrike, which the Pentagon blamed on outdated maps, and agreed to pay $32.5 million to the victims of the bombing and to compensate for the damage to the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. The Chinese government agreed to pay $2.87 million to compensate the U.S. for damage to its embassy and consulates in China.
On October 1, 1999, the city celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic with a parade, the first since 1984.
2000s.
In 2000, the city's total population reached 13.56 million, including 2.49 million temporary migrants. The city's population has continued to grow, largely through inbound migration, reaching 15.38 million in 2005 (including 3.57 million temporary migrants) and exceeding 20 million in 2011. Of the 20.18 million total population in 2011, 12.77 million were long-term residents with temporary migrants making up 7.4 million (36.7%).
On July 13, 2001, at the 112th meeting of the International Olympic Committee in Moscow, Beijing was awarded the right to host the 2008 Summer Olympic and Paralympics Games. Under the motto "New Beijing, Great Olympics", the city pledged that holding the Games in China for the first time would promote not only the city's economy but also education, health and human rights of its residents. Beijing prevailed over Paris, Toronto, Istanbul and Osaka with an absolute majority of votes in the second round of balloting.
Over the next seven years, the city spent nearly ¥300 billion (about US$36 billion in 2005 exchange rate) in preparation. The city built 12 permanent athletic venues and 8 temporary venues, expanded 11 existing venues, and renovated 45 practice facilities. The bulk of the new venues was concentrated in the Olympic Green directly north of Tiananmen and the Forbidden City. Venues accounted for less than 5% of overall Olympic spending, the lion's share of which went to building infrastructure, including of express highways, , Terminal 3 of the Capital Airport and the Beijing South railway station, and a high-speed high-speed railway to Tianjin. To improve environmental quality, the city added nine sewage treatment plants, dredged of waterways and built waste incineration and wind power generation facilities. From 2001 to 2007, the city's economy doubled in size and per capita income rose from $3,262 to $7,654.
In March 2003, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) spread to Beijing from southern China. Initial underreporting of the epidemic by government authorities was exposed by Dr. Jiang Yanyong in early April and forced Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and mayor Meng Xuenong to resign in April. The city became the hardest hit in the SARS epidemic with 2,521 probable cases (including at least 394 infected medical personnel) and 191 deaths. Public schools, theaters, discos, and entertainment centers were closed at the order of the government in late April when 100 new cases were reported daily. A large quarantine base was set up in Changping District north of the city. After the last new case was reported on May 29, the epidemic subsided and the World Health Organization lifted the travel advisory for Beijing on June 24.
Rapid modernization and population growth also created numerous problems such as heavy traffic, pollution, the destruction of historic neighborhoods, and a large population of impoverished migrant workers from the countryside. By early 2005, the city government attempted to control urban sprawl by restricting development to two semicircular bands to the west and east of the city center, instead of the concentric rings of suburbs that had been built in the past.
The rapid growth of population, motor vehicles and factories has created high pollution levels. Days with gray, acrid skies, with an eye-reddening pollution score over 400, are common, as health officials advise wearing masks and staying indoors. Heavy trucks are allowed in only at night but their diesel fuels create much of the problem. By 2008 for the city's 12 million residents, pollution was not only a hazard, but a political issue tied in with the Summer Olympics scheduled for August 2008. The city's bid for the 2000 Olympics in 1993 failed partly because of high pollution levels; in response the city began a massive cleanup campaign. That campaign has been successful in terms of 2000 standards, but the city's economy is 2.5 times larger now, with millions more people. Over 3 million cars and trucks clog the streets, and 400,000 more are added annually as the wealth shoots up rapidly. Factories and power plants were changed to burn cleaner, low-sulfur coal; sulfur dioxide emissions fell by 25% 2001–2007, even though much more coal is burned, reaching 30 million tons in 2006. Furthermore, Beijing saw more than 160 million square meters (1.7 billion square feet) of new construction begun 2002–2007 due to pollution. Athletes may have some breathing problems, but in the long-run air quality is expected to remain a critical issue as the city grows beyond 20 million inhabitants. The city also imposed road space rationing, which remained in force after the Olympics.
The 2008 Summer Olympics opened on August 8, 2008, at 8:08 p.m. with a grand ceremony at the Beijing National Stadium ("Bird's Nest"). Along with 10,942 athletes from 204 countries and regions who competed in 28 sports and 302 events, leaders from 80 countries also gathered in Beijing, for the largest international event in the city's history. China, became the 22nd country to host the Olympics, and won the most gold medals for the first time. A record 86 countries medaled, with the United States topping the overall medal count. Some 1.7 million city residents volunteered during the games, setting an Olympic record. In keeping with its promise to IOC authorities that the right of public assembly would be respected during the Games, Beijing authorities designated three city parks as areas for demonstrations, but no permits for public demonstration were issued—the applications were either withdrawn or denied—and none took place.
On October 1, 2009, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, a military parade was held on Chang'an Avenue and a gala concert in Tiananmen Square.
2010s.
In the five years after the Olympics, Beijing's economy continued to grow rapidly, and the government's massive economic stimulus program in response to the global recession added enormous wealth to the city. By the end of 2012, the city's economy was 1.8 times bigger than in 2008 and triple the size of 2004. Due to the concentration of state owned enterprises in the national capital, Beijing in 2013 had more Fortune Global 500 Company headquarters than any other city in the world. It also ranked No. 4 in the number of billionaire residents after Moscow, New York and Hong Kong.
The rapid economic growth and expansionary monetary policy, which caused property prices to rise throughout China, made Beijing one of the most expensive cities in the country. By 2010, new apartments inside the Third Ring Road cost Y30,000 per m2 (US$360 per sq. ft.), about ten times the average monthly wages. In response, the city government pledged to build low-income housing and imposed stringent limitations on home ownership. In February 2011, Beijing couples who already owned two or more homes and single residents with at least one home were barred from buying additional properties in the city. Individuals without resident permits, who can own only one property in the city, must pay local income tax for five consecutive years before they are eligible to buy it. In March 2013, the state imposed capital gains taxes on real estate transactions and raised down payment requirements for mortgages, but prices continued to climb. By August 2013, the average price of apartments inside the Fourth Ring Road reached Y42,259 per m2 (US$634 per sq. ft.), nearly twice as high as in 2009, leading to concerns of a property bubble.
The 22nd annual meeting of leaders from countries in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum was held in Beijing on November 10–12, 2014. An international convention center was built by Yanqi Lake in Huairou District for the occasion.
On September 3, 2015, a massive military parade was held to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the victory in World War II with leaders from over two dozen countries attending and honor guards from 17 countries joining the People's Liberation Army in the procession.
On 18 November 2017, a fire killed nineteen people in Beijing in a southern industrial neighborhood. The municipal government launched a forty-day campaign to demolish "illegal structures", which housed millions of workers from foreign countries, who the government deems as Beijing's "low-end population".

Lost Treasure (magazine)

Lost Treasure was an American magazine, found both online and in print, which described lost treasures and different methods and items used for finding them. Examples were lost mines, and valuables lost through wars, theft, or forgetfulness. The magazine was launched in 1966. It was published on a monthly basis and included tests of various metal detectors. The headquarters of the magazine was in Grove, Oklahoma. It was published by Lost Treasure, Inc.
The articles in "Lost Treasure" described these matters in great detail, covering money lost in the American Civil War; stagecoach and train robberies committed by famous and not-so-famous outlaws, such as Jesse James and the Wild Bunch, lost mines such as the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine, and treasure ships lost at sea due to pirates and foul weather. The magazine also depicted the locations of various ghost towns, offering an insight into history, especially that of the United States.
The magazine used a combination of photos and drawings to illustrate the articles, such as pictures of ships, stagecoaches, old guns such as muskets and "six-shooters," gunfights, old buildings, and animals. The animals mainly include snakes and scorpions crawling about in or on boxes and chests. Some chests were damaged by theft and/or by the elements, exposing their contents, often gold, silver coins and/or jewels, and gold and/or silver ingots. Other pictures include outlaws, pirates, and "lawmen," such as Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson. The illustrations were usually done in pencil or charcoal, and some were copies of oil or watercolor illustrations.
Famous people depicted included Pancho Villa and William Quantrill, alleged to have cached various loot and treasures.
In some old houses the windowsills and the walls often concealed treasures, including historical relics, such as period newspapers and comic books, as well as money. It was expected that the treasure hunter, called a TH'er, respect people and property, and this was also strongly stated in the magazine. The December 2018 issue was the final issue.

Edith Fabbri House

The Edith Fabbri House is an Italian Renaissance revival-style townhouse that is located at 7 East 95th Street on New York City's Upper East Side.
History.
Designed by architect Grosvenor Atterbury and completed in 1916 for Edith Shepard (a daughter of Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt and Elliott Fitch Shepard) and her husband Ernesto Giuseppi Fabbri Jr., the house was constructed around Shepard and Fabbri's architectural piece collection.
The highlight of the house is its library, which showcases historic panels from the Palazzo Ducale di Urbino in Italy. The library also includes an Aeolian Opus 1398 organ from 1916.
The home was deeded to the Episcopal Church in 1949, and it now serves as a retreat house under the name of "The House of the Redeemer". The mansion became a New York City Designated Landmark on July 23, 1974.

Miami Correctional Facility

The Miami Correctional Facility is a state prison located near Bunker Hill, Indiana, on the site of the Grissom Joint Air Reserve Base at West 850 South and US-31, about north of Kokomo, Indiana. It was established in 1998 and houses high-, medium-, and minimum-security inmates, all of whom are adult males. At full capacity, Miami can house 3,188 prisoners, making it the largest facility in the state of Indiana. The level-one inmates are housed outside of the prison fence in dormitory-style living units which can accommodate a maximum of 204 prisoners. The high- and medium-security facilities are inside of the fence and hold the level-two, three, and four inmates in two-man cells.
History.
On March 6, 1996, the Indiana Prison Site Selection Committee announced that the downsized Grissom Air Force Base would be the site for the state's newest prison. The committee had wanted to ensure that the prison was erected in an area that was not in opposition to a prison. The Miami community had promoted their county through a yellow ribbon campaign for the new prison site because such a facility would provide needed local jobs that had been lost when the air force base, the county's largest employer, downsized.
Construction of Phase I began in August 1997 and was ready for the first inmates to arrive in May 1999. John VanNatta, the first superintendent of Miami Correctional Facility, arrived with the first wave of prisoners. He had previously served as the superintendent of the Atterbury Correctional Facility for ten years. Construction of Phase II of the facility began in 1999 and opened to inmates in October 2001. Superintendent VanNatta was called up in January 2003 from Indiana's reserve to serve as warden of Guantanamo Bay Prison. Stanley Knight filled in for VanNatta during his absence. Walter Martin assumed the post in June 2006 when VanNatta took a job with the federal government. Mark Sevier became the next superintendent and transferred to Westville Correctional Facility in 2014, who was followed by Kathy Griffin in December 2014. Griffin is a retired Army First Sergeant and former Superintendent of Chain O' Lakes Correctional Facility. In late 2017, William Wilson became the interim warden until March 2018, when he was replaced by the current warden, William "Bill" Hyatte. In late 2015, Miami Correctional Facility was upgraded from a level 2/3 facility to a level 3/4 facility. Level 4 offenders are the highest offender classification in Indiana, meaning that this facility currently houses offenders who have committed the worst crimes.
Methamphetamine unit.
In April 2005, a prison unit designed to work with inmates who are addicted to the drug methamphetamine (meth) was opened at Miami Correctional Facility. This program was one of the first of its kind in the nation. Methamphetamine use has increased significantly in Indiana since 1994, as meth labs are the most concentrated in the Midwest. The goal of the program is to prevent repeat crimes related to methamphetamine use that would land inmates back in prison after their release.
The program, titled "Clean Lifestyle is Freedom Forever" (CLIFF), is voluntary as well as residential; inmates must live in the unit which is separate from rest of the prison. This intensive four-stage program requires that participants spend 10 hours a day on weekdays participating in program activities. The first stage of the program is education about the circumstances that lead to addiction to meth and ways to avoid these traps. The second and third stage are treatment, which addresses various medical problems that are consequences of meth abuse. The fourth stage of the program prepares participants for re-entry into the outside world. After inmates are released, the program will continue to monitor participants' progress as they readjust to life outside of confinement. CLIFF deducts 6 months from prisoners' sentences upon successful completion. In 2018, the CLIFF program was replaced by the RWI (Recovery While Incarcerated) Program, which focuses on drug rehabilitation in general.
Migrant detention unit.
In 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a partnership with the state of Indiana to house up to 1000 detained migrants. DHS has branded it as the "Speedway Slammer" in a similar naming convention to the South Florida Detention Facility in Florida. The IndyCar series, who run the Indianapolis 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, stated that they are "communicating our preference that our IP not be utilized moving forward in relation to this matter".

Ivelin Popov

Ivelin Ivanov Popov (; born 26 October 1987) is a Bulgarian professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Bulgarian First League club Botev Plovdiv.
Club career.
Youth career.
Born in Sofia, Popov started to play football in Septemvri Sofia's academy. Then he played for the youth formations of Levski Sofia from 1999 to 2004. In 2005, he trained for four months with Feyenoord but did not sign with the team because he was not 18 years old. After that, he returned to Bulgaria and played in a tournament for Beroe's youth team and there he was spotted by the Litex Lovech scouts. On 14 July 2005, he even scored a goal for Beroe in a friendly game.
Litex Lovech.
Popov signed his first professional contract with Litex Lovech in December 2005. He made his European debut in the first leg of Round of 32 Stage in a 0–0 draw against Strasbourg; he made his official debut in the Bulgarian top division in a match against CSKA Sofia on 12 March 2006. He played 59 minutes. The result of the match was a 1–1 draw. On 9 April 2006, he scored his first goal in professional football against Lokomotiv Sofia. The result of the match was a 3–1 win for Litex. The same season, Popov played in 11 matches and scored five goals. In two consecutive seasons, Popov was third placed in the voting for Young player of the year award in 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. In the 2007–08 UEFA Cup, Popov scored a brace, in a first leg of second round, in a 3–0 win over Besa Kavajë. Eventually, Litex Lovech advanced to the next round, losing to Hamburger SV in two's leg.
On 18 September 2008, Popov scored a goal in the first round of the UEFA Cup against Aston Villa. In July 2009, Popov was given the captain's armband. At the end of the season, Popov was awarded A League's player of the season after having the most votes in the poll.
In August 2010, he went on trial to Premier League club Blackburn Rovers. He impressed the club, whereafter he received a contract offer, but the move collapsed over his work permit rejected by the British Government, having not played enough international matches.
Kuban Krasnodar.
On 25 August 2012, Popov joined Russian Premier League club Kuban Krasnodar on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. According to Chempionat.com, the fee was worth €2 million. He made his debut for the club, coming on as a substitute for Marcos Pizzelli, in a 2–1 win over Dynamo Moscow on 2 September 2012. On 26 October 2012, Popov scored his first goal for the club in a 1–0 win over Rostov. Less than a month later he scored his first brace, putting two goals past Krylia Sovetov and contributing with an assist in a 4–1 home victory. On 13 April 2013, Popov scored a late equalizer in a 2–2 draw away from home to Terek Grozny. On 4 May, he scored a brace as Kuban beat Rostov 2–0 away from home on. On the last day of the 2012–13 season, Popov scored the only goal in a vital 1–0 home victory over Anzhi Makhachkala, securing Kuban a European debut in the Third Qualifying Round of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League and earning them their best ever finish in the top flight at fifth, having the same points as fourth-placed Spartak Moscow. He finished the season with 9 goals as the club's top goalscorer together with Aras Özbiliz.
Because of his outstanding performance in the 2012–13 season, Popov was appointed captain of Kuban Krasnodar for the 2013–14 season. He captained his team to its first away victory of the season over Russian Premier League newcomer, Tom Tomsk, by contributing with a pair of assists. The match ended with a 2–1 score. His first brace came shortly after, in a historical first ever match in a European championship for Kuban. He netted two goals in a 2–0 away victory over Scottish Premier League runners-up Motherwell in the first leg of a qualifying match for the UEFA Europa League. Both goals were assisted by teammate Ibrahima Baldé. This resulted in his jersey being displayed in the National football museum.
On 28 April 2014, Ivelin Popov scored an away brace against strong Spartak Moscow in a 2–0 victory. This outstanding performance got him voted as player of week 27 in the Russian Premier League. He continued his good run the week after, which saw him providing two assists, marking a 4–0 victory over Krylia Sovetov. The first assist was turned into a goal, scored by fellow Bulgarian teammate Stanislav Manolev, marking his first goal for the club after recently being transferred from PSV Eindhoven. Popov was named man of the match for the second time in a row, earning him a spot in Russian premier league team of the week. He finished his season in Russia having provided 12 assists; making him the joint top assists provider of the season, alongside Danny from Zenit St. Petersburg. He was also included in the team of the season 2013–14, because of his consistency throughout the whole campaign.
Spartak Moscow.
On 3 June 2015, it was announced that Popov had signed a long-term contract with Spartak Moscow. It was reported that the signing fee cost the club about €7 million. Popov made his league debut for Spartak as a starter in a 2–2 home draw to Ufa on 17 July. He scored his first two official goals for the club on 23 September, in a 7–0 win away to Volga Nizhny Novgorod in the Round of 32 in the Russian Cup. He followed that with his first league goal for the club, coming against Zenit as Spartak drew 2–2 at home. The goal featured a spectacular lob over Zenit defender Javi García, followed by another lob over the goalkeeper Yuri Lodigin. Popov's performance earned him the Best Player award for the tenth round of the 2015–16 Russian Premier League, as well as the most valuable player award for the month of September. He scored for the third consecutive game on 3 October, netting the only goal in a 1–0 win away to Mordovia Saransk.
On 30 April 2017, he provided two assists in a 2–1 away victory over city rivals, CSKA Moscow, which earned him a spot in the Russian Premier League team of the week for matchday 26.
On 8 January 2019, he was released from his Spartak contract by mutual consent.
Rubin Kazan.
On 12 January 2018, he joined FC Rubin Kazan on loan until the end of the 2017–18 season. He scored on his debut for the club, in a 1–1 away draw against Anzhi on 2 March 2018. On 7 April 2018, he scored a brace in a 3–2 home win against Akhmat, which saw him being named Man of the Match for the second match in a row.
Rostov.
On 24 January 2019, he signed a 2.5-year contract with Russian club FC Rostov.
Sochi.
On 23 August 2020, he moved to another Russian club PFC Sochi in exchange for Dmitry Poloz moving the other way.
Levski Sofia.
On 28 April 2022, Popov signed a two-year contract with Levski Sofia beginning from the 2022–23 season, thus returning to his home country after 12 years.
Botev Plovdiv.
On 15 August 2023, Popov moved to Botev Plovdiv from Levski Sofia after terminating his contract, thus joining as a free agent.
International career.
In August 2007, Dimitar Penev called-up Popov in the Bulgaria national team for the friendly match with Wales. On 11 February 2009, he scored his first goal for Bulgaria against Switzerland. On 2 April 2009, Popov scored the first of two goals for Bulgaria in the 2–0 win against Cyprus. On 17 September 2010, during a friendly match against Serbia, he became the youngest player to captain the national side.
On 9 February 2011, Popov scored twice from the penalty spot in a 2–2 friendly draw with Estonia, but the result was subsequently declared void by FIFA and expunged from the records due to suspicions of match fixing with the involvement of the game officials. He captained the national team during the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, providing his team with two goals, including a 25-yard free kick goal against Armenia, throughout a tough campaign, having to face strong national teams like those of Italy, the Czech Republic and Denmark.
In 2015, Popov was a crucial figure in the 2–2 home draw versus Italy. He hit the back of the net to tie the score at 1–1 in the 11th minute, raising the spirits of his compatriots after a disappointing own-goal in the 4th minute. This resulted in a series of swift attacks from the home team which saw them grab the lead in the 17th minute. They were able to keep their lead until the 84th minute, but in the end had to settle for a 2–2 draw after a late equalizer. In the next official match, he once again proved his worth after the only goal in a tough but decisive 0–1 away win against Malta, keeping the hopes alive of his national team qualifying for Euro 2016.
On 31 August 2017, Ivelin Popov provided two decisive assists in a 3–2 home win against Sweden. He announced his retirement from international football in November 2019.
Controversies.
Popov's name became associated with scandal early in his career and became synonymous with irresponsibility and lack of discipline. In April 2007, he was removed from Litex's starting roster due to bad form.
In September 2008, Popov was banned from the youth national team following an incident on the team bus, where he threw a bottle at the bus driver–-hitting him on the head–-who then lost control, narrowly avoiding a crash.
In September 2010, just days before the Euro 2012 qualifier against England, Popov led a group of teammates out of the training camp in Pravets and took them to Botevgrad so they could celebrate Valeri Bojinov's birthday, where the players consumed large amounts of alcohol. Days later, Bulgaria lost to England 4–0. In September 2011, as Bulgaria was preparing to host England for the second leg of the Euro 2012 qualifier, Popov again led a group of players to a bar, where they drank until 4 am, angering then coach Lothar Matthäus. Bulgaria lost to England 3–0 at home.
On 16 November 2014, Popov missed a penalty against Malta in a Euro 2016 qualifier, allowing for the match to end in a 1–1 draw. Following the game, Popov was accused of missing the penalty on purpose. Days later, it came to light that Popov had abused and humiliated the national team masseuse on several occasions, forcing him to do pushups in front of the other players. At this point, the executive committee of the Bulgarian Football Union had seen enough and proceeded to ban Popov from the national team for life.
In 2015, newly appointed head coach Ivaylo Petev reinstated Popov to the squad. The captain's band, however, went to midfielder Svetoslav Dyakov.

Northern Forest Canoe Trail

The Northern Forest Canoe Trail (NFCT) is a marked canoeing trail in the northeastern United States and Canada, extending from Old Forge in the Adirondacks of New York to Fort Kent, Maine. Along the way, the trail also passes through the states and provinces of Vermont, Quebec, and New Hampshire. The trail was opened on June 3, 2006.
Overview.
The trail has been likened to a water version of the Appalachian Trail, and there are many similarities: both are long-distance trails that most people will use for day trips or short overnight trips. Many of those who paddle the entire trail will do so in sections. Unlike the AT, the NFCT obtains access for campsites and portages through landowner permission rather than through land protection. Also, many sections of the trail require a high level of skill to complete.
The trail is divided into 13 sections: Adirondack Country (West) New York, Adirondack North Country (Central) New York, Adirondack Country (East) New York, Islands and Farms Region Vermont, Upper Missisquoi Valley Vermont/Quebec, Northeast Kingdom Quebec/Vermont, Great North Woods New Hampshire, Rangeley Lakes Region Maine, Flagstaff Region Maine, Greater Jackman Region Maine, Moosehead/Penobscot Region Maine, Allagash Region (South) Maine, and Allagash Region (North) Maine. Each of these sections has been mapped and documented in order to establish the trail.
Trail towns include Old Forge, Richford, Vermont, The Errol-Berlin Corridor, New Hampshire and Rangeley, Maine. In Maine it primarily traverses through the North Maine Woods region
The trail covers 58 lakes and ponds, 22 rivers and streams, and 63 "carries" (portages) totaling . On some sections of the trail, portage trails, campsites, and access areas are marked with Northern Forest Canoe Trail medallions, a yellow diamond with blue lettering.
The American Canoe Association has named the NFCT an ACA-Recommended Water Trail.

Through-paddlers.
, 175 people have "through-paddled" the trail — traveling the length of the trail in one expedition. In addition, ten other "section-paddlers" have completed it in multiple trips.
Nicole Grohoski and Thomas Perkins of Ellsworth, Maine were the first to officially through-paddle the trail in 2006, traveling the length of the trail in about 45 days. Donnie Mullen paddled the trail in 2000 before its official opening, taking about 55 days but doing so without the signs and maps that were available in 2015. One of the fastest thru-paddles was completed in 2012 by Elspeth Ronnander, Erik Peih and Emily Johnson. The trip took them 21 days, 3 hours and 45 minutes. More recently, finishing on June 17, 2024, Jake Sexton and Monty Fuss from Ohio completed an unsupported, self-propelled, end to end thru-paddle in just 17 days, 15 hours and 41 minutes.

Kiss merchandising

The American rock band Kiss has licensed a large amount of merchandising throughout their career. According to Sandra O'Loughlin in an article for "Brandweek" magazine, "Kiss has licensed its name to more than 3,000 product categories, from lunch boxes and comic books to credit cards and condoms to become nearly a one-billion-dollar brand."
Kiss have more pieces of merchandise and have generated more money from merchandise, than any other artist in the history of music. Bassist and co-founder Gene Simmons, who has been the most aggressive and ambitious member of the band in seeking merchandising deals, has voiced disregard for the portions of his fan base who disapprove of such merchandising. In his book "Sex Money Kiss," he states: "I think it's cool to see my face on a lunchbox. It's fun. I'm doing this for me. You don't have to buy one."
The list of Kiss-related products is not comprehensive, but this article lists the most notable in terms of success and scope.
In print.
Comic books.
In 1977 Marvel Comics published a magazine-format full-color comic book presenting the band as superheroes. Blood from each band member was drawn by a registered nurse, witnessed by a notary public, and poured into the vats of red ink used for printing the comic at Marvel's Borden Ink plant in Depew, New York. Marvel also published a second Kiss comic magazine in 1978, with much less fanfare. In 1997, Image comics began publishing Todd McFarlane's "", a much darker and mystical series than the previous Kiss comics. 31 issues were published between 1997 and 2000. In 2002, Dark Horse comics published a Kiss comic book authored by X-Men writer Joe Casey, which lasted for thirteen issues and ended production in 2004. On January 30, 2007, it was announced that the KISS Comics Group, a joint venture between Platinum Studios and the band, would launch a new comic, "KISS 4K", with an oversized $50 Destroyer Edition, at the Wizard World Los Angeles Convention in March and with an ongoing series to follow in May by writer Ricky Sprague and artist Kevin Crossley. "KISS 4K" ran for six issues and one special edition issue in 2008. In 2011 Kiss teamed up with popular comic series Archie for a four-part series, "Archie Meets Kiss".

Starting in 1997 and continuing to the present day, McFarlane Toys has manufactured several different series of action figures and figurines, ranging from the exaggeratedly demonic "" series of figures to the more realistic and representative "Alive!" series, depicting the band performing in their 1975 costumes. The Figures Toys company began to produce a new series of figurines in 2012. The first edition series was based upon the original Mego range, and three more series’ have been planned based around the "Sonic Boom", "Dressed to Kill" and debut self-titled album.

On the Howard Stern radio show, Gene Simmons said of the casket, "This is the ultimate Kiss collectible. I love livin’, but this makes the alternative look pretty damn good." Notable people to be buried in a Kiss Kasket include Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell and drummer Vinnie Paul.
Condoms.
In 2002 a line of Kiss condoms (entitled "Kiss Kondoms") entered the market, in varieties such as "Love Gun Protection", "Tongue Lubricated", and "Studded Paul".

Zimbabwean cricket team in South Africa in 2006–07

The Zimbabwean cricket team toured South Africa for three One-day Internationals and one Twenty20 match against Eagles from 13 to 20 September 2006.
South Africa won the series 3–0.
Zimbabwe were described by Independent Online as a side of "no more than club standard", and the tour was described by South African coach Mickey Arthur as "part of the training camp" for the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy.
Matches.
Tour match: Eagles v Zimbabweans.
Eagles won by nine wickets
Zimbabwe lost their last nine wickets for 24 runs, against a bowling attack including three former South Africa internationals in Johannes van der Wath, Roger Telemachus and Nicky Boje. Opener Davey Jacobs hit an unbeaten half-century in reply, as Eagles overcame the target of 104 inside 11.4 of the 20 allotted overs.
1st One-day International, 15 September.
Vusimuzi Sibanda top scored for Zimbabwe with his fifth One-day International half-century, as the only one to pass 40 in South Africa's innings. Justice Chibhabha and Hamilton Masakadza contributed 30s as Zimbabwe made it 137 for two after the 33rd over, but the last 17 provided runs at a slower rate as Jacques Kallis, Makhaya Ntini and Shaun Pollock kept the run rate when they bowled below three an over. Robin Peterson's five overs cost 35, however, and he was the least economical bowler of the match (excluding Hamilton Masakadza who didn't bowl a full over).
South Africa lost their first three wickets within 10 overs, scoring 33 as Loots Bosman, Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis, but a 121-run partnership between Boeta Dippenaar and J. P. Duminy left 48 runs from the remaining 17 overs. Despite wickets from Stuart Matsikenyeri and Ed Rainsford, South Africa made it through with five wickets to spare.
2nd One-day International (Replay), 18 September.
The Second ODI was initially scheduled to be played on 17 September but was abandoned without a ball being bowled. It was replayed on 18 September. Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to bat first. Chamu Chibhabha top scored for the tourists with 38 off 101 balls. Elton Chigumbura made 30 while Tafadzwa Mufambisi and Prosper Utseya contributed 20s as Zimbabwe were bundled out for 152 inside 50 overs. Andrew Hall was the pick of the South African bowlers picking up 3 wickets for 23 runs. Makhaya Ntini, Robin Peterson and Jacques Kallis picked up 2 wickets each.
Boeta Dippenaar was the first wicket to fall for South Africa in the 4th over. However Loots Bosman played aggressively to score 38 runs off just 29 balls hitting 2 sixes in the process. By the time Jacques Kallis fell, South Africa needed 43 runs from 184 balls. J. P. Duminy and Justin Kemp took South Africa home inside 30 overs. Andrew Hall was declared Man of the Match.
3rd One-day International, 20 September.
Zimbabwe were "beaten to their knees by a brutal display of power" that began with the openers Loots Bosman and Alviro Petersen before Mark Boucher came in and registered his first one-day century in his 220th match, and also the second quickest of all time. This was the fourth total of more than 400 in ODI history, and the second time in four games that South Africa scored more than 400. Both the openers scored 80s, and Bosman was the first to fall with the score on 160 in the 21st over. Captain Jacques Kallis scored a 50 off 59 balls. However it was Mark Boucher who turned out to be the hero of the day. He scored 147 off just 68 balls which included 10 sixes. Zimbabwe's "shoddy" fielding helped: he was dropped six times. Ed Rainsford was the only Zimbabwean bowler whose economy rate was below 6 runs per over, though Prosper Utseya and Tafadzwa Kamungozi picked up two wickets each but went for 77 and 70 runs respectively.
The match "effectively ended after the first innings", according to the Cricinfo report, as Zimbabwe batted out the 50 overs without losing wickets. Terry Duffin led the resistance with a defiant 87, supported by Chamu Chibhabha and Hamilton Masakadza, with whom he added 94 and 102 for the second and third wickets. Zimbabwe finished with 247 for 4, their highest total of the series, and their highest total against a top-eight nation (the Test nations excluding 10th-ranked Bangladesh), since May 2006.

The Stupids (film)

The Stupids is a 1996 adventure comedy film starring Tom Arnold and directed by John Landis. It is based on "The Stupids", characters from a series of books written by Harry Allard and illustrated by James Marshall. It was largely panned by critics and was a commercial failure.
The film follows the fictional family, the Stupids, with a last name synonymous with their behavior. The story begins with patriarch Stanley Stupid believing "sender" from letters marked "return to sender" is a wicked man planning a conspiracy. Adding several misunderstandings, they unwittingly save the world from military chaos, while believing a fake story about a fictional man named Sender and his plot to confiscate everyone's mail and garbage.
Plot.
Stanley and Joan Stupid are convinced they are victims of a conspiracy that steals their garbage every week. In an attempt to uncover this, Stanley follows the garbage truck to the city dump, where he stumbles across Colonel Neidermeyer, who is selling contraband weaponry to a group of terrorists. He believes Stanley to be a secret agent who has uncovered their operation and orders him assassinated, and after several attempts on his life result in him unintentionally killing his would-be assassins, he narrowly escapes a car bomb and is presumed dead by Neidermeyer.
Meanwhile, Stanley and Joan's children, Petunia and Buster, believe they have been kidnapped by a Chinese restaurant and go there in search of them. They reunite with Joan, who explains her theory that the police have turned against them and are responsible for Stanley being missing.
Once the Stupids are reunited at home, Joan tells Petunia and Buster about Stanley's last job for the postal service where he discovered all the letters being marked "return to sender", but was fired before he could find out who "Mr. Sender" was. He tells his family about the conspiracy theory he has invented that combines all the ideas their overactive imaginations have created, including the "Evil Mr. Sender" plotting to steal all the mail and garbage from America and employing the police to kidnap anybody who discovers his scheme. When they find local museum curator Charles Sender in the phone book they set off in pursuit of him, ultimately tracking him to a television studio where Stanley appears on a talk show and is spotted by Niedermeyer who has him kidnapped and brought to the army base.
While being held hostage at the army base, Stanley overhears the address of the warehouse being used for the illegal arms deals. Following an escape, the Stupids go there, where they expect to find Sender and the stolen mail. They confront Neidermeyer and his terrorist associates in a battle, resulting in some explosions that cause the police to investigate the warehouse. The associates are arrested but Neidermeyer escapes. Stanley offers what he perceives to be heroic advice about how Sender can repent his evil ways, but he takes them as road directions. The Stupids return home, only to find a vengeful Neidermeyer waiting for them, armed with a handgun. Luckily, just as he is about to kill them, he is knocked out from behind the front door by a deliveryman that Joan had called round earlier. In the end, the Stupids celebrate their success with an outdoor barbeque.
Production.
The film was shot in Toronto, Ontario (downtown shots) and Uxbridge, Ontario (Home located at 55 Quaker Village Drive, Uxbridge, Ontario).
Reception.
The film grossed $2,491,989 in the United States and Canada and £0.9 million in the United Kingdom from an estimated $25 million budget, and became Landis' weakest performing film.
The film opened to negative reviews. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave it a score of 20% based on 15 reviews, as of November 2017. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave it a grade of "C+" on a scale of A+ to F.
Bruce Fretts of "Entertainment Weekly" gave it a grade F, calling it "Guaranteed 100 percent laugh-free." Derek Elley of "Variety" wrote: "The problem with "The Stupids" is that it isn't stupid enough by half. Lacking both the sheer gross-out humor of "Dumb and Dumber" and the carefully thought-through tone of the Brady pics".
John Landis said that he was proud of the film: "I'm happy to say it's very successful on television, and extremely successful on video because people buy it for their kids. It's meant for ten-year-olds. That really went under the radar. But I really like that picture. And that one had a great score by Christopher Stone."
Accolades.
At the 1996 Golden Raspberry Awards and 1996 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, Arnold won Worst Actor for his performances in "Big Bully", "Carpool", and this film. For the Razzies, it was also nominated for the awards for Worst Picture, Worst Director (John Landis), and Worst Screenplay (Brent Forrester). For the Stinkers, it was also nominated for Worst Picture and Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy; it was also handpicked for the "Founders Award - What Were They Thinking and Why?" alongside "The Phantom".

Marchand Mission

The Marchand Mission was an expedition undertaken by French emissary Jean-Baptiste Marchand (1863-1934) and 150 men with designs to expand French colonial power in northeastern Africa.
Starting from Libreville (in present-day Gabon) in 1897, the Marchand expedition spent 14 arduous months crossing largely uncharted regions of north central Africa. They finally reached the fort of Fashoda on the upper Nile on July 10, 1898, and hoisted the French flag. On September 18, a flotilla of British gunboats led by Horatio Kitchener arrived at Fashoda; Kitchener had just defeated Mahdi forces at The Battle of Omdurman, and was in the process of reconquering the Sudan in the name of the Egyptian Khedive. The confrontation of the French and British was cordial but both sides insisted on their right to Fashoda.
News of the encounter was relayed to Paris and London and each side accused the other of expansionism and aggression. A stalemate (the Fashoda Incident) continued until November 3 when French Foreign Minister Théophile Delcassé, fearing the possibility of war, withdrew Marchand and his troops and ceded the Sudan to the British.
The Marchand Mission was a major French attempt during the great period of colonial expansion to link colonial territories across the breadth of Africa. Some 45,000 porters struggled over 2000 miles to achieve the conquest, carrying hundreds of tons of supplies.

Stephen Preston (flautist)

Stephen Preston (born 1945) is an English flautist specialising in period performance of baroque and classical music on original instruments. Additionally he plays modern flute and choreographs historical forms of dance.
Biography and career.
His professional career began while studying the flute at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama; he was a founder of the Galliard Trio (with Trevor Pinnock, harpsichord and Anthony Pleeth, cello), whose London debut was in 1966. He developed an interest in historical music performance practice and taught himself to play the baroque and classical flute, later going on to be a founder of many of London's leading period-instrument ensembles in the 1970s. He has had a prolific recording career, recording most of the major baroque works for flute, including Bach's complete flute sonatas with Trevor Pinnock, orchestral suite in B minor with The English Concert and Vivaldi's op.10 flute concertos with The Academy of Ancient Music. More recently, He worked as an advisor on historical performance practices with one of America's most eminent chamber ensembles, the New Century Saxophone Quartet on their highly praised recording of Bach's "Art of Fugue".
From 1981 to 2001, he worked as a choreographer, principally of historical dance in opera. He was director of two dance companies, one of which explored the relationship between contemporary and historical performance practices.
He lectures, teaches and coaches at some of Britain's leading music academies, the Royal College of Music, the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal Northern College of Music, Trinity College of Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, as well as giving regular master classes in the United States including Wildacres Flute Retreat in Little Switzerland, NC.
He now divides his time between research, teaching and performing. He is engaged in research into developing new techniques and improvisational forms based on birdsong, for which he received a PhD. From this work he has created a new musical language – ecosonics. An example of ecosonics can be heard in the BBC Singers commission "The Soft Complaining Flute", by composer Edward Cowie, written for flute and 6 sopranos. He now regularly performs in a baroque-flute duo (with Amara Guitry), Nodneeya. They perform "haunting Native American melodies; virtuosic pieces from the 19th century; authentic period arrangements of well-loved works by Mozart; and unique improvisations based on the 'duetting' songs of birds".
References to Stephen Preston as a flute player can be found in the "New Grove", J. Solum: "The Early Flute" and A. Powell: "The Flute".

Zoo Interchange

The Zoo Interchange is a freeway interchange on the west side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. It forms the junction of Interstate 94 (I-94, East–West Freeway), I-894, I-41, US Highway 41 (US 41) and US 45 (Zoo Freeway). It is the busiest and one of the oldest interchanges in the state. It is nicknamed as such because of the Milwaukee County Zoo located on the northwest quadrant of the interchange. The control cities at the interchange are Downtown Milwaukee to the east, Chicago to the south, Madison to the west and Fond du Lac to the north.
Originally completed in 1963, the interchange was a major component in the freeway system being developed in Milwaukee and southeastern Wisconsin and formed an important link with the Interstate Highway System. The design included exits on both the left and right sides of the roadways, and drivers exited depending which side their destination road was on. Owing to the dangers of this design and the deterioration of the interchange, a reconstruction was considered in the early 2000s. Plans set reconstruction in 2015, but it was advanced by Governor Jim Doyle to 2012, then delayed due to lack of available funding. Work finally began in 2014 with an expected completion in 2018. However, further budget issues delayed the completion (as of September 2018) until 2022.
The complexity and scale of the reconstruction project necessitated advanced methods of construction. It marked the first time that Wisconsin used drilled shaft foundations to build bridge supports and the first time that 3D computer modelling was used. In 2014 the interchange became the first place in the United States where orange pavement markings were tested.
The interchange reconstruction has sparked much controversy and political polarization. Opponents have criticized its extremely high $1.7 billion cost. It also continues the area trend of investing heavily in freeways while disinvesting in all other forms of transportation. This resulted in the Milwaukee Innercity Congregations Allied for Hope and the Black Health Coalition of Wisconsin filing a lawsuit against the department of transportation in 2012. It was resolved in 2014 with the state agreeing to give additional aid to the public transit system.
History.
Freeway system construction, post World War II to the 1960s.
Following the end of World War II, the city of Milwaukee began experiencing economic and population growth. Traffic on the city streets doubled from 1945 to 1952. Roads quickly became overloaded resulting in long delays and increased accidents. In 1951, the city hired consultants Amman and Whitney to do a traffic study and find a solution that would satisfy the city's needs for the increasing traffic. The firm recommended the construction of a freeway system, which was approved by the city in 1952 and began in 1953. A major component of the new highway system was the Zoo Interchange, located to the west of downtown. By the summer of 1963, work crews were in a rush to have the interchange finished by the end of that year's construction season, resulting in its completion that fall. The interchange formed a major connection between the Milwaukee area freeways and the rest of the Interstate Highway System, and its completion was regarded as a milestone for the Milwaukee highway system. Engineers had debated between a right-hand-only design and a directional design, but ultimately chose the directional. This design featured entrance and exit ramps on both sides, such that drivers going to a roadway on the left exited to the left and drivers going to a roadway on the right exited to the right. The maximum capacity was 115,000 vehicles per day.
Interchange rebuild proposal, 2003–2008.
By 2003, the freeways in Milwaukee and the greater southeastern Wisconsin area were approaching the end of their useful life. Following a study, the Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Committee presented several plans, with the recommended being to expand the system over the next 30 years. A key feature of the plan was to widen mainline freeways to include more lanes. It was claimed this would reduce the congestion problem. The plan also included numerous changes for interchanges, including the Zoo Interchange. The directional interchange style had become deprecated due to safety concerns and a lack of efficiency caused by vehicles that had to move across the highway in both directions. The plan therefore called for all exits to be relocated to the right side. It also suggested reducing lane endings at interchanges and reconfiguring ramps to allow for travel at a higher speed. WisDOT originally planned to begin working on the Zoo Interchange after a rebuild of I-94 from Milwaukee to the state line had been completed. This was estimated to be in 2015. However in 2006, Governor Jim Doyle announced a new plan to begin construction in 2012. Doyle stated that advancing the project would benefit the economy of the region and create new jobs. The new timeline called for an environmental and engineering study to occur from 2007 to 2008 and final design development and land acquisition to occur from 2009 to 2011. Doyle asked for $28 million (equivalent to $ in ) in the 2007–2008 budget to begin this process. The original estimate for the cost was $1.1 billion (equivalent to $ in ), although it was expected to go up to $2.6 billion (equivalent to $ in ). Residents worried that the advancement of the work would also advance a proposed plan to widen the freeway between the Zoo and Marquette interchanges, which was opposed by the neighborhoods that would be encroached upon. The advanced timeline of the Zoo Interchange was not expected to have an effect on other projects that it would now be happening concurrently with, including the rebuilding of the Marquette Interchange and the rebuild of I-94.
Preliminary planning and delay, 2008.
In 2008, the interchange handled a traffic volume of 345,900 vehicles per day, three times its original design capacity. The rate of accidents was two to three times higher than the state average. After concluding its engineering study, WisDOT announced three possible plans for the interchange. One option was to rebuild the interchange in place, keeping the design the same at a cost of $960 million (equivalent to $ in ). This would fix the deteriorating state of the infrastructure but would not do anything about the left-hand exits or traffic congestion. A second option was to do a full rebuild of the interchange, replacing outdated features to improve safety and widening it to six lanes, with a cost of $2.16 billion (equivalent to $ in ). The third option was a full rebuild with widening to eight lanes. The estimated cost was $2.31 billion (equivalent to $ in ). The department decided to eliminate the basic rebuild option as it would not address all of the problems. Area legislators favored the eight-lane expansion, as they believed it would prepare for future traffic needs. However, the state's 2009–2011 budget did not include enough money for the project. Only $20 million (equivalent to $ in ) was allocated while preparatory tasks including acquiring land, relocating utilities, and designing the first phase were estimated to cost $195 million (equivalent to $ in ). Governor Doyle backed off of his original plan, acknowledging that the state would not have enough money to do the Zoo Interchange until the I-94 reconstruction was completed. The estimated start date was moved to 2016.
Deficient bridges, 2009–2010.
An inspection in August 2009 found three bridges in the interchange to be structurally deficient. Weight restrictions were posted for the bridges and state troopers and sheriffs deputies were assigned to enforce them. However, the volume of traffic in the interchange made enforcement difficult, and sensors installed on one bridge recorded 1,600 overweight vehicles crossing the bridge every week. In December, WisDOT began bidding for a contract to replace the bridges. The only bid was submitted by Milwaukee Constructors LLC, a joint venture of three companies. Working with the contractor, the department developed plans to construct new bridges next to the old ones. Traffic would continue to use the old bridges until the new ones were completed. Following completion, traffic would be shifted to the new bridges. The project was estimated to cost $15.3 million (equivalent to $ in ). In March 2010, severe cracking was discovered on one of the deficient bridges. Several existing cracks had become longer and a new crack was found. The ramp that used the bridge was closed and traffic was detoured onto the city streets. The other bridges remained open. The closure was expected to affect 42,000 drivers per day and last for two months until the replacement bridge was completed.
Final planning and lawsuit, 2012–2014.
In February 2012, WisDOT announced the final design for the interchange. Due to public opposition to most of the options proposed, the department had taken components from several designs to develop the reduced impacts alternative, which was chosen. This design was a complete rebuild of the interchange, but with less land use and environmental impacts than other options. The estimated cost was $1.71 billion (equivalent to $ in ). Preliminary changes on surrounding roads would begin in 2013 to prepare them for expected increased traffic during the interchange work. The work on the interchange would begin in 2014. However, a lawsuit was filed in August 2012 attempting to rein in the capacity expansion component of the plan on the grounds that it would have a discriminatory effect. The plaintiffs, representing inner-city minorities, alleged that the money being spent on the interchange would only benefit people with cars, namely those who lived in the generally White suburbs, while negatively impacting inner-city minorities. A ruling in May 2013 required WisDOT to conduct a study on the effects of the interchange project on suburban sprawl and transit-dependent populations. Expansion of the highways on the approach to the Zoo Interchange were blocked from proceeding until the study was completed. The case continued to court-sanctioned mediation where a settlement was reached in May 2014. WisDOT agreed to pay $13.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) for public transit improvements in the region.
Core construction, 2014–2018.
The American Transmission Company began relocating overhead power lines in June 2013 in order to accommodate the new interchange design. Eight 138,000-volt wires over an stretch were relocated. By March 2014, work was under way on surface streets in the area. This included the widening of Wisconsin Highway 100 (WIS 100) and Watertown Plank Road. The contract for the first phase of the interchange core was awarded in August 2014. The lowest bid of $198.8 million (equivalent to $ in ) and was submitted by a joint venture of Lunda Construction Co., Michels Corporation, and Edgerton Contractors Inc. This was $28.6 million (equivalent to $ in ) lower than the only other bid submitted. Work on the core began in December 2014. Plans for the phase focused primarily on adding new lanes to the approaches to the core. In February 2015, Ryan Calkins, a construction worker for Michels Corp., was killed in an accident at the worksite. It was reported that he was trapped by heavy machinery. His death was the first on any of the major projects in the Milwaukee area. Bidding for the second phase of the core occurred in September 2015. The winning bid was $314 million (equivalent to $ in ), submitted by Walsh Construction, the company that had been beat in bidding for the first phase. A total of three bids were submitted. The contract included work until August 2018.
Core completion and north leg delay, 2018–2022.
The 2017–2019 state budget featured a decrease of $292 million (equivalent to $ in ) in the amount allocated for large highway projects in the Milwaukee region compared to the previous biennium's budget. Under this budget, completion of the north leg of the interchange was delayed by two years. This compounded on a two-year delay introduced in the previous budget, moving the completion date to 2022 from the originally planned 2018. The core of the interchange was still expected to be completed on time. In June 2018, the ramp from I-94 west to I-894 south opened, marking the completion of the last major structure in the core of the interchange. The ramp had been the first to close and remained so for three and a half years. After its reconstruction, the ramp became the tallest part of the interchange at . Finishing work on the core continued through August.
Design.
WisDOT proposed several possible courses of action and designs for the interchange reconstruction. The problems that a new design should address were identified as: the deteriorating condition of the interchange, the dangers of the left side exits, the volume of traffic using the interchange, and traffic volumes expected in the future.
No-build alternatives.
The no-build alternatives did not involve any construction work being done on the interchange. The first was to simply do nothing. This was eliminated because it did not solve any of the problems. The second was to improve public mass transit in the region. It included doubling the revenue miles of existing transit systems and establishing new transit systems. This would reduce traffic in the interchange, reducing congestion and extending the structure's life, but it was eliminated because it would not fix safety problems, nor address WisDOT's traffic volumes projections. The third alternative was to improve traffic management with HOV lanes, new driver messaging boards, increased patrols, and improved access to traffic information. This option was eliminated because it did not solve most of the problems.
Build alternatives.
The build alternatives involved construction work on the interchange. The first was to replace all of the roadways and structures in the interchange. This would solve the deterioration of the interchange, but would not fix safety or congestion problems, as it would retain the same design. The second option was to make spot improvements to the interchange. This would include repair or replacement of structures and pavement where necessary and reconfiguration of some service roads to improve access and safety. This was eliminated because it did not fix traffic congestion and did not fully solve all of the problems.
Modernization alternative.
The "modernization" alternatives involved completely rebuilding and reconfiguring the interchange to new standards. Two similar versions of a modernization design were proposed. These designs featured all exits on the right, full shoulders on all mainlines and ramps, two lanes on some ramps, and smoother curves to allow greater speed. The primary difference was the number of lanes through the interchange; one design had six, and the other had eight. The six-lane variant was eliminated because it was not expected to adequately handle future traffic volumes, as predicted by WisDOT. The eight-lane variant would theoretically solve all of the problems, and was favored by the department, but it faced opposition by the public because of high costs and environmental impacts. Following public hearings, this design was eliminated.
Reduced impacts alternative.
Based on input from the public, WisDOT took components from several of the eliminated designs to develop a new option, called the reduced impacts alternative. This design was still intended to solve all of the problems, but would have a lower cost, less environmental impact, and require significantly less property and utility relocations. The design would have only four lanes on I-94, but included shoulders that would allow it to be increased to six lanes in the future. The design also reduced the number of levels from five to four and eliminated a loop ramp. As the new design would not work with plans for the approach legs from other designs, reduced impacts alternative plans were also developed for each leg.
Construction methods.
The supports for the bridges were built using large diameter drilled shafts. The shafts were in diameter and deep. The Zoo Interchange was the first project in Wisconsin to use drilled shafts. The use of this method instead of pilings allowed for easier traffic rerouting, reduced installation time, less utility conflicts, less noise and vibrations, and cost savings.
The bridges were built with two side-by-side steel tub girders. This design allowed longer bridges to be built while using fewer lifts, as well as maintaining uniformity with the Marquette and Mitchell interchanges. Because of the of steel needed for the project, WisDOT held meetings with steel fabricators and construction contractors to understand the necessary logistics. It was determined that contractors would need to buy from at least two steel manufacturers to obtain the necessary quantity. A bill of materials was released in advance, giving contractors two to three months to obtain the steel before the work was scheduled to begin. Six 31-hour windows were scheduled for installing beams, and deliveries of beams were coordinated to occur during off-peak traffic times. The use of chainfalls to guide the beams into place and bigger cranes than expected reduced the time needed to install beams to 12–15 hours per window.
The project marked the first use of 3D modeling software by WisDOT. The department obtained laser mapping units, new desktop, laptop, and tablet computers, and GPS rovers in preparation of the project. Two terabytes of data were generated from surveying the site. Computer-generated models of the new interchange design could then be created. The models were uploaded to GPS rovers at the site which used them to search for any conflicts with utilities. Data collected by the rovers was then entered into the modeling software so conflicts could be resolved. Finished models were shared with contractors so they would not have to make their own. Model data was also used for automated machine guidance during construction.
Paint testing.
In December 2014, the Zoo Interchange became a test site for orange pavement markings. On December 2, white and yellow lines were replaced with orange lines at three places in the interchange. The testing was in response to reports of salt residue making lines in the work zone difficult to see in the winter. This was especially problematic where . Orange was chosen because it would be easier to see and matched the color of construction signs and barrels. This was the first time orange markings were used in the United States, although they had already been used successfully in other countries. The project required approval from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), which originally granted an 18-month test period. This was later extended through the end of the interchange construction. As orange paint would be hard for a contractor to find, and excess could not be used anywhere else, WisDOT decided to supply the paint to contractors. Orange epoxy paint was purchased from a manufacturer in Canada and used for the first test. However, by the end of the summer, the paint had faded to yellow. A water-based latex paint was tested next, but this was worn away during the winter. The department therefore decided to use latex paint in the summer and epoxy paint in the winter. Orange tape markings were also tested. A survey of drivers found that 75% liked the orange markings and 25% did not. It was reported that no decrease in worksite accidents was found as a result of the orange markings, but there also was not an increase.
Lawsuit.
Background.
In August 2012, a lawsuit was filed against the state and federal departments of transportation, alleging that the project was discriminatory. The suit was filed in the district court in Madison by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin and the Midwest Environmental Advocates on behalf of the Milwaukee Innercity Congregations Allied for Hope and the Black Health Coalition of Wisconsin. The plaintiffs argued that the huge amounts of money being spent on expanding the freeways at the interchange would only benefit commuters from the mainly White suburbs. Urban minorities, who generally did not have cars, would receive no benefit from the expenditure. Further, state aid to the public transit that these groups relied on had been decreasing. The results of these decreases included the Milwaukee County Transit System eliminating 25 bus routes and making reductions to other routes. The suit also argued that the expansion would increase air pollution. In the region, respiratory diseases from air pollution already had higher occurrence rates among minorities than Whites. The plaintiffs did not oppose the reconstruction of the interchange, but did not want any capacity expansion. They instead wanted the money allocated for expansion to be spent on improvements to public transit.
Preliminary ruling.
In May 2013, the court issued an interim ruling in the case. The ruling prevented construction from proceeding until studies on its effects had been completed. The court required the state to perform two studies. The first would look at the environmental effects of expanding the interchange's capacity, especially if future traffic volumes did not meet the state's estimate. The second would look at the social and economical effects on minorities of expanding the interchange's capacity while public transit remained unsupported. Both studies were expected to encompass the entire region. Once the studies were completed, the state would be free to choose whatever course of action it wanted, including continuing with the plan to expand the interchange and allow public transit to decline. However, the decision makers would be required to consider the results of the studies first. The defendant agencies challenged that the studies should only be required in the immediate area of the interchange. This argument was rejected by the court; they believed that the project could have effects on the entire region, not just the areas around the interchange, and the state needed to take these into consideration as well. As the ruling was interim, the case continued to court facilitated mediation before the suit was settled.
Resolution.
In May 2014, the two sides reached an agreement in mediation. Under the agreement, WisDOT would pay $13.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) over four years for transit services in the Milwaukee area. This would be allocated as $11.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) to develop and operate new bus routes, with a focus on routes designed to connect Milwaukee to its suburbs, and $2 million (equivalent to $ in ) to make enhancements to transit services. Following the settlement, the Milwaukee County Transit Committee began planning Route 279, a new express bus route that would run from central Milwaukee to Menomonee Falls. The new route would cost $245,000 in 2014 and $668,000 in 2015 (equivalent to $ and $ in ) and would be the first new route funded with the settlement money. After the four years of state funding, ridership on all the new routes would have to be analyzed to determine if it would be viable for the county to continue operating them.
Controversy and criticism.
The $1.7 billion dollar cost of rebuilding the interchange used two years worth of the state's budget for highway repairs and 15 years worth of public transit aid. It also resulted in a $250 million cut from the University of Wisconsin System and a decrease in aid for local road repairs. The choice to expand the capacity of the interchange greatly increased the cost, with a simple rebuild estimated at only $900 million.
Many residents opposed the plans made by WisDOT for arterial street widenings prior to the interchange reconstruction. Plans included expanding Blue Mound Road in Wauwatosa to ten lanes, including three through lanes and three left turn lanes. This would eliminate on street parking, which would present challenges to local businesses. The intersecting Mayfair Road would be increased to 11 lanes. Already considered one of the busiest in the state, the intersection would see a major increase in traffic volume. Area residents feared the increased traffic would create safety hazards and overflow into the surrounding neighborhoods. Similar expansion plans on Wisconsin Avenue would cut into residential properties along the street.
The city of Wauwatosa has suffered adverse effects from the volumes of traffic being diverted onto the city streets by the construction. The number of vehicles on the streets increased by between 63 and 109 percent from what it was before the construction. A 2016 survey conducted by the city found that residents were concerned by the amount of traffic. The higher traffic volumes increased wear on the streets and prevented the city from doing a rebuild of North Avenue. The delay of completion of the north leg has caused concern for city officials as it interfered with plans for work on North Avenue, requiring further postponement of improvements to the deteriorating road. In February 2017, the city council sent a letter to the state legislature requesting that the completion not be delayed. The traffic issues lead to the city rejecting an application from Chick-fil-A in the spring of 2023 to open a new restaurant on Mayfair Road in fear of that chain's unusually large overall traffic per location.
Politics.
The Zoo Interchange reconstruction has showcased the conflict of political ideas in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. Studies have found the area to be one of the most segregated in the country, with almost all minorities living in the city and the suburbs primarily White. Residents of the suburbs advocate in favor of highways while not supporting any other form of transportation. Residents of the city want a more diverse transportation system. The Republican suburbs have gained power in regional politics and pushed their transportation ideas, leading to proposals for bus lanes and several types of rail systems being vetoed. Following the bridge closure at the Zoo Interchange, county executive Scott Walker criticized Governor Doyle and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett for supporting an $810 million (equivalent to $ in ) rail line when the highway infrastructure was so deteriorated. After being elected governor, Walker allocated huge amounts of money to freeway megaprojects, exemplified by the $1.7 billion Zoo Interchange reconstruction. Residents of the city have complained that this is excessive, and the costs of the projects are not justified by the claimed few minutes of time saved by car commuters, especially while local road aid and education have received funding cuts. The city's opposition to the highway only idea of the suburbs culminated with the 2012 lawsuit, forcing the state to give more money to public transit.
In 1997, Milwaukee County legislators attempted to create a compromise that would support both transportation visions. An extensive study of numerous options revealed that legislators were divided into two distinct groups. One wanted only freeways, the other wanted only alternative transit options. A $1.86 billion (equivalent to $ in ) deal was proposed that would benefit both groups. It would give $460 million (equivalent to $ in ) to rebuild the Marquette Interchange and $610 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the Zoo Interchange and other I-94 improvements. It would also give $250 million (equivalent to $ in ) for constructing HOV and bus lanes, $444 million (equivalent to $ in ) for a light rail system, and $90 million (equivalent to $ in ) to improve bus service. Under this plan, the Marquette Interchange would have been rebuilt from 2001 to 2004, the light rail would have been constructed from 2002 to 2006, and the Zoo Interchange rebuild and other freeway work would have occurred from 2008 to 2013. However, disputes arose about how each component of the project would be paid for, with each group trying to block funding for the other's concessions. The compromise eventually fell apart and each group began to work individually to push their own agenda.

Timeform

Timeform is a sports data and content provider located in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. Founded in 1948, it provides systematic information on form to punters and others involved in the horse racing industry. The company was purchased by the sports betting exchange Betfair in December 2006. Since 2 February 2016, it has been owned by Flutter Entertainment.
History.
Portway Press Ltd was formed in 1948 by Phil Bull, who wanted to establish a mathematical link to a horse's performance, based on the time the horse recorded. At a time when such data was virtually unheard of, Bull started publishing a racing annual, which evolved into the "Racehorses Of.." series. The company was purchased for a reputed £15 million by the sports betting exchange Betfair in December 2006.
Data system.
According to Timeform, one of its ratings represents "the merit of the horse expressed in pounds and is arrived at by careful examination of its running against other horses using a scale of weight for distance beaten which ranges from around 3 lb a length at five furlongs and 2 lb a length at a mile and a quarter to 1 lb a length at two miles".
Timeform ratings for three-year-olds and up on the Flat:
Timeform states that the very poorest horses may be rated as low as 30, with the very best horses rated 130 and above. Two-year-old ratings are slightly lower than those for older horses. It also notes that only a very select number of horses have achieved a rating of 175 and above for hurdling (16) or 182 and above for chasing (20).
Flat vs hurdle vs steeplechase.
Timeform maintains different scales for horses racing on the flat, over hurdles and over fences. The scores cannot be compared for the obvious differences between the race types. For instance, Arkle at 212, Flyingbolt at 210, Sprinter Sacre at 192 are then followed by Mill House and Kauto Star, both at 191, are the highest rated steeplechasers. The highest rated horses over hurdles are Night Nurse at 182, Istabraq and Monksfield, both at 180, and Persian War at 179. The table below lists scores for flat horses only starting with the highest, rated at 147 which is the British horse Frankel.
Publications.
Annually in March, the company puts out its book "Racehorses of ...", which currently contains more than 1,200 pages and provides information and ratings on the top flat horses in Australasia, Dubai, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, North America and Scandinavia. Also, annually in October the company publishes "Chasers and Hurdlers", a thorough review of every horse that ran under National Hunt rules in Britain, as well as the best National Hunt horses to have run in Ireland and France.
Timeform publishes a number of other books. Its "Horses to Follow: Flat Season" is composed of short essays on fifty horses deemed worthy of following in the upcoming year's classics. The horses are selected by Timeform's own team of experts along with five leading broadcasters. The book also provides a guide to the most significant two-year-old performances from the previous year.
Timeform also compiles a system based on speed and class which appears in the Daily Racing Form for all horse racing events run in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and the United Arab Emirates.
Top-rated Thoroughbreds on flat courses.
The figures below are the official all-time highest rankings for horses who raced in Australia, Dubai, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan and Scandinavia, as supplied by Neil O'Connor of Timeform. Until very recently (approximately 2000), horses who raced exclusively in America were never given Timeform ratings, so they can not be compared directly to their European counterparts.

Dauntsey Vale

The Dauntsey Vale is a geographical feature in the north of the English county of Wiltshire.
It is characterised by a wide, flat, clay floodplain of the upper reaches of the Bristol Avon river, which divides the Cotswolds to the west from the chalk downland of east and south Wiltshire. It is triangular in shape with its north edge running from the town of Royal Wootton Bassett in the east to Malmesbury in the west. This prominent north ridge is the setting for the village of Brinkworth, which at five miles long, claims to be the longest village in England.
The western edge of the Vale is the edge of the Cotswolds, running from Malmesbury to Chippenham in the south. This edge is less pronounced than the classic escarpment which forms the western edge of the Cotswolds. It is characterised by a gradual drop in level, but more in the different building materials of the villages. For instance, Stanton St Quintin above the Vale has a distinct Cotswolds feel with the typical honey-coloured building stone and roof slates, while villages just a few miles away to the east like Christian Malford and Sutton Benger have typically thatched homes.
The eastern edge of the Vale is more pronounced, with a steep and high hill forming a ridge running from Wootton Bassett in the north to close to Calne in the south. This ridge top provided the site for RAF Lyneham, the home until 2011 of the RAF's Hercules transport planes.
It takes its name from the village of Dauntsey in the centre of the Vale.
Agriculture and land use.
The Dauntsey Vale, with its wet and lush green fields, is traditionally dairy pasture land. It was once a major milk and cheese producing area. Today, much dairy survives but is increasingly being replaced by arable farming, some sheep grazing and especially equestrian use.
Transport.
With its flat and steady descent, the Dauntsey Vale has since the Industrial Revolution been used as a major route to cross southern England, providing a manageable descent from the chalk highlands of eastern Wiltshire to Bath and Bristol below.
The first to do so was the Wilts and Berks Canal, whose course hugged the foot of the eastern ridge.
Brunel then used the Vale for the first Great Western Railway line from London to Bath and Bristol, which was followed by the line to South Wales in 1901, which diverges from the earlier line at Royal Wootton Bassett.
Finally, the M4 motorway descends across the Vale from north east to south west, and cuts through the lesser eastern Cotswolds scarp at Stanton St Quintin.
Notable people.
Mathilda Heath, a 15th-century philanthropist with connections to Bristol shipping, lived at East Tytherton, near Chippenham. She funded construction of an elaborate and lengthy causeway from her village to Chippenham to provide a safe and dry route, and gave money to trustees for its future upkeep. Much of Maud Heath's Causeway survives, particularly where it crosses the Avon. A statue of her was erected on the eastern scarp overlooking the vale above East Tytherton in Victorian times.
Captain Mark Phillips, first husband of Princess Anne, The Princess Royal, and father to Peter Phillips and Zara Phillips, had his ancestral home at Great Somerford.

Egyptian wolf

The Egyptian wolf (Canis lupaster lupaster) or the Egyptian jackal is a subspecies of African golden wolf native to northern, eastern and a part of western Africa.
Taxonomic and evolutionary history.
The Egyptian wolf had an unresolved taxonomic identity and was formerly known as the Egyptian jackal. Throughout much of the 20th century, the animal was classed as a subspecies of golden jackal, "Canis aureus lupaster". Notice was however taken by numerous zoologists of the animal's morphology, which corresponds more to that of the grey wolf. This was corroborated through mtDNA studies, which initially indicated that the animal was a subspecies of grey wolf, and should be renamed African wolf ("Canis lupus lupaster").
In 2015, both golden jackals from Africa and Eurasia were found to represent distinct monophyletic lineages separated for more than one million years, sufficient to merit formal recognition as different species: "C. aureus" (Eurasian golden jackal) and "C. lupaster" (African golden wolf). It has not been formally recognised as such by MSW3 which, published in 2005, classifies it as a subspecies of golden jackal.
Physical descriptions.
The Egyptian wolf differs from the Senegalese wolf by its heavier build, wider head, thicker fur, longer legs, more rounded ears, and shorter tail. The fur is darker than the golden jackal's, and has a broader white patch on the chest. Field observations in Senegal's Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary indicate that it is a solitary animal that lives on the periphery of Senegalese wolf territories, and dominates the latter species in disputes over carcasses.
Biology and behavior.
According to shepherds in Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary, while the Senegalese wolf preys primarily on lambs, the Egyptian wolf attacks larger prey, such as sheep, goats and cattle.
Habitat and distribution.
The Egyptian wolf inhabits a number of different habitats; in Algeria it lives in Mediterranean, coastal and hilly areas (including hedged farmlands, scrublands, pinewoods and oak forests), while populations in Senegal inhabit tropical, semi-arid climate zones including Sahelian savannahs. "Lupaster" populations in Mali have been documented in arid Sahelian massifs.
Relationship with humans.
The animal head of the Egyptian god Anubis may have been based on the African wolf, rather than the golden jackal as was formerly believed.

Carleton J. King

Carleton James King (June 15, 1904 – November 19, 1977) was an attorney and politician from Saratoga Springs, New York. A Republican, he was most notable for his service as District Attorney of Saratoga County, New York from 1950 to 1960, and a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1961 to 1974.
A native of Saratoga Springs, King graduated from Albany Law School in 1926, was admitted to the bar, and practiced in Saratoga Springs. He became active in politics and government as a Republican, and served as acting city court judge of Saratoga Springs from 1936 to 1941. In 1936, he was an unsuccessful candidate for Congress. In 1942, King was appointed Deputy District Attorney of Saratoga County, and he served until 1950. In 1950, King won election as district attorney, and he served until resigning at the end of 1960 to assume his seat in the Congress.
In 1960, King won election to the U.S. House. He was reelected six times and served from January 1961 until resigning in December 1974. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1974, and resigned a few days before the end of his final term.
In retirement, King resided in Florida. He died in Bradenton, Florida on November 19, 1977. His remains were cremated and scattered in the Gulf of Mexico.
Early life.
King was born in Saratoga Springs, New York on June 15, 1904, the son of James Henry King and Anna Louise (Rose) King. He graduated from Albany Law School in 1926. He was a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, and at graduation received the Corporation Prize, which was awarded to the student with the highest class standing in corporation law.
Career.
After attaining admission to the bar in 1926, King practiced law in Saratoga Springs. In 1936, he was a candidate for Congress, but lost the Republican nomination to E. Harold Cluett. From 1936 to 1941, he was acting judge of the Saratoga Springs municipal court.
King was an assistant district attorney of Saratoga County, New York from 1942 until 1950. In 1950, he was elected district attorney, and he served until resigning at the end of 1960 so he could begin the Congressional term to which he had been elected earlier that year. In 1955, King served as president of the New York State District Attorneys Association.
In November 1957, leaders of organized crime in New York held a planning conference now known as the Apalachin meeting, which was interrupted by police. In response, Governor Averell Harriman appointed five District Attorneys, including King, to advise him on new legislation. In February 1958, the district attorneys recommended creation of a special rackets bureau within the New York State Police.
U.S. Congressman.
He was elected to Congress in 1960, and was reelected six times. He served from January 3, 1961, until his resignation on December 31, 1974. He unsuccessfully ran for re-election in 1974, and lost to Democratic nominee Edward W. Pattison, a victory attributed to the wave election that favored Democrats as voters responded to Republican involvement in the Watergate scandal.
King was recognized as a member of the Republican Party's conservative wing. In 1962, he proposed an across-the-board income tax of at least 25 percent. In addition, King argued that individual and corporate tax rates should not be higher than 47 percent. During his Congressional service, King served on the United States Naval Academy board of visitors.
Later life.
In 1975, King was appointed to the board of visitors of the United States Military Academy. In retirement, he resided in Florida. He died in Bradenton, Florida on November 19, 1977. King was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Gulf of Mexico near Bradenton.
Family.
In 1933, King married Constance M. Roddy of Brooklyn. They were the parents of two children, son Carleton J. King Jr. and daughter Constance King, the wife of James A. Murphy Jr.

Pressing On (Relient K song)

"Pressing On" is a song by the Christian rock band Relient K. It was released as the second single from their second studio album, "The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek". The song was written by the band's lead singer Matt Thiessen.
Background and composition.
Following the release of their debut self-titled studio album, the group decided to show more growth and maturity in their songs from "The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek", as heard on "Pressing On". The song is about growth in faith, while also making a reference to pop culture, where the last line of the song is from "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" theme.
"Pressing On" was written by Matt Thiessen and produced by Mark Lee Townsend. The song was mixed by J.R. McNeely at the Castle in Nashville, while Ted Jensen mastered the track at Sterling Sound in New York City.
An acoustic version appears on "The Creepy EP", along with the studio version.
Critical reception.
Jesus Freak Hideout ranked the song at twentieth on their "Relient K's Top 20 Songs" list, writing, "Fast and loose punk rock with an ounce of maturity, this is a fun one that features a nice vocal breakdown to slow the pace before racing to its end."
Use in media.
The song was featured in the "Power Rangers Ninja Storm" episode "Looming Thunder", along with "Trademark" from "Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do". It also appears in "Big Air Freestyle", a motocross video game for GameCube and can be heard on at least one episode of the television show "Pimp My Ride". The song is featured in the episode of "What's New, Scooby Doo?" called "Gold Paw."
Music video.
A music video for "Pressing On" was released in 2001. The music video shows the at-the-time four band members as they walked from a van to a building where their video is to be shot. However, the band is instantly swamped by fans. Security guards desperately try to keep the fans away, but the band continues to look forward and walk towards the building anyway. Once they are inside, another fan who awaits them charges in their direction. Two more security guards take the man away as the band shows up on set. An extra scene is added at the end, where the director refers to their music as "Whatever you guys are playing these days". The music video also has many shots of the band performing the song, which are cut into the scenes of them walking through the fans.
The group was originally set to record a music video for another song, "Sade Hawkins Dance" in July 2001 and was supposed to feature Gary Coleman in the video. However, on a post to their official message board, Thiessen admitted that the band had to change to "Pressing On" at the last minute because of a low budget. Having only several days to plan the video, it was pulled together very quickly.
The video is also included on the gold edition of "The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek".

The Clitheroe Kid

The Clitheroe Kid was a BBC Radio comedy show featuring diminutive Northern comic Jimmy Clitheroe in the role of a cheeky schoolboy, who lived with his family at Lilac Avenue in an unnamed town in the North of England. The pilot show, pilot series, and 16 subsequent series, totalling 290 episodes in all, were originally broadcast between April 1957 and August 1972.
Cast.
In addition to Clitheroe himself, the show's stars included Peter Sinclair playing his Scottish granddad, Patricia Burke as his mother (in some early shows the part was played by Renée Houston), and Diana Day as his long-suffering sister, Susan (the sister, originally called Judith Clitheroe, was played in the earliest episodes by Judith Chalmers). Jimmy's father never appeared, and his absence was never addressed.
Oldham comedian Danny Ross played Alfie Hall, Susan's half-witted, tongue-tied boyfriend, who was often drawn into Jimmy's reckless schemes. He joined the show in 1960, replacing Susan's original boyfriend, played by Peter Goodwright.
Tony Melody played Mr (Horatio) Higginbottom (his first name was almost never used), normally known as "Higgie", a taxi driver — Granddad's drinking buddy, and father of Jimmy's pal Ozzie. Higginbottom was always threatening to give Jimmy a good hiding for things he had done to Ozzie. Ozzie himself was rarely heard, save as an indistinct background voice in occasional early episodes (such as "The Trouble with Higginbottom").
Several actors regularly played supporting roles in the show, including Leonard Williams (who played both Mr Craythorpe and Harry Whittle until 1962), Brian Trueman (who played Harry Whittle from 1966), and Rosalie Williams. Deryck Guyler, who had appeared in supporting roles in some early episodes, spent two years as a regular on the show, replacing Leonard Williams after the latter's death.
Famous guest stars included John Laurie, later best known as Private Fraser in "Dad's Army", playing Grandad's Scottish brother, Angus, and Mollie Weir as Angus's wife (she was well known on radio from "ITMA" and "Life with the Lyons"), who appeared together on at least two occasions every year from 1962 until 1970.
The lost 1956 pilot episode guest starred Irene Handl and Robert Moreton, as Jimmy's aunt and uncle, with Anthea Askey as his girl cousin (playing the roles which would eventually evolve into his Mother, Grandfather and Sister), and Eddie Leslie.
In the 1957 pilot series, actors who appeared in guest roles included John Broadbent, Violet Carson, Fred Fairclough, Fred Ferris, Tom Harrison, Jack Howarth, Shirley King, Eddie Leslie, Bob Monkhouse, Herbert Smith, Jack Watson, and Patrick Wells.
Of the 290 broadcasts aired between 1956 and 1972, the BBC has retained 57 complete tapes (in the BBC Sound Archive and at BBC Manchester), together with edited BBC Transcription Service vinyl discs preserving a further 118 episodes, making 175 recordings in all. However, almost no complete episodes exist prior to 1st January 1970 (i.e. from the Pilot series and Series 1 to 13).
For the period 1956 to 1969, supplementing the edited Transcription Service discs, 58 episodes are currently known to exist as off air recordings made by listeners, many of variable sound quality, some of which are incomplete. An on-going project exists to locate and restore the approximately sixty entirely missing episodes, for which no recording of any sort is known, and to locate better quality and more complete recordings for the others.
Production.
Jimmy Clitheroe was 35 years old when he started playing the part on radio, but (in the variety theatres and, later, on television) he could pass as an 11-year-old boy because he had never grown physically beyond that age. Although in later years his lined face gave his real age away, this was not apparent on radio.
Created by James Casey in 1956, the show was produced in Manchester, originally by the North Region studios of the BBC Home Service. However, after two series were aired on North Region only, in 1959 the show was deemed sufficiently popular to be moved to the national transmitters of the BBC Light Programme.
The radio show was recorded in front of a studio audience, and there were frequently gales of laughter at Clitheroe's schoolboy humour, or at Alfie Hall's mangling of the English language as he tried to explain something, only to make it even less clear, as well as (to the mystification of home listeners) Hall's physical comedy, when he performed one of his trademark falls or other sight-gags.
Clitheroe always wore a schoolboy blazer and cap in the role, even at radio recordings, to maintain the illusion that he was 11-years-old. In the beginning (and, in fact, for many years), his high-pitched voice sounded astonishingly young. Real children never appeared on the show, as this would have shattered the carefully crafted illusion that he was a child (the show's popularity overseas arose, in part, because audiences unfamiliar with British showbusiness believed he really "was" a child). So he discussed his pal Ozzie, and his schoolboy friends in the "Black Hand Gang" (who would punish any member caught in the company of a girl), but the characters he spoke about were never actually heard themselves.
The show (apart from the 1957 pilot series) was written by James Casey and Frank Roscoe (occasionally by Ronnie Taylor, who had written the pilot series), and from 1958 was also produced by James Casey.
Following transmission, the BBC mainly preserved the series as 154 recordings on vinyl discs, sold overseas to Commonwealth radio stations by their commercial arm, BBC Enterprises (currently trading as BBC Worldwide and BBC Radio International). Altogether, the BBC retains 175 episodes, as a mixture of complete original recordings on magnetic tape and 25 minute edits on vinyl disc.
Plot elements.
Misunderstandings are the essence of the character-driven plots. Jimmy is depicted as frequently eavesdropping, or listening at keyholes, and as mishearing or misunderstanding what he overhears. Even when trying to do a good deed (as when he believes Grandad has stolen money from a local shop, which he is actually only minding for the bowling club), he usually messes up, with the assistance of the disaster-prone Alfie.
Another frequent scenario is some variation on one of Jimmy's many money-making schemes, intended to finance another visit to the sweetshop, or the purchase of a new pair of roller-skates, or somesuch, but which inevitably leads to disaster.
Jimmy's comedy technique involves much use of a popular style known (then as now) as "insult humour". He refers to his teachers by comic nicknames, such as "Hum-ya Pete", "Whistling Willie" and "Tick-Tock Tillie". Mr Higginbottom is frequently likened to a rampaging grizzly-bear. Grandad's Scottish ancestry is endlessly mocked, with much talk of haggis and playing the bagpipes in the bath, and he is portrayed as a man who lives only for his beer. Jimmy's sister, Susan, is typically referred to as "Scraggy-neck", "Sparrow-legs", or occasionally "the Octopus" (for her clinches with boyfriend Alfie).
Alfie is endlessly mocked also — often countering by threatening to thump Jimmy. It is Alfie who Jimmy refers to in his catchphrase, "Don't some mothers 'ave 'em!?" Mr Higginbottom is also mocked whenever he appears: among other things, his house is said to be a rat-infested dump. However, Jimmy treads carefully in this, because the bad-tempered Higginbottom is known for his hair-trigger temper. Higginbottom's son, the much-maligned Ozzie, is a fat kid who Jimmy calls his best friend, while frequently thrashing him, mocking him, and involving him in his wild schemes.
The one person who escapes Jimmy's ready wit is his mother. In real life, his father had died and he was devoted to his widowed mother, so he would not stand for either his real mother, or his radio mother, being mocked. She is the calm centre around which the chaos revolves.
Susan occasionally turns the tables on her "little brother" (Jimmy was only ), in return. In the episode "Enough to Make a Kitten Laugh", Susan tricks Jimmy into buying back a lost kitten that he had sold to Ozzie, by offering a reward for it in the local newspaper (under an assumed name), but warns Mr Higginbottom that Jimmy wants it back, so that he has to pay double what Ozzie had paid him. When Jimmy discovers the trick, however, he gets the last laugh, selling the kitten (at a profit) to an employee at the newspaper, who then turns up at home to demand the reward she's offered.
After the end credits, Jimmy would usually deliver a short epilogue, addressed to the audience, tying up loose ends in the plot and, frequently, reporting that Grandad has given him the (expected) good spanking for the trouble he caused.

Stéphane Gendron

Stéphane Gendron (born December 22, 1967) was the mayor of Huntingdon, Quebec, Canada, from 2003 to 2013 and a radio host, a television host and a political analyst for several media outlets.
Early life and education.
He was born in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and raised in nearby Saint-Rémi in the Montérégie.
Gendron is a graduate of Collège Jean de la Mennais in La Prairie and has a law degree from the Université de Montréal and master's degree in history from the University of Massachusetts Lowell.
Career.
Prior to his political and media career, Gendron practised law and taught at the CEGEP level. He was also a political aide to former Parti Québécois politician Jean Garon.
Mayor of Huntingdon.
Gendron was elected Mayor of Huntingdon in November 2003 and was re-elected without opposition for a four-year term in November 2005, and re-elected in November 2009. He stepped down from municipal politics at the end of his mandate in November 2013.
Controversy.
Youth curfew.
Gendron first gained media attention by enacting a municipal curfew forcing minors to stay off the street after 10 p.m. in Huntingdon, in an attempt to reduce juvenile crime. Following threats of litigation, the municipal council withdrew the proposed curfew. It was later discovered that the authors of the crime spree were, in fact, both adults.
Jean Charest.
In 2005, he claimed that Quebec premier Jean Charest was a "murderer" ("meurtrier") for his government's initial refusal to subsidize Herceptin, a new drug against breast cancer; he later apologized for these comments after being served legal papers.
Israel/Nazi analogy.
Gendron has courted controversy for his statements about the state of Israel. During the Israel/Lebanon war of 2006, he stated in an interview with "Le Soleil" that Israelis are modern-day Nazis ("Les Israéliens, ce sont les nazis des temps modernes"); he later clarified that was referring to the current Government of Israel, but stated that it was not exaggerated to compare that government with the Nazis.
Statement that Israel ‘does not deserve to exist’.
In December 2011, Gendron was criticized for a broadcast of his show "Face à Face" in which he stated that “Products made in Israel on land stolen from the Palestinians that is walled in, in an apartheid regime where they are cut off, it’s very serious... And a country like that does not deserve to exist.” The remarks sparked outrage from Jewish groups after a clip of the show was posted on YouTube by HonestReporting Canada, a website that monitors the media for anti-Israel bias. The California-based Simon Wiesenthal Center has since launched a protest against the network demanding Mr. Gendron's show be cancelled. In response, Gendron stated that he was not promoting hate speech against Jews or Israel, but rather taking issue with the country's politics, writing in an email that “I am defending a state with both Palestine and Israel living together, I may be naive, but this is my position. Israel as it is today is not my cup of tea.”
Stephen Harper.
On January 12, 2009, Stéphane Gendron insulted Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper in a letter that he also posted on his blog. for his support of Israel during the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict.
Allegations of harassment.
In January 2009, Stéphane Gendron was accused by Huntingdon town councillor Tonya Welburn of criminal and sexual harassment over an 18-month period. A complaint has been lodged with the Quebec Human Rights Commission. Same thing for criminal accusations. This chapter is directly related to a fight led by a former Member of the National Assembly for Huntingdon. Tonya Welburn lost her seat during the general election of November 2009, as well as her father who was also a councillor but running for mayor. Gendron got close to 66% of the popular vote. Gendron denied the accusation.
Animal cruelty.
Stéphane Gendron claimed that he enthusiastically ran over cats with his pickup truck on his radio show, which aired on July 9, 2013, on CHOI 91.9 Radio X. His comments were denounced by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and a petition was launched that demanded he be investigated. He later apologized for his comments, claiming he had exaggerated. He also claimed it was dark humour that was taken too seriously and out of context by animal advocacy groups.
Career in the media.
Gendron hosted the current affairs TV show "L'Avocat et le diable" on the TQS network, but was fired after the network received several complaints from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commissionfor several controversial comments. He later hosted a radio show on Montreal-based station 98,5 FM from March 2005 until March 2007. He now hosts the program "Sans Compromis" on XM Satellite Radio's Radio Parallèle.
Gendron is a regular columnist with the "Journal de Montréal" daily newspaper. He was also a TV commentator with the daily program "Le Show du Matin" on Channel V. He is also a regular radio commentator in Eastern Québec (La Pocatière, Rivière-d-Loup, Rimouski and St-Georges). He co- hosts a show called "Face a Face" on Channel V
Provincial and federal politics.
In February 2007, Gendron declined a bid to run for the Parti Québécois in his hometown riding of Huntingdon, claiming family reasons and the wish to complete his term as mayor. During the 2007 Quebec general election, he supported the Action démocratique du Québec party. In April 2008, Gendron called for Mario Dumont's resignation, claiming that he is especially disappointed with the way the ADQ leader has handled the immigration issue since becoming Leader of the Opposition.
At once, Gendron was approached by the Conservative Party of Canada to be a candidate for the federal election of 2008. He declined the offer, distanced himself from the party's foreign policy and endorsed the Bloc Québécois.
Following the ADQ's disappointing results in the 2008 election, Gendron expressed an interest in running for the party leadership in the event of Dumont's resignation.

Constant-weight code

In coding theory, a constant-weight code, also called an m"-of-"n" code or m"-out-of-"n" code, is an error detection and correction code where all codewords share the same Hamming weight.
The one-hot code and the balanced code are two widely used kinds of constant-weight code.
The theory is closely connected to that of designs (such as "t"-designs and Steiner systems). Most of the work on this field of discrete mathematics is concerned with "binary" constant-weight codes.
Binary constant-weight codes have several applications, including frequency hopping in GSM networks.
Most barcodes use a binary constant-weight code to simplify automatically setting the brightness threshold that distinguishes black and white stripes.
Most line codes use either a constant-weight code, or a nearly-constant-weight paired disparity code.
In addition to use as error correction codes, the large space between code words can also be used in the design of asynchronous circuits such as delay insensitive circuits.
Constant-weight codes, like Berger codes, can detect all unidirectional errors.
"A"("n", "d", "w").
The central problem regarding constant-weight codes is the following: what is the maximum number of codewords in a binary constant-weight code with length formula_1, Hamming distance formula_2, and weight formula_3? This number is called formula_4.
Apart from some trivial observations, it is generally impossible to compute these numbers in a straightforward way. Upper bounds are given by several important theorems such as the first and second Johnson bounds, and better upper bounds can sometimes be found in other ways. Lower bounds are most often found by exhibiting specific codes, either with use of a variety of methods from discrete mathematics, or through heavy computer searching. A large table of such record-breaking codes was published in 1990, and an extension to longer codes (but only for those values of formula_2 and formula_3 which are relevant for the GSM application) was published in 2006.
1-of-"N" codes.
A special case of constant weight codes are the one-of-"N" codes, that encode formula_7 bits in a code-word of formula_8 bits. The one-of-two code uses the code words 01 and 10 to encode the bits '0' and '1'. A one-of-four code can use the words 0001, 0010, 0100, 1000 in order to encode two bits 00, 01, 10, and 11. An example is dual rail encoding, and chain link used in delay insensitive circuits. For these codes, formula_9 and formula_10.
Some of the more notable uses of one-hot codes include
biphase mark code uses a 1-of-2 code;
pulse-position modulation uses a 1-of-"n" code;
address decoder,
etc.
Balanced code.
In coding theory, a balanced code is a binary forward error correction code for which each codeword contains an equal number of zero and one bits. Balanced codes have been introduced by Donald Knuth; they are a subset of so-called unordered codes, which are codes having the property that the positions of ones in a codeword are never a subset of the positions of the ones in another codeword. Like all unordered codes, balanced codes are suitable for the detection of all unidirectional errors in an encoded message. Balanced codes allow for particularly efficient decoding, which can be carried out in parallel.
Some of the more notable uses of balanced-weight codes include
biphase mark code uses a 1 of 2 code;
6b/8b encoding uses a 4 of 8 code;
the Hadamard code is a formula_11 of formula_12 code (except for the zero codeword),
the code;
etc.
The 3-wire lane encoding used in MIPI C-PHY can be considered a generalization of constant-weight code to ternary -- each wire transmits a ternary signal, and at any one instant one of the 3 wires is transmitting a low, one is transmitting a middle, and one is transmitting a high signal.
"m"-of-"n" codes.
An "m"-of-"n" code is a separable error detection code with a code word length of "n" bits, where each code word contains exactly "m" instances of a "one". A single bit error will cause the code word to have either or "ones". An example "m"-of-"n" code is the 2-of-5 code used by the United States Postal Service.
The simplest implementation is to append a string of ones to the original data until it contains "m" ones, then append zeros to create a code of length "n".
Example:
Some of the more notable uses of constant-weight codes, other than the one-hot and balanced-weight codes already mentioned above, include
Code 39 uses a 3-of-9 code;
bi-quinary coded decimal code uses a 2-of-7 code,
the 2-of-5 code,
etc.

Zanzibar City

Zanzibar City or Mjini District, often simply referred to as Zanzibar ("Wilaya ya Zanzibar Mjini" or "Jiji la Zanzibar" in Swahili) is one of two administrative districts of Mjini Magharibi Region in Tanzania. The district covers an area of . The district is comparable in size to the land area of Nauru. The district has a water border to the west by the Indian Ocean. The district is bordered to the east by Magharibi District. The district seat is in Stonetown. The city is the largest on the island of Zanzibar. It is located on the west coast of Unguja, the main island of the Zanzibar Archipelago, north of the much larger city of Dar es Salaam across the Zanzibar Channel. The city also serves as the capital of the Zanzibar Urban/West Region. In 2022 its population was 219,007.
Zanzibar City comprises two main parts, Stone Town and Ng'ambo (literally: "The Other Side"); the two areas were historically divided by a creek since filled in, with the street on the Stone Town side of the creek originally called Creek Road but later renamed to Benjamin Mkapa Road. Stone Town is the historical core of the city, the former capital of the Zanzibar Sultanate; because of its unique architecture and culture, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000. Ng'ambo is a much larger, modern area that developed around Stone Town after the Zanzibar Revolution, with office buildings and large apartment blocks such as those of the Michenzani neighbourhood. Zanzibar City is served by a number of international and domestic airlines via Abeid Amani Karume International Airport.
History.
In 1592, the first English ship arrived in port. In 1824, Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman established the capital of his kingdom in the city. The city was a high place of slavery, one of the main ports of East Africa for the slave trade. The famous slave trader Tippu Tip lived there. In 1846, the island had 360,000 enslaved for 450,000 inhabitants. In 1866, the British explorer David Livingstone (1813–1873) stayed in Zanzibar to prepare his last expedition to Tanzania. In 1892, Zanzibar was declared a free port.
Climate.
Zanzibar City has a tropical climate, very similar to whole Unguja island, and slightly hotter than what is found in Pemba. This climate is classified as a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification "Am"). The average temperature in Zanzibar City is . The average annual rainfall is . The monthly average temperatures are usually between . There are two rain seasons, with most rainfall coming between March and May and smaller rain season coming between November and December. Drier months are January - February, and a longer drier season between June and October.
Places of worship.
The places of worship in the city are predominantly Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Diocese of Zanzibar (Catholic Church), Anglican Church of Tanzania (Anglican Communion), Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (Lutheran World Federation), Baptist Convention of Tanzania (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God.
Constituencies.
For parliamentary elections, Tanzania is divided into constituencies. As of the 2010 elections the area for Zanzibar City District had ten of the nineteen constituencies in the region:

Asclepias curassavica

Asclepias curassavica, commonly known as tropical milkweed, is a flowering plant species of the milkweed genus, "Asclepias". It is native to the American tropics and has a pantropical distribution as an introduced species. Other common names include bloodflower or blood flower, cotton bush, hierba de la cucaracha, Mexican butterfly weed, redhead, scarlet milkweed, and wild ipecacuanha.
It is grown as an ornamental garden plant and as a food source for some butterflies, however it may be harmful to the migration patterns of monarch butterflies when used in gardens outside of its native tropical range. Though public concern for the rapidly declining monarch population increased the demand and commercial availability of milkweed among nurseries in the US, the results have been mixed. While tropical milkweed may effectively sustain monarch larvae, the perennial growth of the plant takes ill effect on the monarchs' migratory patterns and may have other physiological effects. Use of the tropical milkweed in gardens has disrupted monarch migrations notably in California, Texas, Florida, and South Carolina. Unlike the milkweed species native to these locations, the tropical milkweed does not go dormant in the winter causing non-migratory groups of butterflies to form. Planting "Asclepias curassavica" in nonnative regions therefore remains controversial and criticized. Alternatively, native milkweed species (such as showy milkweed, narrowleaf milkweed, and desert milkweed for California) are suggested for butterfly gardens.
It also attracts other members of the Danainae subfamily, such as the queen.
Description.
Typical plants are evergreen perennial subshrubs that grow up to tall and have pale gray stems. The leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems and are lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate shaped ending in acuminate or acute tips. Like other members of the genus, the sap is milky. The flowers are in cymes with 10-20 flowers each. They have purple or red corollas and corona lobes that are yellow or orange. Flowering occurs nearly year-round. The long, fusiform shaped fruits are called follicles. The follicles contain tan to brown seeds that are ovate in shape and long. The flat seeds have silky hairs that allow the seeds to float on air currents when the pod-like follicles dehisce (split open).
Cultivation.
There are a number of different cultivars with improved flower colors and shorter habit; some have bright red, yellow or orange colored flowers. "Asclepias curassavica" is sometimes used in butterfly gardens (see above for concerns for monarchs) or as a cut flower. However, when the stems or leaves are broken, a poisonous milky sap exudes which can cause eye injury.
Distribution.
"Asclepias curassavica" is described by NatureServe as a "widespread species, ranging from southern North America through Central America and into South America."
It is an introduced species in the US states of California, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas, as well as the US unincorporated territories of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.
It has been introduced and naturalized in the Chinese provinces of Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Qinghai, Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan, and Zhejiang, as well as in Taiwan.
"Asclepias curassavica" was introduced to Australia prior to 1869 and is widespread in parts of Queensland. It is considered an exotic plant, and a weed, at the Meteor Downs South Project near Rolleston, Queensland, Australia.
Chemistry.
"Asclepias curassavica" contains several cardiac glycosides, including asclepin, calotropin, uzarin and their free genins, calactin, coroglucigenin and uzarigenin. It also contains oleanolic acid, β-sitosterol, and glycosides of asclepin. The most abundant cardiac glycoside present in "Asclepias curassavica" leaves is voruscharin, which comprises around 40% of the total cardiac glycoside content in leaves. The sequenced genome of "Asclepias curassavica" provides insight into the biosynthesis of cardiac glycosides.

Sa'ar 3-class missile boat

The Sa'ar 3 class ("Cherbourg") is a series of missile boats built in Cherbourg, France at the Amiot Shipyard based on an Israeli Navy modification of the German Navy's . They are also known as the stars of Cherbourg.
Design and development.
The Israeli naval command had reached the conclusion by the early 1960s that their old Second World War-era destroyers, frigates and corvettes were obsolete and new ships and vessels were needed. Yitzhak Shoshan, later to command the destroyer INS "Eilat" at the time of her sinking, surveyed the available torpedo boat designs and recommended the German . The Israeli Navy asked Lürssen, the shipyard which built the "Jaguar" class, to modify the wooden "Jaguar"-class design by switching to steel construction, adding to the length, and revising the internal compartmentalization. Due to Arab League pressure on the German government, this plan was not continued and a new builder was sought. The Israeli Navy discovered that the Cherbourg-based Constructions Mécaniques de Normandie owned by Félix Amiot had experience building patrol boats in cooperation with Lürssen and would build the boats, based upon the German designs and plans. The engines were imported from Germany. The project received the code name "Falling Leaves" (). After the last 5 built were placed under embargo by the government of France, they were retrieved in the Cherbourg Project.
Operational history.
The Sa'ar 3 boats' first battle engagements were made during the October 1973 Yom Kippur War. During this war, the first surface-to-surface missile naval engagements took place. The first was at the Battle of Latakia where the Israeli Navy defeated many Syrian boats and coastal targets using Otobreda 76 mm guns and missiles. This was followed shortly thereafter by Israeli defeat of Egyptian forces at the Battle of Baltim.
In the 1980s, one of the Sa'ar boats got stuck in the Coastal waters of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabian authorities allowed the Israeli navy to free the ship and to take it away.

Marzena Godecki

Marzena Godecki (born 28 September 1978) is a Polish-Australian actress. She is best known for her starring role as Neri in "Ocean Girl".
Early life.
Marzena Godecki was born on 28 September 1978 in Bytom, Poland. When she was three years old her family emigrated from Poland to Australia. She was 16 and a modern dance and ballet student in Melbourne when she was selected from more than 500 girls who auditioned for the role of Neri in "Ocean Girl".
When she first tried out for the part Godecki recalls being taken to a local ocean pier in Melbourne and thrown into the cold waters to see if she was comfortable. She was, and after landing the lead role, Godecki was able to sharpen up her swimming skills and learn how to scuba dive at the "Ocean Girl" location, Port Douglas in Far North Queensland, Australia.
During the filming, Godecki was able to swim with dolphins and a pod of Minke whales that came up to the film crew's boat. Because much of "Ocean Girl" was filmed in the open water, she was always under the close watch of a stunt and dive safety team who kept a watch out for sharks.
Godecki took most of 1996 off from "Ocean Girl" to complete her final year at secondary school concentrating on her favourite subjects—maths and science. She originally hoped after the last season of "Ocean Girl" to secure a place at University in Australia in veterinary science owing to her love of animals.
Godecki married in 2008 and is now called Marzena D'Odorico. She has a son called Nico — born in July 2008 — and ran the children's fashion store Tiny Threads in Melbourne, together with her business partner Melanie Tsoukas, from 2008 to 2012.
She also has a daughter called Sasha, born in late 2011.
Career.
Before Godecki was selected for the role of Neri in "Ocean Girl" for her graceful style of underwater swimming, she was a student in Melbourne where she studied modern dance and ballet. She also went to Methodist Ladies College. 
Godecki was also a regular extra on the 1992 series of Round the Twist, appearing and sitting next to Linda in school scenes, but never is heard speaking. She was credited as "Beautiful Girl". Although in the episode "Nails" she is called "Madeleine" by Mr Snapper.

Early life and education.
Shetty was born as Sweety Shetty on 7 November 1981 in Mangalore, Karnataka. She is an ethnic Tuluva hailing from a Tulu-speaking Bunt family from Bellipady village in Puttur taluk of Dakshina Kannada district. Her parents are Prafulla and A. N. Vittal Shetty and she has two elder brothers, Gunaranjan Shetty and Sai Ramesh Shetty. Shetty received her Bachelor of Computer Applications from Mount Carmel College in Bangalore. She was also a yoga instructor, trained under Bharat Thakur.
While filming her debut film "Super", the director Puri Jagannadh and producer Nagarjuna were keen for Shetty to have a screen name as they felt her real name Sweety may not be appealing to the audience. While mulling over different names, they came across Anushka Manchanda who was singing one of the songs in the film. They liked her first name and decided to adopt Anushka as the screen name for Shetty's film career.
Career.
Early work (2005–2008).
Shetty made her acting debut in 2005 with Puri Jagannadh's "Super", where she featured alongside Nagarjuna and Ayesha Takia. "Sify" stated, "The sexy girls Ayesha and Anushka show off their bodies." For her performance, she earned her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress – Telugu. The same year, she acted in another film "Mahanandi", opposite Srihari and Sumanth. "IndiaGlitz" said, "Anushka looks comely ---and that is what she seems to be in for." but added, "The script has been stitched and the seams look frayed." "Sify" stated that it "starts promisingly with a racy first half but goes awry and the tempo slackens post interval." and added, "Anushka looks ravishing thanks to Vasu's camera which is a major plus for the film."
In 2006, she had four releases, the first being S. S. Rajamouli's "Vikramarkudu", where she was paired with Ravi Teja. Kishore of "Nowrunning.com" said "The high points of the movie are the flawless acting of Ravi Teja and the lusciousness of Anushka. Anushka has all the assets to that a woman ought to have." and "Sify" said that Anushka "is definitely a highlight." It was a commercial success. She next starred in the film "Astram", a remake of the 1999 Hindi film "Sarfarosh", following which she debuted in the Tamil film industry, acting in the Sundar C-directed action flick "Rendu", sharing screen space with R. Madhavan. Later that year, she made a special appearance alongside Mega star Chiranjeevi in A. R. Murugadoss' directorial debut in Telugu, "Stalin".
Her first release in 2007 was "Lakshya" which was a success in box office, after which she starred in Raghava Lawrence's "Don" opposite Nagarjuna again. The former, in particular, succeeded at the box office. In 2008 she had appeared in six films. "Okka Magaadu" was the first release, in which she played one of three female leads. Nandamuri Balakrishna was the actor opposite her in "Okka Magaadu". Her next releases "Swagatam" alongside Jagapathi Babu and Bhumika Chawla and "Baladoor" opposite Ravi Teja garnered poor reviews and box office returns. She next appeared in the film "Souryam" with Gopichand which became a box office hit. Her last release that year was "Chintakayala Ravi" opposite Venkatesh.
Experimental roles and success (2009–2010).
In 2009, Shetty first starred in the blockbuster hit, the fantasy film "Arundhati". In this heroine-centric film, she essayed two roles for the first time. "Idlebrain"s Jeevi wrote that she was "simply amazing in two roles" and that she did "exceptionally well with subtle yet impact creating performance," while "Rediff.com" claimed that she was "brilliant and breathtaking in parts," labelling "Arundhati" as "totally Anushka's film." "Sify" noted that she was "at her best with great performance" She went on to win the Nandi Special Jury Award and her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu. Her next film was "Billa", a remake of the 2007 Tamil film of the same name. The film received mixed reviews, with "Rediff" stating "Anushka has a super-toned body and indulges in quite a bit of skin show" but had "nothing much to do," while "Sify" stated "Anushka was there to show her oomph and glamour which she has done full justice." Her final release in 2009 was her second Tamil feature film, the action masala film "Vettaikkaran" with actor Vijay and it received generally unfavourable reviews. "Rediff" said, "Anushka, fresh from her success with "Arundhathi", has been relegated to pretty bimbette again and appears conveniently during the romantic numbers of which "Oru Chinna Thamarai" takes the cake." and "Sify" said, "Anushka has nothing much to do and hence goes unnoticed."
She had a string of releases in 2010. She portrayed a prostitute in Krish's anthology film "Vedam" which stars Allu Arjun. For her performance, she won her second consecutive Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu. Her next Telugu film, "Panchakshari", was another heroine-centric film where she again performed double roles. This was followed by the action comedy "Khaleja", where she starred opposite Mahesh Babu for the first time in her career, "Nagavalli", the Telugu remake of the Kannada film "Aptharakshaka" in which she portrayed the famous role of Chandramukhi and "Ragada". She also made special appearances in the films "Kedi" and "Thakita Thakita". However all these 2010 releases failed to make an impact at the box office. Her sole Tamil release of 2010, the police drama "Singam" co-starring Suriya was a major commercial success. "Sify" claimed, "Anushka is there only for adding glamour and songs, but does a decent job". while Pavithra Srinivasan of "Rediff" stated, "Anushka, thankfully, has more to do than just prance around in skimpy clothes (which she does very well). She romances dutifully, but her part picks up when both she and Suriya are in Chennai, tangling with villains." Despite its moderate commercial success, "Nagavalli" earned Anushka her third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu.
Commercial struggles (2011–2013).
She reprised the role she played in "Vedam" in its Tamil remake, "Vaanam" (2011). Malathi Rangarajan of "The Hindu" said, "Boldness and daring mark Anushka's role—the actor's eyes effectively convey joy, helplessness, agony and anger." A critic from "Sify" wrote that "Anushka is outstanding as the commercial sex worker as she is able to bring out a life-like performance." She next starred in A. L. Vijay's "Deiva Thirumagal". The drama centers on the characters of Krishna (Vikram), an intellectually disabled father and his daughter Nila. The film became a critical and commercial success, fetching her laurels for her portrayal as Anuradha, an advocate. "Oneindia" stated, "Anushka Shetty's character in the film had good scope for performance without being glamorous." For her performance, she won the Vijay Award for Favourite Heroine, in addition to her sole nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Tamil.
In 2012, Anushka collaborated again with A. L. Vijay and Vikram in the action drama "Thaandavam". Malathi Rangarajan stated that "the romance between Vikram and Anushka is a beautiful feature of "Thaandavam"." She later appeared alongside Nagarjuna in the fantasy film "Damarukam", which was her first Telugu release after two years. Karthik Pasupulate from "The Times of India" said that Anushka "has little to do as far as performance goes and does a good job of upping the glam quotient." Radhika Rajamani of "Rediff" claimed, "Anushka looks sweet. Nag and Anushka have good onscreen chemistry." "Oneindia" claimed, "Anushka Shetty has less scope for acting, but she impresses you in song sequences." She received her fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for her performance in the film.
Shetty's first release in 2013 was "Alex Pandian", an action-masala film, directed by Suraj, co-starring Karthi. The film was a critical and commercial failure. Her second release was Koratala Siva's "Mirchi" opposite Prabhas. "Idlebrain.com" claimed, "Anushka is adorable in a naughty village belle, the dubbing also seems great and the character Vennela is the best role among her recent roles in films" "Rediff" wrote, "Anushka is bubbly and peps up the film considerably." "Sify" wrote, "Anushka looks beautiful and livens up the moments and praised her chemistry with Prabhas." She earned her fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for her performance in "Mirchi". She was next seen in "Singam II", the sequel to "Singam" (2010), reprising her role from the first part. "Sify" said, "Anushka looks jaded, has nothing to do but sizzle with Suriya in two songs" while "The Times of India" stated, "Anushka is forced to take a back seat even as she reprises her role of Kavya."
Anushka's next release was Selvaraghavan's fantasy adventure film "Irandam Ulagam" opposite Arya, that saw her playing a dual role again, the third time in her career. Anushka played Ramya, a doctor and Varna, a high spirited, warrior-like character, in a parallel world. "Rediff" wrote, "Anushka not only shares equal screen space with Arya, but also plays quite a significant role. In fact, the story revolves around her and she has performed admirably." "Behindwoods" wrote, "As the shy doctor Ramya and as the fierce warrior Varna, Anushka is simply at her best showcasing a wide range of emotions and stunts. It is her performance that stands as a pivot for the rest of the story to take shape."
Established actress (2014–2017).
Her next release was the Tamil film "Lingaa" opposite Rajinikanth, released in December 2014. She starred opposite Rajnikanth in "Lingaa" which opened to mixed reviews.
In 2015, she starred opposite Ajith Kumar in "Yennai Arindhaal" which opened to positive reviews. Her second release in 2015, is the first part of "" directed by S. S. Rajamouli. She played a warrior princess Devasena, opposite Prabhas. It was a commercial success and became one of the highest grossing Indian film. Shetty was referred to in the media as the "Lady Superstar", post the film release. "The Hindu" noted "Anushka is gutsy to take on such a role and emotes through her powerful eyes." Her third release that year was Gunashekar's bilingual "Rudhramadevi", in which she portrays the title role of the queen of Kakatiya dynasty, Rudrama Devi opposite Allu Arjun and Rana Daggubati. "AP Herald" wrote, "Anushka is very believable and appreciable as a royal torrid and an honorable woman. Hers is a dual character, that of next to kin 'Rudhradeva' and of powerful 'Rudhramadevi' are superb. She plays her dual role in her characters in style and lends credibility to both the characters." She won her third Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for her performance in the film. Her final release of the year was "Size Zero" where she played a plus-sized women. In 2016, she appeared in two cameo appearances in "Soggade Chinni Nayana" and "Oopiri". 
Shetty's first film release in 2017 was "Si3", in which she was paired with Suriya for the third time in her career. In "Om Namo Venkatesaya" Shetty portrayed Krishnamma, a Goda Devi or Andal-inspired character. Her next release was "", where she reprised Devasena. The character of Devasena was highly praised by critics and Shetty's portrayal was equally lauded. A "Firstpost" article noted that the female characters in the second part were the actual heroes of the saga. Comparing Devasena to Arjuna, the article described her as "a competitive warrior who can wield the bow and arrow with finesse". It further noted how her character emphasized the need of freedom of choice writing that "in Devasena's case by taking archery lessons, choosing her life partner and being given the right to reject a matrimonial alliance, she can be her own person and develop into a strong personality, who doesn't break down even when chained for 25 years in the palace courtyard." She earned her seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for her performance in "Baahubali 2: The Conclusion". It was a commercial success and grossed more than the prequel, becoming second highest grossing Indian film. The Baahubali film series firmly established Shetty as a leading South Indian actress.
Career expansion (2018–present).
In the 2018 film "Bhaagamathie", Shetty played the character Chanchala, an IAS officer, who is sent to prison after killing her fiancé. Anushka's portrayal of Bhaagamathie and Chanchala was notable. "The News Minute" wrote, "There is no woman actor in the south who has the kind of commanding presence that Anushka does. When she's on screen, there's no one else you want to watch. I suppose if I ever met her in person, I'd hear imaginary elephants trumpeting around me because she gets under the skin of these regal roles so convincingly." Praising Shetty's performance it further read, "Anushka alternates between playing the gentle Chanchala and the vengeful Bhaagamathie with ease. This is an actor who can pull off stereotypical depictions of femininity without it grating on your nerves – so when she swoons at the sight of blood in one scene, it doesn't put you off because she takes herself seriously and isn't around just as a decorative festoon." The film earnedher eighth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for her performance. 
In 2019, Shetty appeared in "Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy" as Rani Lakshmi Bai. In 2020, she played a painter in the bilingual "Nishabdham" opposite R. Madhavan. Following a three year hiatus, Shetty played a woman opting for artificial insemination in "Miss Shetty Mr Polishetty" opposite Naveen Polishetty. The film was a box office success. Janaki K of "India Today" noted, "Anushka as Anvitha is quite natural in her role and it makes you fall in love all over again." Shetty will next appear in the Telugu film "Ghaati", and will make her Malayalam film debut with "Kathanar – The Wild Sorcerer", as Kalliyankattu Neeli.

Shetty is a recipient of three Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for her performance in "Arundhati", "Vedam" and "Rudhramadevi".

Acedia

Acedia (; also accidie or accedie , from Latin , and this from Greek , "negligence", "lack of" "care") has been variously defined as a state of listlessness or torpor, of not caring or not being concerned with one's position or condition in the world. In ancient Greece, "akēdía" literally meant an inert state without pain or care. Early Christian monks used the term to define a spiritual state of listlessness and from there the term developed a markedly Christian moral tone. In modern times, it has been taken up by literary figures and connected to depression.
In ancient Greece.
In Ancient Greece, acedia originally meant indifference or carelessness along the lines of its etymological meaning of lack of care. Thus, Homer in the "Iliad" uses it to both mean soldiers heedless of a comrade (, "and none of the other [soldiers] was heedless of him.") and the body of Hector lying unburied and dishonored in the camp of the Acheans (μή πω μ᾽ ἐς θρόνον ἵζε διοτρεφὲς ὄφρά κεν Ἕκτωρ κεῖται ἐνὶ κλισίῃσιν ἀκηδής. "Seat me not anywise upon a chair, O thou fostered of Zeus, so long as Hector lieth uncared-for amid the huts.") Hesiod uses it in the sense of "indifferent" (, "unconquered and untroubled"). Peter Toohey, in his article "Acedia in Late Classical Antiquity", argues that acedia, even in ancient times, was synonymous with depression.
Depictions in the early Christian era.
Moral theologians, intellectual historians, and cultural critics have variously construed acedia as the ancient depiction of a variety of psychological states, behaviors, or existential conditions - primarily laziness, apathy, ennui, or boredom.
The demon of acedia holds an important place in early monastic demonology and protopsychology. In the late fourth century, Evagrius of Pontus, for example, characterizes it as "the most troublesome of all" of the eight genera of evil thoughts. As with those who followed him, Evagrius sees acedia as a temptation, and the great danger lies in giving in to it. Evagrius' contemporary, the Desert Father John Cassian, depicted the apathetic restlessness of "acedia", "the noonday demon", in the cenobitic monk:
He looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun, as if it was too slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him like some foul darkness.
In the medieval Latin tradition of the seven deadly sins, acedia has generally been folded into the sin of sloth. The Benedictine Rule directed that a monk displaying the outward signs of acedia should;–
be reproved a first and a second time. If he does not amend he must be subjected to the punishment of the rule so that the others may have fear.
The Middle Ages.
According to the "Oxford Concise Dictionary of the Christian Church" "by the early 5th cent., the word had become a technical term in Christian asceticism, signifying a state of restlessness and inability either to work or to pray." Not only monks and theologians spoke of the vice, but it appears in the writings of laymen, as well. It appears in Dante's "Divine Comedy" not only as a sin to be punished in the damned, but also as the sin that leads Dante to the edge of Hell to begin with. Chaucer's parson includes acedia in his list of vices. It follows anger and envy in the list and the parson connects the three vices together: For Envye blindeth the herte of a man, and Ire troubleth a man; and Accidie maketh him hevy, thoghtful, and wrawe. / Envye and Ire maken bitternesse in herte; which bitternesse is moder of Accidie, and binimeth him the love of alle goodnesse.
In his sustained analysis of the vice in Q. 35 of the "Second Part (Secunda Secundae)" of his "Summa Theologica", 13th-century theologian Thomas Aquinas identifies acedia with "the sorrow of the world" (compare "Weltschmerz") that "worketh death" and contrasts it with that sorrow "according to God" described by St. Paul in 2 Cor. 7:10. For Aquinas, acedia is "sorrow about spiritual good in as much as it is a Divine good." It becomes a mortal sin when reason consents to man's "flight" ("fuga") from the Divine good, "on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit." Acedia is essentially a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one does not care. The ultimate expression of this is a despair that ends in suicide.
Aquinas's teaching on acedia in Q. 35 contrasts with his prior teaching on charity's gifted "spiritual joy", to which acedia is directly opposed, and which he explores in Q. 28 of the "Secunda Secundae". As Aquinas says, "One opposite is known through the other, as darkness through light. Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good."
Modern revival.
The term acedia had all but died out in common usage by the beginning of the 20th century. "In the 1933 Oxford English Dictionary, "accidie" was confidently declared obsolete, with references dating from 1520 and 1730. But by the mid-20th century, as people were contending with the two world wars, "accidie" was back in use." No longer the exclusive property of theologians, the word appears in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Ian Fleming.
Signs.
Acedia is indicated by a range of signs (or symptoms), which are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. Somatic (physical) symptoms range from mere sleepiness to general "sickness, debility, weakening of the knees, and all the members" (in a description attributed to the fifth-century Theodora of Alexandria by 21st-century author Laura Swan). A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of acedia, which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted. Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of acedia is tedium, boredom, or general laziness. Author Kathleen Norris in her book "Acedia and Me" asserts that dictionary definitions such as "torpor" and "sloth" fail to do justice to this temptation; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages, etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare, etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being "a slave from within". She relates this to forgetfulness about "the one thing needful": remembrance of God.

Education Reference Group

Connecticut school districts are grouped into Education Reference Groups (ERGs), also known as "District Reference Groups" (DRGs) based on the characteristics of their student's families. Districts in an ERG have similar median family incomes, percentages of families below the poverty level, percentages of single-parent families, percentage of families with a non-English home language, percentages of families in which one or both parents have a bachelor's degree, and percentages of families in white collar or managerial occupations. The number of students enrolled in the district is also considered.
ERGs range from A (most affluent) to I.
The Connecticut State Department of Education created the educational reference groups (ERGs) in 1989 as a research and performance measurement tool. ERGs are a classification system under which school districts are grouped together to allow legitimate education outcome comparisons among districts.

From 1945 to 1963, the ferry route from West Germany to Denmark had run between Großenbrode and Gedser. A train ferry terminal was built in Puttgarden in 1961-63 and at the same time Fehmarn was connected to the mainland by bridge. Since the completion of the Great Belt Fixed Link in Denmark, the route via Puttgarden became less used by trains and Puttgarden station closed in 2022. The harbour is still used by Scandlines ferries, with a fleet of four ferries giving one connection every 30 minutes, 24 hours a day.
Tunnel to Denmark.
A tunnel connection is under construction across the Fehmarn Belt. Originally planned as a bridge, the solution eventually chosen was an immersed tunnel comprising both a road and a rail link. The Danish government is financing construction. The fixed link will have road fees comparable to the ferry fees. It is planned to be completed in 2029.

Ask, Vestland

Ask is a small village in the eastern part of Askøy municipality in Vestland county, Norway. The village lies along the Byfjorden on the eastern shore of the island of Askøy. The village of Ask is well known for the farming of strawberries which are sold in the marketplace in the nearby city of Bergen during the summer season.
The village has a population (2019) of 1,562 and a population density of .
Due to its pleasant climate and its location on an island near Bergen, Ask was the location of a "kongsgård" (i.e., royal farm – the Norwegian equivalent of a palace estate). "Ask gård" (literally Ask farm), with the farm number 1, was the basis for the name of Askøy. This was also the site of the extremely old church and churchyard which was in use from around the year 1200 until 1741. Today the old church site is marked by a stone cross. A newer Ask Church was built in the centre of Ask in 1741. Ask village is the saga location for a famous dispute over inheritance between Egill Skallagrímsson and Berg-Önundr. When Berg-Önundr refused to allow Egill to claim his wife Ásgerðr's share of her father's inheritance, Egill challenged Önundr to a holmgang.
The local dialect of the village also reflects the continuing close tie to Bergen, with the dialect being more similar to that of Bergen than that of the rest of Askøy; the connection was reinforced into modern times as the wealthy merchants and other residents of Bergen summered there.
Ask has had famous residents up to recent times. Fridtjof Nansen lived in a house near "Kongshaugen" in a short period. Amalie Skram lived at "Lien" at Ask, near "Ask Dambruk", from 1876 to 1878, in the same house where the headmaster, "Nils Peder Åland", lived for 40 years.
Older history.
The legendary Scandinavian hero and skald whose adventures are retold in Gesta Danorum and in the legendary sagas, Starkad, as well as Egil Skallagrimson of historic saga fame and the last Catholic Archbishop in Norway, Olav Engelbrektsson, Archbishop of Nidaros, have connections to Ask.
The sagas mention Ask as early as the 6th century. King Hertjov of Hordaland traveled to Agder and took with him two boys named Stakard and Vikar. As was common in the period, he asked Grane, who held the land (farm) of Ask, to raise these boys. As they grew, they became great hunters and warriors. As warriors, the boys revenged attacks on Ask by Vikings from Hordaland, who had robbed villages in Agder. Ask became their new home until Vikar was killed by an accident. After this, Stakard had to leave the country. He was known in Denmark and Sweden.
Egils saga tells that in the 9th century, "Torgeir Tyrnefot" owned Ask. His son was "Berg Onund". Berg Onund was killed in an attack led by Egil Skallagrimson, one of the most powerful men on Iceland. As revenge for a miscarriage in inheritance in around 960, Egil travel with his men through Herdlafjorden and to Ask, where they arrive at the farm, killing 15 or 16 men and pillaging.
The first church in Askøy was most probably built at the pagan "sacrifice mountain" located at Ask.
Archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson was the last Catholic bishop in Norway. His final residence was in Bergen and as the Reformation spread throughout Norway in 1534, he took refuge at Ask.
Mauritz Bostede bought Ask in 1628. Other well-known men from Bergen have also owned Ask for extended periods. Thomas Ericssen built a large house in the area and Thomas Ericssen Minde from 1795 is the only building at Askøy from that period that is preserved today.
Later history.
Since Ask is located only northwest of Bergen (across the Byfjorden), around the years 1880-1890 there was a resurgence in the popularity of Ask as a vacation destination from Bergen. As a result, there were increases in commercial cargo and passenger transport by steamboat. The "Fridtjof" was one of the boats that went into between Ask and Bergen.
When the road to Kleppestø was constructed around 1950, the traffic at the Ask harbour decreased.
The writer, Amalie Skram's first husband, Captain Bernt Ulrik August Müller, bought a watermill in the area and they lived there for some years.
Emanuel Jæger started commercial strawberry production. He sent his strawberries to Fleischer's Hotel at Voss. The strawberries were of the German type "Sieger" (victory) and these was very popular throughout the area in the last century.
Geography.
Ask is located on the eastern part of the island of Askøy. The Herdlefjorden is located to the east of the village and the Nordhordland Bridge is visible from the village. The lake Askevatnet and extensive forests are located in the area west of Ask.
Cultural arrangements.
On May Day each year, the Ask-relay is held. In 2006 the relay celebrated its 54th running.

Soul Asylum discography

The discography of American alternative rock band Soul Asylum consists of 12 studio albums, two live albums, five compilation albums, two extended plays (EPs), 22 singles, and 17 music videos. Formed in 1981 in Minneapolis, Minnesota using the name Loud Fast Rules, the band's original lineup consisted of vocalist Dave Pirner, guitarist Dan Murphy, bassist Karl Mueller, and drummer Pat Morley. The band changed their name to Soul Asylum prior to the release of "Say What You Will... Everything Can Happen" in 1984. Later that year, Morley was replaced on drums by Grant Young.
The band released two studio albums for Twin/Tone Records in 1986, "Made to Be Broken" and "While You Were Out", as well as the cassette-only "Time's Incinerator", a collection of B-sides, outtakes, and demos. Having a loyal and growing fan base, along with positive reviews from alternative rock critics, Soul Asylum signed with A&amp;M Records in 1988. They recorded the "Clam Dip &amp; Other Delights" EP for European release, followed by the full-length "Hang Time" in 1988. Produced by Lenny Kaye and Ed Stasium, "Hang Time" was well-received on college radio but the follow-up album, "And the Horse They Rode in On" (1990), was a critical and commercial disappointment, resulting in the band being dropped by A&amp;M.
Soul Asylum signed with Columbia Records and released "Grave Dancers Union" in 1992. The album's first single, "Somebody to Shove", went to number one on the Modern Rock chart, and "Black Gold" also received significant airplay on radio and MTV. "Runaway Train" crossed over to the pop charts, peaking at number five on the "Billboard" Hot 100 in 1993 and winning the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song's music video, directed by Tony Kaye, features photos of missing children and was adapted for several international markets. "Runaway Train" peaked at number one in Canada and reached the top 10 in the Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The song's success helped "Grave Dancers Union" achieve double-platinum certification by Music Canada and by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States.
The band's seventh album, "Let Your Dim Light Shine" (1995), peaked at number six in the US and in Canada. It was certified double-platinum in Canada and platinum in the US. Lead single "Misery" charted at number three in Canada and was a top 30 hit in the US, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. In September 1995, Soul Asylum performed at a concert commemorating the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opening in Cleveland, Ohio. A two-disc compilation of the event released the following year features the band's performances of "Back Door Man" with Iggy Pop and "Sweet Jane" with Lou Reed. Soul Asylum's next studio album, "Candy from a Stranger" (1998), charted in the US and Canada but it sold fewer copies and received less favorable reviews than its predecessors. After taking a break, the band began recording a new album in 2004. However, sessions were put on hold when bassist Karl Mueller was diagnosed with throat cancer; he died the following year. Guest musicians—including bassist Tommy Stinson, who later joined the group as a permanent member—were brought in to complete the album "The Silver Lining" (2006). The band's next album, "Delayed Reaction" (2012), received positive reviews and it entered the US album charts, but founding member Dan Murphy left the group at the end of the year. Soul Asylum released their eleventh album, "Change of Fortune", in 2016 and their twelfth album, "Hurry Up and Wait", in 2020.

Kumi Kumi

Kumi Kumi (from Swahili 'kumi' for 'ten') is an illegal liquor brewed in Kenya from sorghum, maize or millet. The cheap, widely brewed drink grows in popularity among the lower classes and disadvantaged of the region, as the economy and the value of the shilling has declined. Kumi Kumi is known for its exceptional alcohol content.
Kumi Kumi is so named for its cheap price, KSh.10/= for a mug, which in 2006 comes to roughly US$0.15. Legal beers usually cost around KSh.65/=.
Health concerns.
The brew is often doctored in unsafe and poisonous ways, and its regular abuse frequently has resulted in alcohol poisoning related hospitalizations, blindness, and death.

2004 FA Cup final

The 2004 FA Cup final was the 123rd FA Cup Final and the fourth to be played at the Millennium Stadium, the Welsh national stadium in Cardiff, due to the ongoing reconstruction of the usual venue, London's Wembley Stadium. The match took place on 22 May 2004 and it was contested by Manchester United, who had finished third in the Premier League that season, and Millwall, who had finished 10th in the First Division.
Manchester United secured a record 11th FA Cup victory with a headed goal from Cristiano Ronaldo and a brace from Ruud van Nistelrooy, which included a penalty kick. In contrast, it was Millwall's first appearance in a final of either the FA Cup or the Football League Cup. At the trophy presentation after the match, the Manchester United players wore shirts bearing the name and number of midfielder Jimmy Davis, who died in a road accident in August 2003.
The match was refereed by Jeff Winter. Tony Green and Roger East were the assistant referees and Matt Messias was the fourth official.
Background.
Manchester United were appearing in their 16th FA Cup final and had won it on 10 of their previous 15 appearances. Two of these victories had yielded a League and FA Cup double (in 1994 and 1996) and in 1999 they had won the FA Cup as part of an unprecedented treble of Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup wins.
For Millwall, 2004 was their first appearance in an FA Cup final, although they had reached the semi-finals on three prior occasions: 1900, 1903 and 1937. Their appearance in the 1937 semi-final was notable as Millwall were the first team in the old Third Division to reach that stage. They also became only the second team from outside the top flight of English football to reach the final since 1982, and the first team from outside the Premier League since its foundation in 1992. Millwall reached the 2004 decider without having met any club from the Premier League along the way.

Pre-match.
Venue.
Due to the ongoing reconstruction of Wembley Stadium, the match was played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff for the fourth year in a row. The stadium was built in 1998 ahead of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales, with a capacity of 72,500. While it was being built, the Wales national rugby union team played its home matches at the old Wembley Stadium, so after Wembley was torn down in 2000, the Millennium Stadium was selected to host the finals of the FA Cup, the League Cup and the Football League play-offs until at least 2003. Delays to the construction of the new Wembley meant that deal was later extended until 2006.
Referee.
The referee for the final was Jeff Winter from Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, who was officiating in his last match as a professional referee, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 45. Winter's assistant referees were Roger East and Tony Green, while Matt Messias was the fourth official.
Broadcasting.
The match was broadcast live on television in the United Kingdom on both BBC One and Sky Sports 1. The BBC broadcast was presented by Gary Lineker, with Alan Hansen, Peter Schmeichel and Michael Owen in the studio, and commentary from John Motson in his 25th FA Cup Final as lead commentator. The BBC also provided live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live, presented by Mark Pougatch, with commentary from Alan Green and Mike Ingham, and analysis from Jimmy Armfield and Steve Claridge.
Match.
Team selection.
Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll appeared to have earned his place in the team for the FA Cup final after a run of good performances between the end of March and mid-April 2004, conceding just two goals in five games, including the semi-final win over Arsenal on 3 April. However, a 1–0 defeat away to Portsmouth on 17 April led to a recall for American goalkeeper Tim Howard for the last five games of the season. Although Howard conceded three goals in that time, he retained his place in the team for the cup final. Following the recurrence of a knee injury against Arsenal on 28 March, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy was only able to play in one match in April 2004 and was expected to miss the last two league games against Chelsea and Aston Villa to ensure his fitness for the final; however, he recovered in time to play and score in both games, guaranteeing his place up front against Millwall. One surprise selection saw Darren Fletcher named in central midfield alongside Roy Keane ahead of both Nicky Butt and Phil Neville.
Millwall went into the final with doubts over the fitness of player-manager Dennis Wise (knee), captain Kevin Muscat (knee) and midfielder Paul Ifill (groin); Wise and Ifill recovered in time to play in the final, but Muscat was ruled out for the rest of the season. Bob Peeters, Andy Roberts, Tony Warner and Charley Hearn also missed the game through injury, while striker Danny Dichio was suspended. Because they were unable to play in the game, and with manager Wise in the starting line-up, Muscat and Warner led the Millwall team out for the national anthem before kick-off.
Summary.
The first chances of the match fell to Manchester United's Paul Scholes, who took a couple of long-range efforts at goal – one went just wide while another was tipped away by Millwall goalkeeper Andy Marshall. Scholes was presented with another opportunity on the six-yard line, when a rabona cross from Cristiano Ronaldo found him unmarked; the midfielder seemed as surprised by the cross as everyone else and completely missed the ball with his hooked shot.
Millwall's only chance of the first half came when Paul Ifill broke down the right-hand side of the pitch and arrowed in towards the penalty area, only to have his shot blocked. They looked to have survived the first half without conceding until a minute before the interval, when Roy Keane played in Gary Neville as the right-back moved into the penalty area and Neville chipped a cross back across the box; Millwall player-manager Dennis Wise waited for the ball to arrive, but in doing so, he allowed Ronaldo to steal in and head the ball past Marshall, to give United a 1–0 lead going into the break.
Manchester United went 2–0 up 20 minutes into the second half, when Ryan Giggs went on a run down the right wing into the Millwall box only to be brought down by David Livermore. Referee Jeff Winter awarded a penalty for the foul and Ruud van Nistelrooy scored with a powerful shot into the top-corner to the goalkeeper's right. United now held a comfortable advantage and Millwall struggled to find a way back into the match. United's defence kept Neil Harris and Tim Cahill at bay, and the Red Devils eventually scored a third when Giggs went on a run down the left and crossed for Van Nistelrooy to tap in from three yards out. There were suggestions that Van Nistelrooy was offside at the moment of Giggs' pass, but television replays showed his feet were grounded in an onside position.
Millwall had a chance near the end when substitute Mark McCammon almost found a way through United's defence, while Scholes had a late effort for the Reds, before Curtis Weston (aged 17 years and 119 days) replaced Wise to become the youngest player to appear in an FA Cup final, beating the record set by James F. M. Prinsep of Clapham Rovers, when he appeared in the 1879 FA Cup Final at the age of 17 years and 245 days. The match finished 3–0 to Manchester United, their 11th success in the FA Cup.
Post-match.
Manchester United were presented with the FA Cup by England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson, who selected Ruud van Nistelrooy as the man of the match. For the trophy presentation, the Manchester United squad changed into shirts bearing the name and squad number of Jimmy Davis, who died in a road accident while on loan to Watford in August 2003. Eriksson's selection of Van Nistelrooy as man of the match was met with criticism from some members of the media, with both the BBC and "The Guardian" naming Cristiano Ronaldo as the game's best player. Ronaldo received praise from both his manager Alex Ferguson and teammate Gary Neville after the game, as well as BBC pundit Alan Hansen and "The Guardian"s Andy Gray.
Dennis Wise claimed Ronaldo's goal at the end of the first half proved the turning point in the match, but he felt there were plenty of positives for his team to take from the game. It was Tim Cahill's last game for Millwall, as he signed for Everton in July 2004, and Nicky Butt's last game for Manchester United, as he signed for Newcastle United later that same month.
Since Manchester United had already qualified for the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League by virtue of their league position, Millwall qualified for the first round of the 2004–05 UEFA Cup. Club owner Theo Paphitis said the club had made around £2.5 million for making it to the FA Cup final, but that the club could stand to lose money if they failed to reach the group stage of the UEFA Cup.
It was the last time that Manchester United won the FA Cup until 2016.

Gear (magazine)

Gear was an American men's magazine published by Bob Guccione, Jr. devoted chiefly to revealing pictorials of popular singers, B-movie actresses, and models, along with articles on gadgets, cars, fashion, sex, and sports.
History and profile.
"Gear" debuted in September 1998, with actress Peta Wilson on the cover. The magazine established itself with several publishing stunts such as publishing a nude photo of women's football celebrity Brandi Chastain.
When "Gear" featured a pictorial of a scantily clad Jessica Biel in the March 2000 issue, who posed while appearing on the family drama "7th Heaven" and was then 17 years old, actor Stephen Collins, who played her father on the show, described the pictures as "child pornography". Biel later cited it as one of her biggest regrets. "Esquire" magazine described the photo shoot as "quasi-infamous".
Guccione described his vision for the magazine as being a successor to the likes of "Esquire" and "GQ" and to produce a literate magazine that includes quality journalism alongside articles on celebrities and fashion. Advertisers viewed the magazine as being more like "Maxim", "Stuff", or "FHM", forcing it into the category of lads mags. Efforts were made to change the magazine's perceived image by moving from covers featuring scantily clad female celebrities to different cover images, including notable actors such as Elijah Wood and Christian Slater.
"Gear" closed in 2003 with the intention of relaunching at a later date, hoping to break out of the lads mag category as "Details" had done. The magazine was described as similar to "Spin" also founded by Bob Guccione, Jr., and was praised for attempts to achieve the same kind of serious journalism. Ann Gerhart of "The Washington Post" described the magazine derisively as "the frat boy's "Esquire"".

Virginia State Route 92

State Route 92 (SR 92) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs from U.S. Route 58 Business (US 58 Business) north and west to US 360 near Clover. SR 92 connects Boydton and Clover with Chase City via central Mecklenburg County, southern Charlotte County, and northeastern Halifax County in Southside Virginia. All of SR 92 is the former alignment of State Route 12, the predecessor to US 58.
Route description.
SR 92 begins at an intersection with US 58 Business (Madison Street) in Boydton, the county seat of Mecklenburg County. The state highway heads north as Washington Street to the north town limit of Boydton, where the highway intersects US 58. SR 92 heads north through a mix of farmland and forest to the town of Chase City. The state highway follows Main Street through a short jog west at Sycamore Street before meeting SR 47 and SR 49 in the center of town. SR 47 heads east on Second Street. Both SR 47 and SR 49 head north on Main Street. SR 92 and SR 49 run concurrently west from the center of town as Second Street. The two state highways diverge just east of the town limits. SR 92 heads west past Chase City Municipal Airport before entering Charlotte County. SR 92, which is named Jeb Stuart Highway within Charlotte County, intersects US 15 (Barnesville Highway) at Barnes Junction and US 360 (Kings Highway) near Public Fork before reaching the wide floodplain of the Roanoke River. SR 92's bridge over the river has been closed since 2008. The state highway continues in Halifax County as Clover Road to a Norfolk Southern Railway rail line, where the highway curves southwest and passes through the town of Clover as Main Street. Just south of town, SR 92 reaches its terminus at US 360 (James D. Hagood Highway).
History.
The full length of SR 92 was State Route 12 from 1918 to 1933. When SR 12 was eliminated in the 1933 renumbering, most of current SR 92, from US 15 at Barnes Junction east to Boydton, became State Route 46; old SR 12 west from Barnes Junction through Clover to Danville was part of US 360. In the 1940 renumbering, the State Route 46 designation was needed to match North Carolina Highway 46, and so the State Route 92 designation was applied to former SR 46 southeast of Chase City. The rest of SR 46, from Chase City west to Barnes Junction, became part of State Route 47, which continued east from Chase City to South Hill and north from Barnes Junction to Pamplin City.
In 1968, a new alignment of US 360 was under construction from near Clover to near Wylliesburg (north of Barnes Junction). SR 92 was extended west from Chase City to Barnes Junction, concurrent with SR 47, and then continuing west over old US 360 beyond Clover. The SR 47 overlap was removed in 1979 when a new alignment for SR 47 northwest from Chase City was adopted.

72nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment

The 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry (originally raised as the 3rd California) was a volunteer infantry regiment which served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It was part of the famous Philadelphia Brigade.
Members of this regiment wore a modified zouave-style uniform, consisting of a zouave jacket trimmed with red without a tombeaux on the jacket, sky-blue trousers with a red stripe down the leg, a sky-blue zouave vest trimmed in red, white gaiters, and a dark blue kepi. The jacket was decorated with 16 ball brass buttons down the front of the jacket, which were not part of the original French Zouave uniform.
History.
Colonel Edward D. Baker, powerful congressman and close friend of President Lincoln, organized the Third California Volunteer Infantry Regiment in Philadelphia, one of four regiments of the California Brigade. Baker wanted the brigade to represent and give credit to California in the Federal army. The regiment was recruited from among the firemen of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in early August 1861. DeWitt Clinton Baxter was its colonel, Theodore Hesser lieutenant colonel, and J. M. De Witt major.
After Baker's death October 21, 1861 at the Battle of Ball's Bluff, Pennsylvania reclaimed the regiments as its own. The California Brigade became the Philadelphia Brigade and each unit was given a new number. The Third California Regiment became the 72nd Pennsylvania Regiment. After some months of patrolling along the Potomac River, the 72nd was transported to the Peninsula. It saw its first action at the Battle of Seven Pines on May 1, 1862. During the Seven Days Battles, it supported the army's rear guard.
The 72nd saw light skirmishing at the Battle of Chantilly. At the Battle of Antietam, the regiment participated in the attack on the West Woods, being routed along with much of the rest of the division. Nearly half of the regiment was lost, including several officers killed.
At the Battle of Gettysburg, it defended the Angle on July 2 and 3. On the evening of the 2nd, it helped defeat Confederate Brigade General Ambrose R. Wright's attack, advancing just over the stone wall. The next day, it was placed in reserve for the brigade near the copse of trees. During Pickett's Charge, its position served as a rallying point for the left wing of the 71st and two companies of the 106th Pennsylvania, which had been driven back. Despite Brigadier General Alexander S. Webb's best efforts, these troops refused to counterattack for several minutes. This might have been due to the 71st's colorbearers being shot down. (Civil War regiments often followed the regimental flag since orders would have been difficult to hear on the battlefield.) The regiment though, after realizing the error and miscommunication charged and plugged in the gap. At Gettysburg, Col. Baxter replaced the wounded General Webb in command of the Brigade, and Lt. Col. Hesser replaced him in command of the 72nd Regiment.
The unit fought well during the Overland Campaign and in the beginning stages of the Siege of Petersburg. On June 24, 1864, the regiment was mustered out of service.
A total of 1,600 men fought in the 72nd, of whom 1,053 became casualties, a 65% casualty rate.

Stewartia pseudocamellia

Stewartia pseudocamellia, also known as Korean stewartia, Japanese stewartia, or deciduous camellia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Theaceae, native to Japan (southern Honshū, Kyūshū, Shikoku) and Korea.
Names.
It is called "natsutsubaki"(, "summer camellia") in Japanese, and "nogaknamu"(, "overripe cucumber tree") in Korean.
The Latin specific epithet "pseudocamellia" references the flower's resemblance to the related camellia.
Description.
It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree, growing to 10–15 m (rarely to 18 m) tall often with multiple stems and/or low branching trunks. The bark is smooth textured, exfoliating as the plants age, and has a camouflaged or mottled appearance with patterns of dull orange and green with grey mixed in. The trees are pyramidal to rounded in shape with deep green coloured foliage. Young stems have a zig-zag shape with flattened, divergent buds. The leaves are 4–12 cm long and 2.5–5 cm broad, arranged alternately on the stems with an elliptical shape and finely serrated edges. In the fall the foliage turns yellow, red or purple. The flowers are up to 8 cm wide, with five white petals with orange anthers; they are shaped like those of the related "Camellia", round and flat to somewhat cupped. They are produced in summer, generally in June until the end of August; each flower is short-lived, but many are produced that open over many weeks. The fruit is a brown capsule, triangular in shape with four or five angles, persistent on the trees but not showy.
Varieties.
There are two varieties:
Cultivation.
"Stewartia pseudocamellia" is an attractive ornamental tree that grows best in rich organic soils with good drainage and consistent moisture throughout the year. It is grown in full sun, but under hot and dry conditions it grows best in some light shade during the afternoon. It is used as a specimen planting in shrub borders or as a specimen in lawn plantings, having year round interest. It can be temperamental to establish and younger trees transplant best. When grown with single trunks they form taller more pyramidal shaped trees, when having multiple trunks plants tend to grow shorter and spread out wider. In the wild in Japan plants have been known to grow tall, and in cultivation have already reached up to tall.
"S. pseudocamellia" was introduced into western cultivation in 1874, and has survived winters as cold as .
In the UK this plant, and the Koreana Group, have received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Tekov

Tekov [Hungarian: "Bars"] is the traditional name of a region situated in southern and central Slovakia. Its territory encompasses the former Bars county, existing in the Kingdom of Hungary from the 11th century until 1918, though it is now administratively divided between the Nitra and Banská Bystrica regions (districts Žiar nad Hronom, Žarnovica, Zlaté Moravce, and partly Levice).
Tekov is situated along the Hron river, between the Hont region in the east, (including) Kremnica and Hronská Dúbrava in the north, the Žitava river in the west, Bešeňov and (excluding) Bíňa in the south. The rivers Hron and Žitava flow through the region.
The original seat of the count was the Tekov Castle (since 1321), then Levice Castle. The capital moved in the late 1580 to Topoľčianky and in the late 18th century to Zlaté Moravce.

Polow da Don

Jamal Fincher Jones (born October 15, 1977 or 1978), known professionally as Polow da Don, is an American record producer from Atlanta, Georgia. He began his career as a recording artist in the late 1990s, leaving college to pursue a career with the short-lived hip hop group Jim Crow. They signed with Epic Records in 1999 and released two albums—"Crow's Nest" (1999) and "Right Quick" (2001)—before being dropped from the label. 
Although disappointed, Jones formed a Southern hip hop group with Bubba Sparxxx, Sean P, Pastor Troy, G Rock, and Timbaland; however, they split up without any releases. Jones began producing instrumentals in 2001. His first beat tape made its way to Interscope Records founder, Jimmy Iovine, and its contents were ultimately used for the singles "Runaway Love" by Ludacris, "Buttons" by the Pussycat Dolls, and "This Is the Life" by Tru-Life.
Since then, Jones has produced numerous hit singles for various artists, including "Love in This Club" for Usher (2008), "Glamorous", "London Bridge" and "M.I.L.F. $" for Fergie (2006, 2016), "Anaconda" for Nicki Minaj (2014), "Forever" for Chris Brown (2008), "Baby by Me" for 50 Cent (2009), "Throw Some D's" for Rich Boy (2007), "Promise" for Ciara (2006), and "John" for Lil Wayne (2011), among others. The former three songs peaked atop the "Billboard" Hot 100, while others each found success on the chart. Also known as a charismatic hype man, Jones' backing vocals can be heard on many of his productions.
Jones is also the founder of the record label Zone 4, which was briefly an imprint of Iovine's Interscope Records label and named after a section in his Atlanta hometown. Established in 2007, the roster included recording artists such as Keri Hilson, Lloyd, Kane Brown, Ayo &amp; Teo, Roscoe Dash, Veronica Vega, Rich Boy, and Ester Dean among others. Outside of music, Jones has ventured into local radio broadcasting, and founded his own line of alcoholic beverages in 2022.
Personal life.
In September 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump gave Jones a shout-out at a rally in Atlanta. Jones later substantiated his support for the President with a video posted on Instagram.
Broadcasting.
In 2019, via his company Young Country Holdings, Jones entered the broadcasting industry by purchasing the Nashville-area radio station WYCZ and its FM translator for $100,000. On June 6, 2019, the station launched a new hybrid country, pop, and urban format curated by Jones, "YoCo 96.7".

Cuvier's dwarf caiman

Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus) is a small crocodilian in the alligator family from northern and central South America. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Venezuela. It lives in riverine forests, flooded forests near lakes, and near fast-flowing rivers and streams. It can traverse dry land to reach temporary pools and tolerates colder water than other species of caimans. Other common names for this species include the musky caiman, the dwarf caiman, Cuvier's caiman, and the smooth-fronted caiman (the latter name is also used for "P. trigonatus"). It is sometimes kept in captivity as a pet and may be referred to as the wedge-head caiman by the pet trade community.
Cuvier's dwarf caiman was first described by the French zoologist Georges Cuvier in 1807 and is one of only two species in the genus "Paleosuchus", the other species being "P. trigonatus". Their closest relatives are the other caimans in the subfamily Caimaninae. With a total length averaging for males and up to for females, Cuvier's dwarf caiman is not only the smallest extant species in the alligator and caiman family, but also the smallest of all crocodilians (unless the Congo dwarf crocodile is considered a valid species). An adult weighs around . Its lack of size is partly made up for by its strong body armor, provided by the bony bases to its dermal scales, which provides protection against predators. Juvenile dwarf caimans mainly feed on invertebrates, but also small fish and frogs, while adults eat larger fish, amphibians, and invertebrates, such as large molluscs. This caiman sometimes uses a burrow as shelter during the day and in the Pantanal may aestivate in the burrow to stay cool in the dry season. The female buries her eggs on a mounded nest and these take about 3 months to hatch. She helps the hatchlings to escape from the nest and provides some parental care for the first few weeks of their lives. This caiman has a wide range and large total population and the IUCN lists its conservation status as being of least concern.
Etymology.
The genus name "Paleosuchus" is derived from the Greek "palaios" meaning "ancient" and "soukhos" meaning "crocodile". This refers to the belief that this crocodile comes from an ancient lineage that diverged from other species of caimans some 30 million years ago. The specific name "palpebrosus" is derived from the Latin "palpebra" meaning "eyelid" and "osus" meaning "full of". This refers to the bony plates (palpebrals) present on the upper eyelids.
Common names include the musky caiman, the dwarf caiman, Cuvier's caiman, and the smooth-fronted caiman, although the last of these is also used to refer to the closely related "P. trigonatus". In the pet trade, it is sometimes referred to as the wedge-head caiman.
Discovery and taxonomy.
Cuvier's dwarf caiman was first described by Cuvier in 1807 as "Crocodylus palpebrosus" from a type locality described as "Cayenne". Since then, it has been given a number of names by different authorities: "Crocodilus (Alligator) palpebrosus" (Merrem, 1820), "Jacaretinga moschifer" (Spix, 1825), "Champsa palpebrosa" (Wagler, 1830), "Alligator palpebrosus" (Dumeril and Bibron, 1836), "Champsa gibbiceps" (Natterer, 1841), "Caiman palpebrosus" (Gray, 1844), "Caiman (Aromosuchus) palpebrosus" (Gray, 1862), and "Jacaretinga palpebrosus" (Vaillant, 1898). Muller, in 1924, and Schmidt, in 1928, were the first to use the currently accepted name of "Paleosuchus palpebrosus". No subspecies are recognised.
At present, the genus "Paleosuchus" contains only two members, "Paleosuchus trigonatus", commonly known as the smooth-fronted or Schneider's dwarf caiman, and "P. palpebrosus", both from South America. "Paleosuchus" is distinguished from other caimans in the alligator subfamily Caimaninae by the absence of an interorbital ridge and the presence of four teeth in the premaxilla region of the jaw, where other species of caimans have five.
The relationships of extant (living) caimans can be shown in the cladogram below, based on molecular DNA-based phylogenetic studies:
A genetic study in 2012 found clear differences between various populations of Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Pantanal; Madeira River basin; Rio Negro basin), and these are apparently isolated from each other, leading to the suggestion that it may be a cryptic species complex.
Description.
Cuvier's dwarf caiman is the smallest living New World crocodilian. Males grow to a maximum length around while females do not usually exceed . The largest specimen on record measured in length. This may be an underestimate of the animal's maximum size, as nearly all large adults have lost the tips of their tails and the largest specimen measured in the Pantanal region had a snout–vent length of (equivalent to a total length of with an intact tail). An adult typically weighs around , around the same weight as a 6- to 12-month-old specimen of several larger species of crocodilians. Large adults of this species can weigh up to . Cuvier's dwarf caiman has strong body armor on both its dorsal (upper) and ventral (lower) sides, which may compensate for its small body size in reducing predation. The dermal scales providing this protection have a bony base and are known as osteoderms.
The head has an unusual shape for a crocodilian, with a dome-shaped skull and a short, smooth, concave snout with an upturned tip, the shape rather resembling the head of a dog. The upper jaw extends markedly further forward than the lower jaw. Four premaxillary and 14 to 15 maxillary teeth are on either side of the upper jaw and 21 or 22 teeth on each side of the lower jaw, giving a total of about 80 teeth. The neck is relatively slender and the dorsal scutes are less prominent than in the smooth-fronted caiman. The double rows of scutes on the tail are small and project vertically. Adults are dark brownish-black with a dark brown head, while juveniles are brown with black bands. The irises of the eyes are chestnut brown at all ages and the pupils are vertical slits.The scutellation (arrangement of the scales) helps to distinguish Cuvier's dwarf caiman from Schneider's dwarf caiman.
Distribution and habitat.
Cuvier's dwarf caiman is native to tropical northern and central South America. It is present in the drainages of the Orinoco River, the São Francisco River, and the Amazon River, and the upper reaches of the Paraná River and the Paraguay River. The countries in which it is found include Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Trinidad and Paraguay. The range of this species is rather larger than that of the sympatric smooth-fronted caiman, as it extends into Paraguay and includes a larger area of Brazil. They also follow seasonal fluctuations in water-level, while the smooth-fronted caiman does not, which may explain how the two species are able to live in sympatry. 
Cuvier's dwarf caiman is a freshwater species and is found in forested riverine habitats and areas of flooded forest around lakes. It seems to prefer rivers and streams with fast-flowing water, but it is also found in quiet, nutrient-poor waters in Venezuela and southeastern Brazil. It is able to travel quite large distances overland at night and subadult individuals have sometimes been found in isolated, temporary pools. In the northern and southern parts of its range, it is also found in gallery forests in savanna country, but it is absent from such habitats in the Llanos and the Pantanal. Cuvier's dwarf caiman seems relatively tolerant of cool water compared to other species of caimans. During the day, individuals sometimes lie up in burrows but at other times rest on piles of rocks or sun themselves while lying, facing the sun, in shallow water with their backs exposed.
Behaviour and ecology.
These caimans are mainly nocturnal. Because they occupy many different microhabitats, their diet is believed to vary regionally. Adults feed on fish, amphibians, small mammals, birds, crabs, shrimp, molluscs, insects, and other invertebrates, which they catch in the water or on land. Juveniles eat fewer fish, but also consume crustaceans, tadpoles, frogs, and snails, as well as land invertebrates, such as beetles. The prey is mostly swallowed whole and is ground up by stones in the gizzard. In the Pantanal, Cuvier's dwarf caiman estivates in burrows during the dry season and is able to maintain its temperature around for days at a time.
Adult Cuvier's dwarf caimans are usually found singly or in pairs. The breeding of this species has been little studied, but it does not appear to be seasonal in nature. The female builds a mound nest out of vegetation and mud somewhere in a concealed location and lays a clutch of 10 to 25 eggs, hiding them under further vegetation. Nest temperature varies between and are heated by decaying vegetation. The incubation period is around 90 days and the sex of the hatchlings depends on the temperature of the nest during that time. When the eggs begin to hatch, the female opens the nest in response to the calls made by the young. Newly emerged juveniles have a coating of mucus and may delay entering the water for a few days until this has dried. Its continuing presence on their skin is believed to reduce algal growth. The female stays with the young for around a year, with the longest recorded care extending to 21 months. After this the hatchlings disperse. The young grow at a rate around per year. Females reach sexual maturity around 8 years old and males around 6 years old.
Cuvier's dwarf caiman is considered to be a keystone species whose presence in the ecosystem maintains a healthy balance of organisms. In its absence, fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment. The eggs and newly hatched young are most at risk and are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, raccoons, and other mammals. Adults are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas ("Eunectes murinus"), and large boa constrictors ("Boa constrictor").
The Cuvier's dwarf caiman is the only crocodilian species that seemingly does not perform the near-universal "death roll" technique used by other extant crocodilians for feeding or intra-specific combat. However, this may only be circumstantial, as specimens tested for the behavior may have been acting uncooperatively with the researchers.
Status and conservation.
Many crocodilians are hunted for their skins, but this is not the case with the Cuvier's dwarf caiman. This may be because the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armored to make it easy to tan. Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and some traditional South American cultures believe dwarf caiman teeth protect from snake bites. Others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but no evidence shows that populations are dwindling as a result. Some threats to this species are from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over a million individuals.
In its Red List of Threatened Species, the IUCN lists Cuvier's dwarf caiman as being of least concern, which is because its range is extensive, covering much of northern and central South America, and although its population trend is unknown, it appears to be abundant in many of the localities in which it is found. It is listed in Appendix II of CITES.
Captive care.
Cuvier's dwarf caiman can be kept as a pet, though providing suitable care is expensive and requires extremely large enclosures. In many countries, permits or licenses are necessary and most veterinarians have little experience with these exotic animals.

In April 2022, the popular reality show MTV Roadies - Season 18 was hosted by Sonu Sood in South Africa. As he reflected on the experience, he emphasized that the "magic" attribute of the show was that it demanded one to be absolutely real &amp; every single day of our 45-day stay in South Africa was a learning experience for him.
Personal life.
In 1996, Sood married Sonali, a Telugu lady, who hails from Andhra Pradesh. They have two sons named Ayaan and Ishant. He is an eggetarian.
Philanthropy.
Sood Charity Foundation.
Sood has founded the Sood Charity Foundation "to help people of all stature". An initiative by Sood for providing free coaching to UPSC exam candidates from underprivileged financial backgrounds. Sood was announced as the Delhi Government's brand ambassador of its "Desh ke Mentor" ("country mentor") programme by the Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on 27 August 2021.
SANKALP is one of the flagship campaigns of the Sood Charity Foundation. It is a free law entrance coaching program to assist people with academic guidance and other essential resources for CLAT and AILET exam preparation. The goal has been to bridge the gap between the less-privileged deserving candidates and Law schools.
The train accident in Odisha's Balasore resulted in the death of over 250 people and left more than 1,000 injured. Sonu launched Helpline For Odisha Train Accident Victims and requests the government to set up a relief fund.
Fraudsters impersonating Sood Charity Foundation.
Across the country there are many volunteers and agents who have possibly associated to support the work of the organization and have started contacting people via twitter, Facebook and Instagram to impersonate Sonu Sood and Sonali Sood and are collecting fees in his name. They take the money online via bank transfers and later withdraw the money via ATM machines. Reports also suggest that they spoof emails of Sood Charity Foundation. The Foundation has not actively taken steps to ensure this stops and contacting the foundation senior management is near impossible to most civilians.
Social work during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In May 2020, during the nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sood helped thousands of stranded Indian migrant workers to reach their homes by arranging buses, special trains and chartered flights for them. In July 2020 he arranged a chartered flight to bring home over 1,500 Indian students stranded in Kyrgyzstan, flying them from Bishkek to Varanasi. His charity during the pandemic was lauded, and he was hailed as a real-life hero in India.
On 25 July 2020, a video of a farmer's daughters ploughing a field, like bulls with a yoke on their shoulders, went viral over social media. Sood quickly sent the family a tractor. On 5 August 2020, he helped 101 medical students, predominantly from Tamil Nadu, who were stranded in Moscow during the lockdown, reach Chennai safely on a chartered flight arranged by him after they contacted his team for help. On his birthday he launched a website and app called Pravasi Rojgar to help migrant workers find suitable jobs amid the pandemic. On 19 February 2021, Sood launched an initiative 'Ilaaj India' platform to provide healthcare services for needy people. In December 2020 he published "I Am No Messiah", autobiographical book, narrating his journey to become an actor, and narrating his social work during the pandemic.
On 17 April 2021, Sonu Sood tested positive for COVID-19. He also shared a message for his fans in his post that read: "Covid – positive. Mood and spirit – super positive. Hi everyone, this is to inform you that I have tested positive this morning for COVID-19. As a part of precautions, I have already quarantined myself and taking utmost care. But don't worry this gives me ample time to solve your problems. Remember I am always there for you all."
In 2021, Sood provided much-needed oxygen plants and cylinders for COVID-19 patients in India. Sood and Kumar Vishwas have supported the "Aao Gaon Bachayein" ("Save the Villages") campaign started by comic poet and satirist Pankaj Prasun.

South Indian cuisine includes the cuisines of the five southern states of India—Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana—and the union territories of Lakshadweep and Pondicherry. There are typically vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes for all five states. All regions have typical main dishes, snacks, light meals, desserts, and drinks.
Regional cuisines of South India include: 
There are also several regional sub-types of cuisine within these states. Among notable sub-types of regional cuisine are Udupi cuisine, Chettinad cuisine, Hyderabadi cuisine, Thalassery cuisine, Saraswat cuisine, and Mangalorean Catholic cuisine. South Indian cuisine shares similarities with the cuisines of Sri Lanka and the Maldives due to a similar geographic location and culture.
Early culinary texts.
According to culinary historians K. T. Achaya and Ammini Ramachandran, the ancient Sangam literature dated from 3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE offers early references to food and recipes during Sangam era, whether it's a feast at king's palace, meals in towns and countryside, at hamlets in forests, pilgrimage and the rest-houses during travels. It describes cuisine of various landscapes and people who reside there, how they prepared food and what they served their guests in details. Poet Avvaiyar for example describes her hearty summer lunch as "steamed rice, smoked and mashed aubergine and tangy frothy buttermilk", while poet named Mudathama Kanniyar describes "Skewered goat meat, crispy fried vegetables, rice and over 16 varieties of dishes" as part of the royal lunch he was treated to in the palace of the Chola king. Sangam literature also offers references to food being eaten on several different types of leaf platters and thalis with several bowls. Sangam period archeological sites like Tirunelveli has uncovered notable household bronzeware utensils including "ornamental vase stands, bowls, jars and cups of different patterns with ornamental bowl lids" which were likely used for thali presentation as described in Sangam texts.
Several notable Indian cookbooks were written in southern India during medieval period, these include "Lokopakara" (1025 CE), "Manasollasa" (1130 CE), "Soopa Shastra" (1508 CE), "Bhojana Kutuhala" (1675 CE), "Sivatattva Ratnakara" (1699 CE), among others. These cookbooks contains both vegetarian and non-vegetarian cuisines, with exception of Soopa Shastra which is a Jain vegetarian cookbook. 
Maritime trade.
Indian Ocean trade played important role in spread of Indian spices to western world during classical era. Black pepper is native to the Malabar Coast of India, and the Malabar pepper is extensively cultivated there. During classical era, spices like black pepper, cinnamon, cardamom and fragrant woods like sandalwood and agarwood were part of Indo-Roman trade network from the ancient port of Muziris in the southwestern coast of India. During Middle Ages prior to the Age of Discovery which began with the end of the 15th century CE, the kingdom of Calicut (Kozhikode) on Malabar Coast was the centre of Indian pepper exports to the Red Sea and Europe at this time with Arab traders being particularly active. Tomatoes and chili peppers were introduced by Portuguese and "English Vegetables" (cabbage, cauliflower, turnip etc.) as they were at one time termed, became part of local cuisine by late 1800s.

On the Banks of the Old Raritan

"On the Banks of the Old Raritan" is a song, or "alma mater", associated with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (previously Rutgers College and Rutgers University), in the United States. The original lyrics were written in 1873 by Howard Newton Fuller, an 1874 graduate of Rutgers College. Fuller quickly prepared the song as a school hymn for the college's Glee Club, an all-male choral ensemble, before a performance in Metuchen, New Jersey. Fuller chose to set the lyrics to the tune of melody, "On the Banks of the Old Dundee", a popular Scottish melody regarded as a drinking song, and titled the song for the Raritan River.
Composition and history.
Rutgers College student Edwin E. Colburn (class of 1876) organized the college's Glee Club, an all-male choral ensemble, after noticing that Rutgers was not included when the first edition of the "Carmina Collegensia" (1869) was published and advertised as a complete collection of American college songs. In 1873, on the night of a performance in Metuchen, New Jersey, Colburn approached his fellow student Howard Newton Fuller (1853– ), to compose a tune and some lyrics that the club could use as an official school song, or "alma mater".
Fuller wrote the lyrics in two hours setting them to the tune of a popular melody "On the Banks of the Old Dundee." According to a later interview with the "Rutgers Alumni Monthly", Fuller stated he chose "On the Banks of the Old Dundee" as the song "immediately struck me that the air of that song had the right melody and the stirring and martial swing for an effective college song."
"On the Banks of the Old Raritan" and thirteen other Rutgers songs appeared in the second edition of the "Carmina Collegensia", published in 1876.
It is often sung at university occasions, including performances of the Rutgers University Glee Club, and other campus musical groups, at convocation and commencement exercises, and especially at the conclusion of athletic events.
Lyrics.
While there are five verses to the song, typically only the first and last (fifth) verse are sung.
Revised lyrics (1914)
Original lyrics (1873)
In 1989, several years after Rutgers became coeducational (1972), the University's administration changed the official lyrics to reflect to be gender-neutral, substituting the words "my friends" in place of Fuller's original words "my boys" in the first line of the chorus.
In August 2013, The Rutgers University Glee Club debuted a revision to the first verse, written by Rutgers Director of Choral Studies Patrick Gardner. The lyrics, "My father sent me to old Rutgers, and resolved that I should be a man" has been changed to a gender-neutral "From far and near we came to Rutgers, and resolved to learn all that we can." The following line was also changed to "we settled down" instead of "I settled down". These lyrics were carefully changed so that whether you choose to sing the Howard Fuller 1873 lyrics or the gender-inclusive revision, the vowel color are unified across both. (I.E. "Father" matches "Far", the word "resolved" remained the same, "man" and "can", etc.) The revision has been accepted by the university. 
Over the years, several organizations on campus have penned additional verses, informal interjections, as well as parodies of these lyrics.
Camden campus alma mater.
An altered version of the song with lyrics by alums Kenneth E. Kendall and Julie E. Kendall is sung as the Rutgers University-Camden alma mater, incorporating the lyrics "on the banks of the old Delaware" and references to the Camden-based poet Walt Whitman.

Crop art

Crop art is an environmental art practice using plants and seeds in the landscape to create statements, marks and/or images. Agnes Denes, Matthew Moore (artist), Dennis Oppenheim and Stan Herd are practitioners of Crop art. Some works of Land art, and Earth art are similar in scale, and can be seen only from aerial viewpoints.
Historical precedents.
One folk art version of crop art is called seed art, a visual art form created in mosaic-style, similar to the technique of pointillism in painting, or needlepoint textiles. Seed mosaic images are created by fixing vegetable matter, especially seeds, to a background. Coleen Sheehy, in "Seed Queen" quotes a classic text on the subject: "Decorating with Seed mosaics, Chipped Glass and Plant materials" (first pub.1960) by Elenor Van Rennslaer "...mosaics are tiles, glass, or stones set in mortar. Instead of these you can create a different kind of mosaic using such plant materials as seeds, tiny pods, and flowers" (Sheehy 49).
An example is the Corn Palace of Mitchell, South Dakota, that was first built for the 1892 Corn Exposition. Outer walls of the building were -and still are- covered in murals made from multi-colored ears of corn (Sheehy 24) The seed mosaic portraits by Lillian Colton are also examples. Her seed portraits of celebrities were exhibited in the strictly defined "Crop art" category at the Minnesota State Fair beginning in 1966. Rules for entry of Crop art allow "only seeds from Minnesota-grown farm crops or cultivated garden flowers, fruits, and vegetables" with no wild plant seeds permitted. Colton continued to teach and make Crop art until her death at age 97 in 2007 (Sheehy 2). A new generation of Crop, or Seed artists, known as the "Postmodern School of Minnesota Crop Art" (Sheehy 90) is continuing this folk tradition. Some of these artists are "Cathy Camper, Alan Carpenter, Kim Cope, Linda Koutsky, Nancy Loung, Suzy Mears, Laura Melnick, and David Steinlicht" (Sheehy 90). There is a custodial aspect and preservation ethic associated with this plant-based art form. Making Crop art is not only a way preserving and rejuvenating a vibrant folk craft but its practice foregrounds the need to collect, store, and value the lore and varieties of seeds.
In Los Angeles, the Tournament of Roses Parade floats employ the flowers of plants in a similar collage or mosaic style.
Crop circles.
The term crop art might be used to describe formations known as crop circles. Crop circles first came to mass media attention during the 1980s after they were noticed in some agricultural fields in southern England (Ency Rel/Spir). Most often the images consist of very large and intricate series of rings and lines formed when standing crops, such as wheat and rye are flattened into patterns. Some attribute these designs to the marks left by landings of extraterrestrial craft because the images are usually very large, appear over a short period of time, and some do not show any visible tracks into or out of the design. These same type of figures are found all over the world; though many do not attribute their manifestation to visitations by alien beings. Crop circles are sometimes called crop formations, agroglyphs, or pictograms. Some are also created by recognized "landscape artists" for commercial purposes.

Good Hearted Woman

Good Hearted Woman is a studio album by American country music artist Waylon Jennings, released in 1972 on RCA Nashville.
Background.
Along with "Ladies Love Outlaws", released later in 1972, and "Lonesome, On'ry and Mean" (released early the following year), "Good Hearted Woman" was responsible for transforming Jennings' image into that of one of the representatives of the outlaw country movement. The LP contains a slew of songs written by like-minded songwriters such as Willie Nelson, Tony Joe White and Kris Kristofferson, whose compositions were pushing the boundaries of the conservative country music establishment. Jennings, who had been frustrated by the assembly line production at RCA for years, became a leading force in what was being called "progressive country" music. In the audio version of his autobiography "Waylon", the singer recalls his frustration: "I would think of ideas and before I got a chance to put 'em down - or even hear if they even worked - they'd tell me I was wrong. I'd say, 'What the fuck ya mean, it's wrong?' 'Well, it'll make the record skip, if we put that big drum beat on it. We don't understand that rhythm. We have to smooth it out or we'll never get played on radio.' And the best one was, 'That's not country.' I always hated labels, and they kept trying to stick one on me."
Recording and composition.
"Good Hearted Woman" was produced by Ronny Light, who was appointed by Chet Atkins to produce Waylon after Danny Davis left to work with his brass ensemble. In his autobiography, Jennings, who had developed a chip on his shoulder regarding producers, admitted to badgering the young producer during the sessions: "Ronny was young, one of the nicest people in the world, and didn't deserve the misery I put him through. I got more freedom with him as a producer, although I was still using musicians who didn't know what I was about."
The album's most famous song is the title track, which has since become a country classic. In 1969, while staying at the Fort Worther Motel in Fort Worth, Texas, Jennings was inspired to start writing the song when he saw advertising on a newspaper promoting Tina Turner as a "good hearted woman loving a two-timing man", a reference to Ike Turner. Jennings went to talk to Willie Nelson, who was in a middle of a poker game, and told Nelson about his idea. While they kept playing, they expanded the lyrics as Nelson's wife Connie Koepke was writing them down. The extent of Nelson's contribution remains open to question, however. In the authorized Jennings video biography "Renegade Outlaw Legend", Nelson admits, "I think he had most of that song written. We were in a poker game and he said, 'Hey, I'm writin' a song,' so we laid out of the poker game for a few hands. I think I gave him a line or two and wound up with half the song." In Michael Striessguth's book "Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville", Jennings guitarist Billy Ray Reynolds insists that Waylon approached him to work on the song around the same time but Reynolds refused, feeling that the song was finished: "The next day or so, he got into a poker game and he did the same thing to Willie. And Waylon even suggested the line that Willie is supposed to have written. It was Waylon's line and Willie said, 'Hey, I like that.' So Willie wound up with half the song and half the publishing. I don't want to make Willie mad at me, but Waylon already had that song written." It soared to #3 on the country singles chart, followed by "Sweet Dream Woman," which reached #7. Jennings also recorded the Nelson composition "It Should Be Easier Now" and the metaphorical Kristofferson's tune "To Beat the Devil." In 2013, author Michael Striessguth wrote that Jennings "painted the song with authenticity that could only come from a childhood in poverty and ten years of hard living on the road; indeed, it was one of the first times anybody could sit back and say, 'Waylon nailed that one.'" Jennings also contributed "Do No Good Woman" to the album.
The original liner notes were written by Willie Nelson and describe the first time Jennings and Nelson met in Phoenix, Arizona. The album was reissued in 1978 by RCA (AYL1-3737) with the same track listing, but different cover art. Nelson's back cover liner notes were not included.
Critical reception.
The album peaked at #7 on the "Billboard" country albums chart. AllMusic: "In sum, "Good Hearted Woman" is a pretty sensational outing for Jennings; he's feeling his power here, and as the door opened just one more crack, the listener can hear how it never closed again."

Smooth-fronted caiman

The smooth-fronted caiman (Paleosuchus trigonatus), also known as Schneider's dwarf caiman or Schneider's smooth-fronted caiman, is a crocodilian from South America, where it is native to the Amazon and Orinoco Basins. It is the second-smallest species of the family Alligatoridae, the smallest being Cuvier's dwarf caiman, also from tropical South America and in the same genus. An adult typically grows to around in length and weighs between . Exceptionally large males can reach as much as in length and in weight.
Etymology.
The smooth-fronted caiman was first described by the German classicist and naturalist Johann Gottlob Schneider in 1801. The genus name "Paleosuchus" is derived from the Greek "palaios" meaning "ancient" and "soukhos" meaning "crocodile". This refers to the belief that this crocodile comes from an ancient lineage that diverged from other species of caimans some 30 million years ago. The specific name "trigonatus" is derived from the Greek "trigonos" meaning "three-cornered" and Latin "atus" meaning "provided with" and refers to the triangular shape of the head.
Classification.
At present, the genus "Paleosuchus" contains only one other member: Cuvier's dwarf caiman ("Paleosuchus palpebrosus"), also from South America. "Paleosuchus" is distinguished from other caimans in the subfamily Caimaninae by the absence of an interorbital ridge and the presence of four teeth in the premaxilla region of the jaw, where other species of caimans have five. The relationships of extant (living) caimans can be shown in the cladogram below, based on molecular DNA-based phylogenetic studies:
Description.
The head of the smooth-fronted caiman is similar in appearance to that of the spectacled caiman ("Caiman crocodilus"), but no bony ridge or "spectacle" occurs between the eyes. The scutes on the back of the neck and the tail are large, triangular, and sharp. It has heavily ossified body armour on both its dorsal and ventral surfaces. The relatively short tail is broad at its base and flattened dorsoventrally in contrast to most species of crocodilians which have laterally flattened tails. The bony scutes on the tail have sideways projections; and the tail is so well armoured, that it is relatively inflexible. This caiman is a dark greyish-brown with mid-brown eyes. Males grow to about long, with the largest recorded specimen being . Females do not often exceed . It is a robust crocodilian, strong for its size, and tends to carry its head high with its neck angled upwards.
Distribution and habitat.
The smooth-fronted caiman is native to the Amazon and Orinoco Basins in South America and is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. It inhabits small streams in forested areas where in some cases, the water may be insufficiently deep for it to completely submerge itself. It is seldom seen in open areas and does not usually bask in the sun, even in captivity.
Behaviour and life history.
The adult smooth-fronted caiman has cryptic habits and is seldom observed by day because it hides in underwater burrows or may spend much of its time up to away from water, concealed in dense undergrowth, in hollow logs, or under fallen trees. Males are territorial and females have small home ranges. Adults are semiterrestrial and mainly feed on such animals as porcupines, pacas, snakes, birds, and lizards, consuming few fish or molluscs. Hatchlings feed mainly on insects and other arthropods in their first few weeks, graduating to larger prey as they grow, such as small fish, birds, and reptiles. Juvenile mortality is high, but adult mortality is low, although large carnivores such as the jaguar sometimes prey on them.
Females become mature and start to breed at about 11 years and males at about 20. The female builds a large mound nest out of leaf litter and soil at the end of the dry season or may use a pre-existing nest. A clutch of 10 to 15 eggs is laid and covered with further nesting material. Some heat is generated by the decaying vegetation and good insulation helps to retain this. The nests are often built against the sides of termite mounds and metabolic heat generated by the termites helps to maintain the clutch at a near constant temperature. The eggs need to be maintained at a temperature of for the production of male offspring. The incubation period is about 115 days and the female caiman remains near the nest for at least the earlier part of this time, providing protection against predators. During incubation, roots may grow through the nest, and soil from the termite mound may cement the eggs together. This means parental assistance is necessary when the eggs hatch to enable the hatchlings to escape from the nest chamber. Having transported the newly emerged juveniles to a nursery area, the female stays with them for a few weeks after which time they disperse. The female may miss a year before breeding again.
Status and conservation.
The smooth-fronted caiman is not extensively hunted because its skin contains many bony scutes, which make it of little use for leather. The animals are collected in Guyana, however, for the pet trade. The main threats to this species are destruction of its forest habitat and pollution of its environment by gold mining activities. Over one million individuals are estimated to remain in the wild, and the species is rated by the IUCN as being of least concern. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES which is designed to limit overexploitation through international trade.

Hyacinthe Loyson

Charles Jean Marie Loyson (10 March 1827 – 9 February 1912), better known by his religious name Père Hyacinthe, was a famous French preacher and theologian. He was a Roman Catholic priest who had been a Sulpician and a Dominican novice before becoming a Discalced Carmelite and provincial of his order, but left the Roman Catholic Church, in 1869, after major excommunication was pronounced against him. He was known especially for his eloquent sermons at Notre Dame de Paris and sought to reconcile Catholicism with modern ideas.
Biography.
Loyson was born in Orléans, France, on 10 March 1827. He was baptised Charles Jean Marie; named after the poet Charles Loyson, his uncle. He was educated in Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, by private professors where his father was rector of the university. His mother was of the noble Burnier-Fontonel family of the Chateau de Reiquier, Savoy. One brother, Jules Theodore Loyson, became a priest and professor at the Collège de Sorbonne in Paris, and one sister became a nun.
In 1845, he entered the seminary of Saint-Sulpice, Paris and was ordained four years later. He successively taught philosophy at the seminary in Avignon, and theology at the seminary in Nantes and officiated in his ecclesiastical capacity at Saint-Sulpice. He eventually resigned his post to assume the vows of a friar of the Order of the Carmelites, taking the religious name of Hyacinthe. He then spent two years in the Carmelite convent in Lyon, and attracted much attention by his preaching at the Lycée in Lyons.
As a preacher in Lyon and Bordeaux, Loyson acquired his reputation as the most effective pulpit orator of his day; and his success soon afterwards induced him to seek the more critical audiences of Paris, where Loyson further established his fame at the Église de la Madeleine and Notre Dame de Paris. Mullinger wrote that Loyson's "resonant voice and impassioned rhetoric possess, especially for his own countrymen, a powerful charm." His eloquence drew all Paris to his Advent sermons in Notre Dame de Paris between 1865 and 1869, but his orthodoxy fell under suspicion. In 1868, he was summoned to Rome and was ordered to stop preaching on any controversial subject, and to confine himself exclusively to those subjects upon which all Roman Catholics were united in belief.
In June 1869, Loyson delivered an address before the Ligue internationale de la paix, which was founded by Frédéric Passy, in which he spoke of the Jewish religion, the Catholic religion, and the Protestant religion, as being the three great religions of civilized peoples; this expression elicited severe censures from the Catholic press. In 1869, he protested against the manner in which the First Vatican Council was convened.
He was ordered to retract, but he refused and broke with his order in an open letter of 20 September 1869, addressed to the General of the Discalced Carmelites, but evidently intended for the governing powers of the Church. In it he protested against the "sacrilegious perversion of the Gospel", and went on to say: "It is my profound conviction that if France in particular and the Latin races in general, are given up to social, moral, and religious anarchy, the principal cause is not Catholicism itself, but the manner in which Catholicism has for a long time been understood and practised." His manifesto against the alleged abuses in the Church created intense excitement, not only in France, but throughout the civilized world, and the young monk was hailed as a powerful ally by all the open opponents of the Papacy.
He was excommunicated and resumed his name as Charles Loyson. Soon after, he left France for America, landing in New York City on 18 October 1869. He was warmly welcomed by the leading members of the various Protestant sects in the United States, and though he fraternized with them to a certain extent, he constantly declared that he had no intention of quitting the Catholic Faith. In 1870 he associated himself with Ignaz von Döllinger's protest against the dogma of Papal infallibility.
On 3 September 1872, he was married in London at the Marylebone Registry Office, to Emilie Jane Butterfield Meriman, daughter of Amory Butterfield and widow of Edwin Ruthven Meriman of the United States; the Dean of Westminster, Arthur Stanley, and Lady Augusta Stanley, his wife, were present. He claimed that in 1872, before he was publicly married in England, he had his marriage privately blessed in Rome by Archbishop Luigi Puecher Passavalli.
A law was enacted that restricted episcopal and parochial jurisdiction in the canton unless sanctioned by the government; and that, for the future, all parish priests should be elected by the Catholic inhabitants, and be removed, if shown sufficient cause, by the State. The canton was divided into twenty-three parishes, three of which were in Geneva; and in the following March, Loyson was invited by the Old Catholics to lecture in Geneva. In a series of discourses he boldly advocated a complete system of Church reform, to be carried out in conjunction with the Old Catholic party.
He urged that every nation establish a national Christian Church and the different established Churches become an international confederation. His views and talents were regarded favorably. Loyson was elected, by liberal Catholics, in the following October, in 1873, along with Hurtault and Chavard, to the three vacant parishes in Geneva. It was impossible for the bishop to retaliate under Swiss law. In 1874, he introduced reforms in worship and soon had to resign. Identified as one of the Old Catholics, Loyson continued to write and preach and ultimately settled in Paris in 1877 and established as a separate church the Église gallicane, which drew upon the long French tradition of Gallicanism.
He died in February 1912, in Paris, in the apartment of his playwright son, Paul Hyacinthe Loyson, and was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

Swedish Cricket Federation

Cricket Sweden () was established in 1990, and is the administrative organisation for all cricket in Sweden. The Swedish Cricket Federation is an associate member of the International Cricket Council. In 1998, there were approx. 500 registered cricket players in Sweden. In 2016 Radio Sweden reported there was an estimated 55 teams and 3,000 registered players; the surge, similar to that in Germany, has been attributed to an influx of immigrants from Afghanistan and other cricket-loving countries. The social side of the game has been praised for its ability to integrate new arrivals. In 2015 the Swedish Cricket Federation joined the Swedish Sports Confederation. While gaining in popularity, it is said that the game still lags behind cricket in Norway in popularity.
History.
In 1883 the first cricket club, Lyckans Samfund, was founded in Gothenburg by cricket enthusiasts. The oldest cricket club founded in modern times in Sweden is the Stockholm Cricket Club.
Development of cricket was slow during the 1950s and 1960s, with players predominantly being expats. Since the 1970s growth of cricket in Sweden has been tied to waves of immigration and refugees settling in Sweden, with Ugandan Indians, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, most recently Afghani immigrants driving the increase in playing numbers.
The Swedish Cricket Federation was formed in 1990. In 1991 the Swedish Cricket Federation joined the ICC and was made an affiliate member in 1997. The Swedish Cricket Federation was accepted as the 71st member of the Swedish Sports Confederation () in 2015.
National Team.
The Sweden national cricket teams represent the Kingdom of Sweden in international cricket. Sweden is represented by teams for Men, Women and U19.
Club Cricket.
There are 70 cricket clubs in Sweden affiliated to the Swedish Cricket Federation. Currently 56 play in the Cricket Ligan - the national club cricket competition in Sweden for One Day, T20 and T10 formats. Cricket Ligan’s highest division is the Allsvenskan, under which are 2 levels of regional competitions. The winner of the Swedish T10 competition is eligible to represent Sweden in the European Cricket League.

The Sheepman

The Sheepman is a 1958 American Western comedy film directed by George Marshall and starring Glenn Ford, Shirley MacLaine, and Leslie Nielsen.
Plot.
Gambler Jason Sweet wins a flock of sheep in a poker game and proceeds to take them by train into the middle of cattle country. Before long, the townsfolk take notice (and object), but Sweet is more than up to the challenge.
The first thing he does is pick a fight with the roughest, toughest man around, "Jumbo" McCall, and beats him up. He also reveals himself to be an expert with a gun. Dell Payton does not know what to make of him, but is attracted to him, as he is to her. Her fiancé, local cattle baron "Colonel" Steven Bedford, is troubled by this, and also because Sweet and he know each other. The newcomer recognizes Bedford as an old acquaintance named Johnny Bledsoe, a card shark and gunfighter gone respectable.
When Bedford finds himself losing their battle for domination, despite initially having the whole town behind him, he sends for Chocktaw Neal. Chocktaw and his two buddies all have grudges against Sweet, while Sweet has been searching for Chocktaw to settle a score. Chocktaw tries to goad Sweet into a shootout, but Sweet spots Chocktaw's friends waiting in ambush with their rifles. Dell and Milt Masters are able to disarm them, and Chocktaw, suddenly aware he is alone, panics and draws on Sweet, but loses and dies. The final showdown then comes down to Bedford and Sweet, and Bedford ends up dead.
Later, to Dell's utter astonishment, Sweet sells the sheep so he can buy cattle. He explains that he only kept them because he refused to be pushed around by anybody. The couple then rides away.
Box office.
According to MGM records, the film earned $1,535,000 in the US and Canada and $2.2 million elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $976,000.
Award nominations.
William Bowers and James Edward Grant were nominated for an Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen.
The two BAFTA nominations were: Best Film from any source, and Glenn Ford for Best Foreign Actor.

VAZ-2101

The VAZ-2101 "Zhiguli", commonly nicknamed "Kopeyka" (for the smallest Soviet coin, 1/100 of the Russian ruble), is a compact 4-door sedan or wagon, called "small class, passenger car, model 1" in Soviet classification, and produced by the Soviet manufacturer AvtoVAZ, introduced in 1970 as the company's first product.
The car is a licence-built version of the Fiat 124, that was heavily modified and tailored for the rough climate and road conditions across the Soviet Union and much of the Eastern Bloc countries. Subsequently, it was widely, and successfully exported to the West under the Lada brand, for over two decades. The station wagon version (correspondingly based on the Fiat 124 "Familiare") was known as the VAZ-2102.
Development.
The lightweight Italian Fiat 124, which had won the 1967 European Car of the Year, was adapted in order to survive treacherous Russian driving conditions. Among many changes, aluminium brake drums were added to the rear, and the original Fiat engine was dropped in favour of a newer design made by NAMI. This new engine had a modern overhead camshaft design but was never used in Fiat cars. The suspension was raised to clear rough Russian roads and the bodyshell was made from thicker, heavier steel with reinforcement in key chassis areas after cracking was discovered during durability testing. The first Lada models were equipped with a starting handle in case the battery went flat in Siberian conditions, though this was later dropped. Another feature specifically intended to help out in cold conditions was a manual auxiliary fuel pump.
Some of the improvements developed by VAZ engineers were quietly applied by Fiat to the 124 in its final years of production - for example the chassis strengthening; internally within Fiat these updated models are denoted "124R", the "R" standing for 'Russian'.
Engines fitted to the original Lada 2101 start with the 1.2l. The drivetrain is a simple rear-wheel drive setup with a live rear axle. The engine is an inline four with two valves per cylinder and a single overhead camshaft.
History.
The 2101 is a re-engineered version of the Fiat 124 produced under licence from Fiat and tailored for the nations of the Eastern Bloc, but was widely exported to the West as an economy car. Although the facelifted and modernised VAZ-2105, 2104 &amp; 2107 versions largely replaced it in the West in the early 1980s, it was still produced for the domestic market as late as 1988. Known as the "Zhiguli" (for the hills found near the plant) within the Soviet Union, the main differences between the VAZ-2101 and the Fiat 124 are the use of thicker gauge steel for the bodyshell, drum brakes on the rear wheels in place of disc brakes, and a bespoke engine. Early versions of the car featured a starting handle for cranking the engine manually should the battery go flat in Siberian winter conditions, and an auxiliary fuel pump.
Under the licensing agreement with Fiat, VAZ were forbidden from selling the car in Italy in order to protect Fiat's lucrative home market, nor was it permitted to sell it in any export market in competition with the 124; however, exports to Western Europe began in 1974 when the 124 was discontinued in favour of Fiat's newer 131 Mirafiori. The 2101 was exported under the Lada 1200, Lada 1300, Lada 1200S and Lada 2101 until 1989 and was positioned as a budget "no frills" offering; it was sold in the United Kingdom from May 1974, until the arrival of the Riva in 1983. It was the first Lada to be sold in the United Kingdom.
The first year, 22,000 were produced, and capacity reached 660,000 by 1973. Sales reached one million on 21 December 1973, and one and a half million in 1974. In May 1974, it went on sale in Britain, priced at £979.
The 2101 was built, virtually unaltered, from 1970 until 1982. The slightly upgraded 21013 continued to be built until 1988.
Models.
VAZ-2102.
The estate version of the VAZ-2101 (based on the Fiat 124 Familiare) was known as the 2102 and was available from 1971. It was replaced by the 2104 (Lada Riva in some markets) in 1985. Over 660,000 were built by end of production in 1986. In May 1974, it went on sale in Britain, priced at £979. 
VAZ-2103.
The 2103 (known in export markets as the Lada 1500) was very similar to the 2101, and had many common features with the Fiat 124 Special that was developed at the same time as the 2103, but with an external trim closer to the larger and more upmarket Fiat 125. It can be identified by four headlights, a squarer appearance to the front grille, and a different interior. Some markets also received the VAZ-2106, or Lada 1600.

VAZ-2103

The VAZ-2103 Zhiguli is a deluxe compact sedan car ("small class, passenger car, model 3" in the Soviet classification), produced by VAZ, introduced in 1972 and produced until 1984. Better known by its export name Lada 1500 outside of its native Soviet Union and popularly nicknamed the "Troika" () in its domestic market. The car was developed jointly by VAZ and FIAT at the same time as Fiat 124 Special, and the two models had the same basis and influenced each other. The 2103 was built under license and tailored to the Soviet and Eastern European markets. The 2103 externally differs from its predecessor, the VAZ-2101. Firstly, by its four, that is, double sets of headlights, different grille and direction pointers, moldings on the sides of the body and larger taillights. Its main difference - the more powerful straight-four petrol engine. In addition, this model is distinguished by the presence of a vacuum brake booster as well as self-adjusting rear brakes and internally on the new Fiat 125 based front panel. The interior was also more upmarket with a different steering wheel, cloth interior trim on export versions (in place of the VAZ-2101's vinyl) and an improved dashboard featuring wood imitation, tachometer, oil pressure gauge and front panel clock.
History.
Known as the Zhiguli within the Soviet Union, the main differences between the VAZ-2103 and the Fiat 124 Special are the use of thicker-gauge steel for the bodyshell (so the 2103 weighed , the Fiat less), an overhead camshaft engine (in place of the original Fiat OHV unit), and the use of aluminium drum brakes on the rear wheels in place of disc brakes. The car featured a starting handle for cranking the engine manually should the battery go flat in Siberian winter conditions, an auxiliary fuel pump and improved soundproofing. It was later joined by the -powered 21035 and the (VAZ 21011-engined) 21033.
VAZ was forbidden from selling the car in competing markets alongside the Fiat 124; however, exports to Western European nations began in 1974 when the 124 was discontinued in favour of Fiat's newer 131 Mirafiori model. The VAZ-2103 was sold in export markets from the mid-1970s to early 1980 essentially as a "de luxe" version of the VAZ-2101. In the United Kingdom, it was sold from May 1976 until May 1979 and it was the second Lada car to be sold in this market. Although starting to be slowly replaced with its successor, the VAZ-2106 already from 1976, it remained in production until 1984. It was the first VAZ model to be discontinued, despite not being the oldest one. This was mainly due to the complexity of production and the expense of its chrome plated elements, both of which were severely reduced in VAZ-2106.
Reviewers from the French L'Auto-Journal called it "an extremely serious working instrument, able to operate in the worst conditions" and "a well-made car capable of being serviced anywhere, even by its owner".
Changes and models.
The estate version VAZ-2102 was also available equipped with engine VAZ-2103 (1.5 L) and panel also known as Lada 1500 Combi (VAZ-21023, 1500 DL Estate).

Invariant differential operator

In mathematics and theoretical physics, an invariant differential operator is a kind of mathematical map from some objects to an object of similar type. These objects are typically functions on formula_1, functions on a manifold, vector valued functions, vector fields, or, more generally, sections of a vector bundle.
In an invariant differential operator formula_2, the term "differential operator" indicates that the value formula_3 of the map depends only on formula_4 and the derivatives of formula_5 in formula_6. The word "invariant" indicates that the operator contains some symmetry. This means that there is a group formula_7 with a group action on the functions (or other objects in question) and this action is preserved by the operator:
Usually, the action of the group has the meaning of a change of coordinates (change of observer) and the invariance means that the operator has the same expression in all admissible coordinates.
Invariance on homogeneous spaces.
Let "M" = "G"/"H" be a homogeneous space for a Lie group G and a Lie subgroup H. Every representation formula_9 gives rise to a vector bundle
Sections formula_11 can be identified with
In this form the group "G" acts on sections via
Now let "V" and "W" be two vector bundles over "M". Then a differential operator
that maps sections of "V" to sections of "W" is called invariant if
for all sections formula_16 in formula_17 and elements "g" in "G". All linear invariant differential operators on homogeneous parabolic geometries, i.e. when "G" is semi-simple and "H" is a parabolic subgroup, are given dually by homomorphisms of generalized Verma modules.
Invariance in terms of abstract indices.
Given two connections formula_18 and formula_19 and a one form formula_20, we have
for some tensor formula_22. Given an equivalence class of connections formula_23, we say that an operator is invariant if the form of the operator does not change when we change from one connection in the equivalence class to another. For example, if we consider the equivalence class of all torsion free connections, then the tensor Q is symmetric in its lower indices, i.e. formula_24. Therefore we can compute
where brackets denote skew symmetrization. This shows the invariance of the exterior derivative when acting on one forms.
Equivalence classes of connections arise naturally in differential geometry, for example:
Conformal invariance.
Given a metric 
on formula_31, we can write the sphere formula_32 as the space of generators of the nil cone
In this way, the flat model of conformal geometry is the sphere formula_34 with formula_35 and P the stabilizer of a point in formula_31. A classification of all linear conformally invariant differential operators on the sphere is known (Eastwood and Rice, 1987).

Hurricane Bob (1985)

Hurricane Bob was the first of six hurricanes to strike the United States during the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season. The second tropical storm and first hurricane of the year, Bob developed from a tropical wave on July 21 in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Bob began moving east, making landfall southwestern Florida as a weak tropical storm. The storm then turned to the north and quickly intensified to hurricane status on July 24. The next day, it made landfall near Beaufort, South Carolina, becoming one of a record-tying six hurricanes to hit the United States during a single season. Bob quickly weakened over land, and was absorbed by a frontal trough over eastern West Virginia on July 26.
Bob caused $20 million in damage as well as five indirect deaths. In Florida, the storm produced heavy rainfall, peaking at over in Everglades City. In most areas, the rainfall was beneficial due to dry conditions that had persisted throughout the year. Damage was minimal in South Carolina, where the hurricane made its final landfall. In Virginia, the storm spawned three tornadoes, one of which destroyed two houses.
Meteorological history.
The remnants of a tropical wave entered the eastern Gulf of Mexico on July 20. An area of low pressure formed and developed into a tropical depression on July 21. Under weak steering currents, the tropical depression drifted southeast, then turned northeast and later east. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Bob late on July 22. Bob failed to organize significantly as it tracked east through the Gulf, and made landfall between Naples and Fort Myers, Florida, on July 23 as a tropical storm. At the time, most of the convection was concentrated south and east of the center.
While moving across Florida, Bob turned to the northeast, then to the north. It subsequently left the peninsula, entering the Atlantic Ocean near Vero Beach early on July 24. As it moved over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, it quickly organized and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane while east of Jacksonville, Florida. Because it was embedded within the western extension of the subtropical ridge, Bob retained higher-than-average atmospheric pressures throughout its lifespan. The hurricane continued north, and made landfall near Beaufort, South Carolina, early on July 25 while maintaining winds of . Bob quickly weakened over land, decaying into a tropical storm three hours after landfall. About 12 hours later, it degenerated into a tropical depression near the North Carolina – Virginia border. Bob's remnants turned north-northeast, and were absorbed by a frontal trough over eastern West Virginia on July 26. An associated area of disturbed weather remained separate from the trough, and continued northeast through the Mid-Atlantic and New England.
Preparations.
When Bob was designated a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center issued gale warnings for the Florida Keys west of Craig Key, and from Flamingo to Venice. Gale warnings were later posted for the Atlantic coast of Florida northward through St. Augustine. Small craft south of St. Augustine were advised to remain in port. While the storm was situated off the east-central coast of Florida, the National Hurricane Center issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch from Savannah, Georgia, to Little River, South Carolina. The hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning after Bob's intensification to Category 1 status.
Thousands of residents evacuated coastal areas of South Carolina, many of whom stayed at inland hotels; 850 people sought protection in shelters, including 500 at an elementary school in Horry County and 240 in a shelter in the Grand Strand. In Beaufort County, city and county offices were closed early and businesses were advised to send their workers home prematurely. Officials in Chatham County, Georgia, evacuated nursing homes on Tybee Island, and encouraged others to leave due to the potential for high tides to isolate the island by cutting off U.S. Route 80.
Impact.
Hurricane Bob inflicted $20 million in damages and caused five indirect deaths. Damage from the storm was not severe enough to justify retirement of the name "Bob", and as such it was re-used during the 1991 season.
Florida.
In southern Florida, the heaviest rainfall remained to the south and east of the storm's center; of precipitation was recorded in Everglades City. Northern parts of the state reported trace amounts to several inches of precipitation. At Naples, sustained winds reached , with a peak gust of . Rough surf and above-average tides caused moderate to severe beach erosion in portions of coastal Manatee, Sarasota, and Charlotte counties. Before landfall, Tropical Storm Bob spawned an F0 tornado in Brevard County that caused $2,500 in damage (1985 USD, $4,700 2006 USD) along its path.
Tropical Storm Bob flooded roads and downed trees in Florida. Rough seas broke over sea walls in southwestern parts of the state, and the combination of high tides and heavy rain caused forced the closure of causeways to Sanibel Island and Marco Island, leaving the islands temporarily isolated. They were re-opened when the waters receded, though the causeway to Sanibel Island sustained some damage. Florida Power &amp; Light Co. reported that 1,200 to 1,500 residences were without power on July 23. In Palm Beach County, rainfall from the storm caused agricultural damage.
Overall damage was minimal and primarily confined to minor property near the coast. The storm's rainfall was beneficial in areas that had suffered dry conditions. In northeastern Florida and Georgia, beach erosion occurred along the coast. Bob was one of four July tropical cyclones to affect Palm Beach County since 1878.
Carolinas.
The strongest winds from Hurricane Bob were confined to areas east of its center when it came ashore around 1 am Eastern Standard Time (EST). Along the barrier islands off the coast of Charleston, windows were broken and power lines knocked down. Further inland, the lack of damage in spite of high winds was described as "almost unbelievable". Georgetown, South Carolina, northeast of where the storm made landfall, recorded sustained winds of , and a spiral rainband produced a peak wind gust of in Holden Beach. Upon moving ashore, the hurricane produced an estimated storm tide of in Edisto Beach. Rainfall in the Carolinas was moderate; portions of coastal South Carolina received over of precipitation. Myrtle Beach reported a statewide peak of . Hurricane-force wind gusts downed trees and power lines, leaving over 32,000 people without power, including more than 25,000 in the Charleston area. Near the coast, high winds shattered windows.
Strong waves broke over sea walls in Charleston, spilling floodwaters onto coastal streets and homes. Damage in the state was relatively light, and no serious injuries were reported. However, a gas station in Folly Beach was torn apart by the winds, and some structures along the coast sustained roof damage. In the Charleston Harbor, an empty tanker was forced aground on a sandbar by the winds. Throughout most areas, the storm was insignificant; a police sergeant in Summerville commented, "All we've had were some trees blown over, hardly enough to make it worth staying up so late."
Much of North Carolina received over of rain; as much as fell in Beaufort County. The storm caused one traffic-related fatality in the state.
Mid-Atlantic and New England.
In Virginia, a large band of thunderstorms associated with the hurricane brought strong winds and spawned three tornadoes. A funnel cloud formed in Albemarle County evolved into an F3 tornado after crossing into Greene County. It destroyed two houses and uprooted several trees, inflicting $250,000 in damage (1985 USD, $470,000 2006 USD). F0 tornadoes were also generated in Goochland County and Hanover County; the two tornadoes damaged a total of ten houses. Funnel clouds were sighted throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area.
Heavy precipitation and high winds disrupted the 1985 Boy Scouts of America National Scout Jamboree at Fort A. P. Hill near Fredericksburg, Virginia, knocking over hundreds of tents and fifty portable toilets. One scout was struck by a falling gateway and several others sustained minor cuts and bruises. The storm produced winds of at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and about 30,000 people near Washington, D.C., and 125,000 in Baltimore were left without power. Moderate winds downed a sea plane near Hains Point in the Washington Channel. Rough seas capsized a few boats along the Potomac River, and rainfall from Bob's remnants forced the cancellation of a Richmond Braves game. and collapsed a house under construction in Great Falls, Maryland. A dam in Northeastern Virginia sustained storm-related damage. Slick roads led to several traffic accidents; one person in Washington, D.C., and three in Maryland were killed. High winds in the Washington, D.C., area also flipped over a pontoon-equipped Cessna 210 airplane near Hains Point, holding a five-man television crew. The crew, who worked for the television series Lime Street had been preparing to film a chase scene for the television drama. All five escaped the plane safely with the aid of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia harbor patrol.
Rainfall in the Mid-Atlantic and New England states was around , with isolated reports of over . About of precipitation fell in Atlantic City, New Jersey, within a period of 10 minutes. In Maryland, the rainfall helped to relieve persistent dry conditions.

Notre-Dame-du-Cap Basilica

The Basilica of Notre-Dame-du-Cap is a minor basilica in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada. It is Canada's national shrine to the Blessed Virgin Mary, and one of the country's six national shrines. Each year, the site is visited by thousands of Catholic pilgrims.
History.
The first church in the district of Cap-de-la-Madeleine was a small wooden structure built in 1659. In 1694, the first resident pastor, Father Paul Vachon, established the Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary at Cap de la Madeleine. The wooden building was replaced by a fieldstone church in 1720. The hand hewn beams from the wooden church were used in the construction of the new stone church. Canon Vachon died in 1729 and is buried in the church.
For a long time the parish was without a resident pastor and fell into neglect. In 1867, Father Luc Desilets, pastor at Cap-de-la-Madeleine, re-introduced the praying of the rosary and promoted it among his parishioners. A more regular pastoral presence resulted in increased attendance, and a larger church was needed.
Initially, construction of a new church was hampered by the difficulty of transporting material. However, in mid-March 1879, despite it being an unusually mild winter, a small section of the St. Lawrence River froze sufficiently that, by adding additional snow and water, Father Louis-Eugene Duguay, and some parishioners were able to construct a narrow mile-and-a-half long ice bridge. The ice held for a full week and allowed the building material to be hauled across on horse-drawn sledges. The people attributed their success to the intercession of the Blessed Mother. In October 1880 the finished third church was dedicated to Sainte-Marie-Madeleine.
True to a promise made to the Blessed Virgin, instead of demolishing the old stone church, Desilets dedicated it to Our Lady, Queen of the Most Holy Rosary. The first pilgrimage to the Sanctuary was made on May 7, 1883. Desilets died shortly thereafter, and Duguay became pastor. Janssoone took over the responsibility of managing the shrine, and installed a Way of the Cross. Bronze statues depicted the stations. As the parish work and number of pilgrims increased, they asked the bishop to appoint a custodian to take over the shrine. In 1902, the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate became guardians of the Shrine. Beginning in 1906, they installed a Way of the Rosary. The path leads to a series of bronze statues, cast in France, each representing one of the fifteen traditional mysteries of the rosary.
In October 1904, Pope Pius X authorized the canonical coronation of Our Lady of the Cape. In 1964, the present basilica was inaugurated, and the sanctuary officially became a minor basilica. The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate continue to operate the shrine.
Pope John Paul II visited in September 1984.
Father Janssoone was declared blessed by Pope John Paul II on September 25, 1988.
Architecture.
The church that was completed in 1888, was demolished in 1963 to make way for the square in front of the present basilica. Some of its stones were kept to make an addition to the first church in 1973. The basilica, designed by architect Adrien Dufresne, opened in 1964 and can accommodate up to 1,660 people. Reinforced concrete arches outline the building.
The Casavant organ consists of 5,425 pipes. The stained glass windows are by Dutch Oblate Father Jan Tillemans.

He attended Etobicoke School of the Arts for Visual Arts and received a BFA from Concordia University in 2001.
Career.
While with the Deadly Snakes, Ethier released his debut solo album "André Ethier with Christopher Sandes featuring Pickles and Price" in 2004. This was later cited by his bandmate Max "Age of Danger" McCabe-Lokos as having fomented creative tensions during the recording of the band's Polaris Music Prize-nominated 2005 album "Porcella", and ultimately to the band's breakup.
Ethier's second solo album, "Secondathallam", was released in 2006.
His song "Self-Love" was featured on the soundtrack to the 2007 film "This Beautiful City". On June 10, 2007, Ethier sang "O Canada" in Los Angeles, where the Los Angeles Dodgers were hosting his hometown Toronto Blue Jays. He got the gig because he shares his name with Dodgers outfielder Andre Ethier.
Ethier followed up with the album "On Blue Fog" in 2007, and the sequel album "Born of Blue Fog" in 2008.
In 2011 he contributed to the National Parks Project, visiting Prince Albert National Park with Mathieu Charbonneau, Rebecca Foon and filmmaker Stéphane Lafleur to shoot and score a short documentary film about the park.
He concentrated primarily on art through the early 2010s, and did not release an album of new material until 2017's "Under Grape Leaves". He followed up in 2019 with "Croak in the Weeds", and in 2021 with "Further Up Island".
Art.
Ethier paints portraits, figures and landscapes in oil, his work has been described as a grotesque realism and is influenced by neo-expressionism, primitive art, underground comic art and the works of Giuseppe Arcimboldo and Odilon Redon. He has had solo shows at Honor Fraser Gallery in Los Angeles, Greener Pastures Contemporary Art in Toronto, and Derek Eller Gallery in New York. He is represented by Derek Eller Gallery.
In "The New York Times" Ken Johnson wrote: "André Ethier's funny, faux-naïve paintings resemble the works of a self-taught, semi-talented high school stoner steeped in heavy-metal music, fantasy novels and the visionary arts of the French Symbolists."

Edward J. Lewis

Edward J. "Eddie" Lewis (May 30, 1937 – November 30, 2006) was an American businessman, investor, and philanthropist.
Early life and education.
Lewis was born in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, the son of Eugene Lebowitz, a Hungarian Jewish immigrant who lost family members to the Holocaust. After graduating from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Pennsylvania Law School on a full scholarship, he embarked upon a brief law career in Philadelphia before moving back to his native Pittsburgh. On the advice of his father, Lewis changed his name from Lebowitz to Lewis to avoid antisemitism.
Career.
In the mid-1960s, Lewis joined the Don Mark Realty, a partnership founded by his father; his brother-in-law, Mark Mason; Harold “Harry” Soffer; and Soffer's son; Donald Soffer. Lewis quickly assumed leadership of the family firm, which would later be renamed Oxford Development Company. In 1965, at age 28, Lewis and his partners embarked on an ambitious project to develop South Hills Village, Pittsburgh’s first indoor mall and one of the first two-story enclosed shopping malls in the United States.
In 1967, with funding from the John Hancock Life Insurance Company, Oxford Development partnered with the Arlen Realty and Development Corporation to form the DonArl Partnership and bought 785 acres of mostly swampland in South Florida for $6 million. Originally named Turnberry, they renamed the site Aventura from the Spanish word for "adventure" after Lewis reportedly remarked "What an adventure this is going to be." Lewis and his partners set about to build an upper class development centered around the Aventura Country Club with a golf course designed by architect Robert Trent Jones. The project required that they drain the swamps (to the ire of environmental activists) and re-zone the property from residential single family to high-rise development (to the ire of controlled-growth advocates). With the support of then governor, Claude Kirk, the development went ahead. In 1969, Metro-Dade County approved the 23,900 condo unit master plan which included the construction of a fire station, a library, and a causeway to Sunny Isles Beach. They completed the first stage in 1970 and by 1977 had completed the golf course and added another 4,000 units. The venture was very profitable as they purchased land at $5,000 and acre and sold plots for as high as $2 million an acre in 1981.
In 1977, the partnership with Arlen Realty was dissolved over disputes about the quality of construction and the partners divided the properties. In 1983, Arlen Realty defaulted on a $39 million mortgage and went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Lewis and his partners purchased the remaining 68 acres of undeveloped land and built the Aventura Mall, among other high-profile projects in South Florida. Soon after, Lewis sold his interest to Donald Soffer who formed Turnberry Associates while Lewis kept the Oxford Development Company name. Lewis' firm quickly flourished into the multi-faceted real estate development corporation that is Oxford Development Company.
Among his business accomplishments, Eddie Lewis is credited for developing the first two-story enclosed shopping mall in the United States, South Hills Village in suburban Pittsburgh, and virtually conceptualizing the modern American regional shopping mall thereafter. Additionally, Lewis was instrumental in developing much of what has become Aventura, FL, a city which he named, in South Florida, with developments including Aventura Mall, Turnberry Isle Resort and Club, and numerous high-end residential projects. Lewis' achievements in commercial real estate span numerous states and range from spiraling urban skyscrapers to suburban retail centers. Monroeville Mall in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area and the One Oxford Centre skyscraper in downtown Pittsburgh were also projects led by Lewis and his Oxford Development. Both Lewis and Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. were partners in the One Oxford Centre skyscraper project and made an offer to purchase the Pittsburgh Pirates major league baseball team in 1981.
Lewis was the chairman of the board of his family-owned company, which continues to be a prominent player in commercial and residential real estate.
Personal life and death.
Lewis died on November 30, 2006, from complications related to lung cancer. The family-owned company has been passed on to his wife, Anne, his four children, his sister Myrna and his brother-in-law Mark Mason. Longtime executive Steven J. Guy currently leads the company's day-to-day operations. Services were held at Rodef Shalom Congregation in Shadyside, Pittsburgh. Lewis was a generous donor to countless philanthropic causes, supporting the United Jewish Federation, the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the ALS Association.
Lewis belonged to the older generation of Pittsburgh real estate developers – such as Joseph Soffer, Jack Buncher, Stanley Gumberg, and Leonard Rudolph – who conducted business with a handshake. Despite keeping a low profile with the press, Lewis' famed yacht "Monkey Business" became an internationally known household name after a visit by Presidential-hopeful Gary Hart sunk his political campaign.

Value shop

A value shop is an organization designed to solve customer or client problems, rather than creating value by producing output from an input of raw materials. The principles of value shops were first conceptualized by Thompson in 1967, and properly defined by Charles B. Stabell and Øystein D. Fjeldstad of the Norwegian School of Management in 1998, who also created the name. 
Compared to Michael Porter's concept of the value chain, there is no sequential fixed set of activities or resources utilized to create value. Each problem is treated uniquely and activities and resources are allocated specifically to cater to the problem in question.
According to the research of Stabell and Fjeldstad, the value configuration analysis (1998), five main generic activities are carried out in the organization:
Value is created in the shop by several mechanisms allowing the organization to solve problems better or faster than the client. These are variables such as:
Some of the classical examples of value shops include management consultancies such as Boston Consulting Group, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and McKinsey. The value shop concept has also been applied to a number of other activities including Norwegian police investigations (e.g. Gottschalk, 2007) and the knowledge-intensive energy exploration business (Woiceshyn and Falkenberg, 2008).

Chinese Martyrs

Chinese Martyrs () is the name given to a number of members of the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church who were killed in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. They are venerated as martyrs. Most were Chinese laypersons, but others were clergy from various other countries; many of them died during the Boxer Rebellion.
Eastern Orthodox.
The Eastern Orthodox Church recognizes 222 Orthodox Christians who died during the Boxer Rebellion as Holy Martyrs of China. On the evening of 11 June 1900 leaflets were posted in the streets, calling for the massacre of the Christians and threatening anyone who would dare to shelter them with death.
They were mostly members of the Chinese Orthodox Church, which had been under the guidance of the Russian Orthodox Church since the 17th century and maintained close relations with them, especially in the large Russian community in Harbin. They are called new-martyrs, as they died under a modern regime. The first of these martyrs was Metrophanes, Chi Sung, leader of the Peking Mission, who was killed, along with his family, during the Boxer Rebellion. All told, 222 members of the Peking mission died.
In April 22, 1902 the Russian Orthodox Church allowed the local veneration of the Chinese Martyrs. In 1997, ROCOR promoted the church-wide veneration of the martyrs and several icons were made, in 2016, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church officially canonized the saints and allowed church-wide veneration.
Roman Catholic.
The Roman Catholic Church recognizes 120 Catholics who died between 1648 and 1930 as its Martyr Saints of China. They were canonized by Pope John Paul II on 1 October 2000. Of the group, 87 were Chinese laypeople and 33 were clergy; 86 died during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. The Chinese Martyrs Catholic Church in Toronto, Ontario is named for them.
Protestant.
Many Protestants also died during the Boxer Rebellion, including the China Martyrs of 1900, but there is no formal veneration (according to their religious beliefs) nor a universally recognized list.
At least 189 missionaries and 500 native Chinese Protestant Christians were murdered in 1900 alone. Though some missionaries considered themselves non-denominationally Protestant, among those killed were Baptists, Evangelicals, Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians and Plymouth Brethren.

John J. Tigert

John James Tigert IV (February 11, 1882 – January 21, 1965) was an American university president, university professor and administrator, college sports coach and the U.S. Commissioner of Education. Tigert was a native of Tennessee and the son and grandson of Methodist bishops. After receiving his bachelor's degree, he earned his master's degree as a Rhodes Scholar.
After completing his education, Tigert taught at Central College; served as the president of Kentucky Wesleyan College; and worked as a professor, sports coach and administrator at the University of Kentucky.
Tigert gained his greatest national prominence as the U.S. Commissioner of Education from 1921 to 1928, and the third president of the University of Florida, from 1928 to 1947. He is remembered as a forceful advocate for American public education, intercollegiate sports and university curriculum reform.
Early life and education.
Tigert was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1882, the third son of a Methodist Episcopal minister, John James Tigert III, and his wife, Amelia McTyeire Tigert, the daughter of Methodist Bishop and Vanderbilt University co-founder Holland N. McTyeire. Tigert received his primary education in the public schools of Kansas City, Missouri, and Nashville, and earned his high school diploma, with honors, from the Webb School in Bell Buckle, Tennessee.
Vanderbilt.
He was admitted to Vanderbilt University in Nashville, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity (Tennessee Alpha Chapter) and a standout athlete in baseball, basketball, football and track. His time at Vanderbilt overlaps with Grantland Rice. As a senior, Tigert was honored as an All-Southern halfback for the Vanderbilt Commodores football team. In his final game, he scored the first points netted all season against rival Sewanee.
Tigert graduated from Vanderbilt with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1904; he was selected for Phi Beta Kappa, and was chosen as a Rhodes Scholar, the first from the state of Tennessee, along with teammate Bob Blake. While at Oxford University in Oxford, England, he completed his Master of Arts degree at Pembroke College in 1907, and he continued to participate in competitive university sports, including cricket, rowing and tennis.
Educator, administrator, reformer.
After returning to the United States, Tigert taught at the Methodist-affiliated Central College—now known as Central Methodist University—in Fayette, Missouri, and, at the age of 27, was appointed president of Kentucky Wesleyan College in Owensboro, Kentucky in 1909. That same year, he married the former Edith Jackson Bristol.
University of Kentucky.
Tigert later received an appointment as a professor of psychology and philosophy at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky, where he did work on psychology in advertising. While there, Tigert also served as the athletic director from 1913 to 1917, the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball coach in 1913, 1916 and 1917, the Wildcats women's basketball coach from 1911 to 1915 and again from 1916 to 1917, and the Wildcats football coach in 1915 and 1916.
Commissioner of Education.
President Warren G. Harding appointed Tigert as the U.S. Commissioner of Education in 1921, and he served for seven years during the administrations of Harding and Calvin Coolidge. As commissioner, he was an energetic advocate of education reform and greater educational opportunities for all classes of Americans, and he traveled widely and spoke often to virtually any group interested in education. In particular, he took an interest in rural education, and advocated innovative ways to impart public education to a wider audience, including the use of radio. During his time in Washington, D.C., he also served a term as the national president of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity.
University of Florida.
The Florida Board of Control selected Tigert as the third president of the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida in 1928. He assumed leadership of the university during an extended period of economic crisis in the state of Florida. When the Great Depression began with the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Florida was already suffering from the after-effects of the 1920s land boom and bust, as well the devastating aftermath of two major hurricanes in 1926 and 1928.
The common thread of the nineteen years of Tigert's administration was doing more with less. Faculty salary cuts were common; Tigert himself never drew his full authorized annual salary of $10,000. Among Tigert's many significant reforms, he decentralized the university budget to the level of the individual academic colleges, allowing them to set their own spending priorities. The University Council, composed of the president, the registrar and the college deans, retained final approval authority. Tigert also established the faculty senate, the Institute of Inter-American Affairs and the Bureau of Economic and Business Research.
One of his most influential reforms as president was the founding of the new University College as an academic division within the University of Florida in 1935. The college was modeled on the general education college at the University of Chicago, and administered the freshman and sophomore-year liberal arts education of undergraduates before they were accepted to the university schools or colleges that administered their academic majors. The college's stated purpose was to "stimulate intellectual curiosity" and "encourage independent work", with new liberal arts requirements in biology, English language and literature, the humanities, logic, mathematics, physical sciences and social sciences, and thereby counter the growing trend toward "trade school" education at the university level.
As a former university athlete and coach, Tigert took a particular interest in athletics-related policy issues while he was president and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Florida Gators sports program generally, and football in particular. He was responsible for the construction of the university's first and only permanent football stadium, Florida Field, in 1930. He borrowed $10,000 to begin construction of the stadium, and then raised $118,000 to pay the construction costs of the 22,800-seat facility. Tigert also hired Blake R. Van Leer as Dean to expand the engineering program and manage all applications for federal funding. Van Leer also chaired the advanced planning committee setup by Tigert. Tigert was also instrumental in the organization of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), which the University of Florida joined as one of the thirteen founding institutions in December 1932. Tigert subsequently served two terms as SEC president (1934–1936 and 1945–1947). As a key leader within the SEC, he worked to impose a uniform set of rules and standards for academic eligibility for SEC athletes. Appalled by the under-the-table payments to amateur college athletes that were prevalent at the time, he advocated the grant of scholarships to athletes which would become the grant-in-aid of other university athletic programs and as mandated by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the years to follow.
Like his predecessor, Albert A. Murphree, Tigert was elected president of the National Association of State Universities, serving from 1939 to 1940.
Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, students began to withdraw from the university in large numbers to enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. The financial impact on the university had the potential to be devastating, but Tigert navigated the war years by making the university campus, dormitories and class rooms available for the training of U.S. Army Air Force flight crews. Veterans began to return to school with support from the GI Bill, and by the fall term of 1946, over seventy percent of the University of Florida's 7,000 students were returning World War II veterans. Contributing to the shortage of facility space was the influx of new female students when the Florida Legislature reinstituted co-education in 1947. The university suddenly had more students than its available housing and classroom space could serve.
Tigert resigned as university president in 1947, worked as an educational consultant to the government of India as a member of its University Education Commission, and taught philosophy at the University of Miami until 1959.
Legacy.
Tigert served as president of the University of Florida for nineteen years, longer than any of the other presidents of the university. During his term, the university awarded its first doctoral degrees in 1934, a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was installed in 1938, and total student enrollment grew from 2,162 in 1928 to over 7,500 in 1947. As university president, he was responsible for significant and lasting academic, athletic and administrative reforms.
In recognition of Tigert's long service as its president through depression and war, the University of Florida awarded him an honorary degree, a doctor of letters, during its 1953 centennial celebration, and renamed its main administrative building, Tigert Hall, for him in 1960. Tigert died in Gainesville, Florida on January 21, 1965; he was 82 years old. He was survived by his wife Edith, their son and daughter, and five grandchildren.
As a fitting final tribute to a professor, education reformer and administrator, who also fervently supported college sports, Tigert was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as an "Honorary Letter Winner," and was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1970.

William Garnett (photographer)

William A. Garnett (December 27, 1916 – August 26, 2006) was an American landscape photographer who specialized in aerial photography.
Early life.
Garnett was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1916, and in 1920 his family moved to Pasadena, California. After graduating from Pasadena's John Muir Technical High School he studied for one year at the Art Center School in Los Angeles and then, beginning in 1938, he worked for two years as an independent commercial photographer and graphic designer.
Career.
In 1940 he was hired as a photographer by the Pasadena Police Department, where he was employed for four years. In 1944 he worked briefly for the Lockheed aircraft company before being drafted into the U.S. Army, where he assisted in the production of training films for the U.S. Signal Corps.
After leaving the Army in 1945 Garnett used the G.I. Bill to pay for flight instruction and by 1949 he had purchased his first plane and begun capturing the aerial photographs for which he is admired. His work began to attract critical attention and in 1953 he won the first of three Guggenheim fellowships for his beautiful landscapes.
In 1955, Garnett had his first one-man show at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. His work was also included in Edward Steichen's "The Family of Man" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1955.
Garnett bought a Cessna 170B in 1956 and he used it for decades as a vantage point for his photography. He made small modifications to the plane to facilitate his photography. According to the Getty Museum, Garnett "experimented with a variety of camera formats and films but found that two 35mm cameras (one loaded with black-and-white film, and another with color film) best suited his needs." He may have also used Pentax 6X7 medium format cameras to capture his imagery.
In 1958 Garnett moved from Los Angeles to Napa, California, and continued working as a commercial photographer for the next ten years. In 1968 he joined the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley. He served as a professor at the university until his retirement in 1984.
Garnett's photography was featured in many national magazines, including "Fortune", "Life", "Reader's Digest", and "The New York Times Magazine". His unique landscapes have also appeared in many art books and as illustrations in many textbooks.
His work has been collected by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
Personal life.
In 1941 Garnett married contralto Eula Beal (1919–2008) and together they raised three sons.
Garnett died on August 26, 2006, at his home in Napa, California.

Abdominal epilepsy

Abdominal epilepsy is a rare condition consisting of gastrointestinal disturbances caused by epileptiform seizure activity. It is most frequently found in children, though a few cases of it have been reported in adults. It has been described as a type of temporal lobe epilepsy. Responsiveness to anticonvulsants can aid in the diagnosis. Distinguishing features of abdominal epilepsy include:
Most published medical literature dealing with abdominal epilepsy is in the form of individual case reports. A 2005 review article found a total of 36 cases described in the medical literature.
Symptoms and signs.
Abdominal epilepsy is marked by GI symptoms such as abdominal pain followed by uncontrollable vomiting, usually preceded by lethargy. Lethargy and confusion are the most common neurological symptoms associated with abdominal epilepsy. Other symptoms include generalized tonic-clonic seizures followed by sleep, and unresponsiveness. Abdominal aura characterized by abdominal sensations precedes the abdominal seizure. This is associated with pain, nausea, hunger, gassiness, especially in temporal lobe epilepsy.
Cause.
It is unknown as to what causes abdominal epilepsy. While a causal relationship between seizure activity and the GI symptoms has not been proven, the GI symptoms cannot be explained by other pathophysiological mechanisms, and are seen to improve upon anticonvulsant treatment. Because the condition is so rare, no high-quality studies exist. There have been too few reported cases to identify risk factors, genetic factors, or other potential causes.
Diagnosis.
Criteria for diagnosis of abdominal epilepsy includes frequent periodic abdominal symptoms, an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) and significant improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms after taking anti-seizure medication. Medical testing for diagnosis can be completed using MRI scans of the brain, CT scans and ultrasounds of the abdomen, endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract, and blood tests.
Typically, the diagnostic process begins with gathering information regarding the presence of common symptoms like paroxysmal abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal issues. Symptoms that persist continuously or for prolonged periods are less likely to indicate abdominal epilepsy. It's important to consider convulsions, alterations in consciousness, and other neurological symptoms alongside gastrointestinal symptoms when diagnosing abdominal epilepsy. Though, every episode of it may not be accompanied by a neurological symptom. This often makes these neurological symptoms unnoticeable for the patient.
This is followed by the necessary evaluation that comprises neurological and physical examination, laboratory test, abdominal imaging using CT and ultrasound, endoscopy. Next if the above are normal but the history still suggests for this syndrome an EEG must be performed. EEG findings alone cannot distinguish between the kinds of epilepsy. Moreover, an EEG report could be normal if an event is not accompanied by neurological symptoms. If it is doubtable, a neurologist should be consulted.
Treatment.
Like other forms of epilepsy, abdominal epilepsy is treated with anticonvulsant drugs, such as phenytoin. Based on the clinical response additional medication may be used for complementing it or it could be used instead of phenytoin. Since no controlled studies exist, however, other drugs may be equally effective. Anticonvulsants target non-epileptic causes of abdominal pain via sedative mechanisms. It may also act just as a placebo. The prognosis is generally good and most patients are benefitted from medicines alone.
Pathophysiology.
The pathophysiology behind abdominal epilepsy remains speculative. Several studies indicate that insula and sylvian fissures also known as lateral sulcus could be related to inducing abdominal epilepsy. Their location is found to coincide with the locations of the abdomen on the Sensory homunculus. Any pathophysiological changes in the M2 portion of cerebral artery which flows through lateral sulcus are associated with the epilepsies of the temporal and parietal regions. The abdominal symptoms are believed to be associated with the transmission of impulses from the temporal lobe to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve via the dense direct projections. The hypothalamus is also believed to induce sympathetic pathways from the amygdala in the medial temporal lobe to the GI tract to trigger such symptoms.
Cerebral tumors have been assessed to be a plausible cause of abdominal epilepsy. Right parietal and occipital encephalomalacia, biparietal atrophy, and bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria has been possibly associated with ictal abdominal pain associated with abdominal epilepsy.
History.
French physician and scientist Armand Trousseau is commonly credited as being the first to describe the condition in 1868 in a boy with paroxysmal GI symptoms culminating in grand mal epileptic seizure. The first account of abdominal epilepsy supported by EEG tracings came in 1944 in an article by M.T. Moore, followed by subsequent case reports from the same group.

Paul Myers (music producer)

Paul Myers (born 1967 in Plaistow, London, England) is a British author and businessman and was formerly a record producer. He was the CEO and founder of pioneering online music store Wippit. Myers now heads application developer Bappz and independent podcast production company Playback Media.
Music industry.
During the 1980s, Myers was a club DJ, and was resident at the Hippodrome in London at the age of 18. From 1989 to 1995 he was a songwriter and record producer working for Polydor Records, Warner Brothers Recordings, Rhythm King Records, and Sony Music. He contributed to the movie soundtrack to "A Rage in Harlem". In 1991 he was awarded a platinum disc for his production work on the Betty Boo's album "Boomania" including the single "24 Hours" which was also written and co-vocaled by Myers. His songs have been remixed and produced by Fat Boy Slim, William Orbit, Vince Clarke and David Morales.
Internet businesses.
Among his early Internet ventures from 1994 were the web design agency Nethead and the search portal G.O.D.
In 1998 he launched a free Internet access company, The X-Stream Network, the first Free ISP in the UK. This company is now part of TalkTalk following the sale of X-Stream to French owned LibertySurf for $75m in 2000.
In 2000, he founded Wippit, a legal P2P music subscription service and created online music stores for Associated Newspapers, Express Newspapers and EasyGroup. Wippit was the biggest UK-based MP3 online music and movies store and in terms of sales became the second biggest digital media service, after the UK branch of the iTunes Music Store. 
From 15 March 2007 Wippit produced "The All Day Breakfast Show", a podcast by award-winning radio presenter Danny Baker described in The Guardian newspaper as the 'Future of Radio' as well as Sports related podcasts including The Spurs Show, Stop!

2005 New Zealand election funding controversy

The 2005 New Zealand election funding controversy occurred in the aftermath of the 2005 New Zealand general election.
Under New Zealand's political system, parties may only spend, during the 90 days before the election, up to a certain amount on campaigning (excluding broadcasting). They must raise that money from their own sources. Other funds are available through the Parliamentary Service to Members of Parliament for "parliamentary purposes", which may include advertising but not "electioneering material". Following the 2005 election, there was widespread debate as most parties had breached either election or parliamentary spending rules in some respect.
Election spending allegations.
Labour.
Labour and five other political parties were investigated for alleged breaches of election spending rules relating to the 2005 election. The Electoral Commission, the independent body charged with supervising compliance with campaign rules, referred the Labour Party to the police after finding that they had overspent by over $400,000. Labour's election campaign included the production, using Parliamentary Service funds, of a "pledge card". The party had wanted to exclude the $446,000 it spent on the pledge cards from its campaign expenses, but the Electoral Commission ruled the pledge cards should be included. The police found that "there was insufficient evidence to indicate that an offence under s214b of the Electoral Act had been committed." While police considered "there was sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case" of an offence under section 221 of the act (which requires a party secretary to authorise party advertising in writing), they decided not to lay a prosecution, preferring instead to warn Labour that similar future offences would risk prosecution, because it was not clear that the offence was intentional. They said a number of other parties had also used similar tactics and it would have been unfair to single Labour out.
National.
National was left owing a number of broadcasters $112,500 after spending its broadcasting allowance without accounting for GST. National argued that "due to a misunderstanding between the Party and its advertising booking agency, the agency booked advertising for National on radio and television for the campaign totalling $900,000 excluding GST, instead of $900,000 including GST". Police were not able to attribute responsibility for the mistaken GST over-expenditure to either the NZ National Party or to the Party's media buying agency and did not charge either.
Labour criticised the use by the National Party of trust funds to facilitate large anonymous donations, alleging American multi-millionaire Julian Robertson as a contributor. Robertson, a friend of National leader Don Brash, had connections to the Republican Party in the US. However, National Party campaign manager Steven Joyce stated, "It is possible that [Mr Robertson] made an anonymous donation. It is also possible that he may have given to one of the trusts that periodically makes donations to us but again I have no knowledge of that. They don't tell me who gives the money so I don't know." Spending outside of campaign funding limits is permitted up to three months before election date.
Labour also criticised Brash's use of the parliamentary leader's fund (also supplied through Parliamentary Services) to pay for his advisor, Bryan Sinclair, alleging he was an election strategist.
Auditor-General report.
The Auditor-General investigated publicly funded party advertising for the 2005 election, with a preliminary finding that much of the spending was unlawful being leaked. A final report was released on 12 October 2006. It found that $1.17 million had been improperly spent, as follows:
After a draft of the Auditor-General's report was leaked, the National Party repaid the amount that the report said was spent by it unlawfully. Labour strategist Pete Hodgson said on 13 September 2006 that his party would not be repaying any money, and the Government might introduce legislation to legalise the spending.
The Speaker of the House, who has responsibility for the Parliamentary Service, sought a legal opinion in response to the Auditor General's report. While she did not agree with the legal analysis of the Auditor General, the Speaker, Margaret Wilson, recommended that legislation be passed to retrospectively validate expenditure, that parties should pay back their overspending, not as a legal obligation, but in order to maintain the confidence of the public, that the administrative processes of Parliamentary Services should be reviewed, and that legislation be developed to clarify the law on expenditure.
The Labour Party announced immediately after the report was published that it would repay the money it owed. Helen Clark said "Labour strongly maintains that it spent its parliamentary budget within the rules as they were understood at the time, and in the same way as other parties have over a long period of time. Given the Auditor-General’s new ruling, however, Labour will refund the spending identified".
Minor parties.
The Progressive Party was the only party found by the Auditor General not to have misspent parliamentary funding. All the other parties except New Zealand First repaid their misspent funding.
The Māori Party stated in September 2006 that during the election campaign an anonymous donor offered them $250,000 on the condition that they backed a Labour-led government after the election. The offer was not accepted. Labour denied any knowledge of the offer, and both Labour and National suggested holding an inquiry into the offer. A spokesman for the Electoral Commission said the offer did not break any provisions of the Electoral Act, but Auckland University law professor Bill Hodge considered that it may fall within the Crimes Act definition of bribery and corruption.
Third party campaigning.
Shortly before the 2005 election, anti-Labour and anti-Greens pamphlets were distributed to a large number of New Zealand mailboxes. Unlike party advertising, the pamphlets' origins were not made explicit. In particular they criticised Green party policy, claiming that the Greens' policies were "reminiscent…of communists" and the Greens planned to "disarm our forces", terms which the Greens considered to be outright lies - inflammatory and misleading, as was much of the content of the pamphlet. Immediately after the election, the Greens stated that the "... pamphlet drop probably cost the party a seat", and perhaps enough to have governed alone with Labour.
The pamphlets were released with minimal information as to who had funded them, with only the names and PO Box addresses of individuals. Former members of the Exclusive Brethren Church recognised those names and informed the Green Party and the media of their links with the Brethren Church, which had been involved in a similar campaign in Australia. The National party and its leader Don Brash initially denied knowing about the pamphlets, but Brash later admitted that he had met with the Brethren three or four times during the campaign, where he was told "they planned to run some advertisements in the media, particularly around defence and health policies". Brash asserts that he and his staff advised the Brethren to check the legality of their advertising and that National had no control over its content. Brash also says that he did not recall their intention to issue anti-Green pamphlets. Brash and other National supporters noted that unions have funded third party advertising in support of Labour, and argued that the Brethren pamphlets were equivalent. Labour Party strategist Pete Hodgson responded that advertising paid for by unions was declared within Labour's budget and explicit about who had funded and approved it.
University of Otago electoral law expert Andrew Geddis' opinion was that National probably did not break the law, but that the party's actions "stank" and that the electoral system was like "panel beaters designing intersections".
In addition to the pamphlets, the Brethren assisted the National Party through help with man-power, rather than direct donations. The group had collected a "war-chest" of $1,200,000, though there is no evidence they spent anywhere near this much during the election campaign. The Exclusive Brethren Church members had originally intended to openly support National but modified the pamphlets to an invitation to "Change the Government" after consulting with the Chief Electoral Officer and being informed that otherwise this would count towards National's spending. The issue of Exclusive Brethren involvement led to Labour calls for compulsory disclosure of large donations to political parties within altered campaign finance legislation.
Activist Nicky Hager felt there were clear distinctions on the legal advertisings of the Unions and what he alleged as obvious violations of the election act section 221 by not only the Exclusive Brethren with full knowledge of members of the National party ("The Hollow Men: A Study in the Politics of Deception" p238), but also third party spending by several other groups including the Horse Racing Lobby. Hager adds rhetorically, "Why was this not picked up by Auditor-General Kevin Brady…?" ("The Hollow Men: A Study in the Politics of Deception" p240)
Darnton's lawsuit.
On 29 June 2006, Bernard Darnton, leader of the Libertarianz, sued Helen Clark for allegedly misappropriating public funds to pay for her "pledge cards" during the 2005 election. Some commentators labelled the lawsuit a stunt, although it received media coverage as concern about the "pledge card" funding grew. The Auditor-General and Solicitor-General both stated, in the Auditor-General's report to Parliament, their opinion that the pledge card expenditure was a breach of the Public Finance Act. Following the passage of the Labour Party's validating retrospective legislation on 18 October 2006, Darnton's lawsuit became defunct as the courts would rely on the retrospective provisions of the legislation.
Political response.
Corruption claims.
Based on the draft Auditor General's report, the National Party accused Labour of corruption, with Don Brash claiming that "Helen Clark's Labour Government is quite simply the most corrupt government in New Zealand history." He later amended that to "most corrupt in the last 100 years". The claim was made on the basis of deliberate over-spending under the Electoral Act being a "corrupt practice". Parliamentary debate rapidly deteriorated into shouting matches, with minor parties threatening a walk-out.
ACT New Zealand leader Rodney Hide disagreed with the term "corruption" being applied to the spending. "The AG's report doesn't show corruption. If it did National would be corrupt too. They were found to have misspent 10k. They would be corrupt too—just not as successful! I could see it was going to get ugly once the Nats went down the tactic of consistently labelling Labour corrupt… I disagree with everything that Labour does—but they are not corrupt. Devious and cunning, yes. Not corrupt."
Sleaze allegations.
In response to National calling Labour "corrupt", Labour ministers Trevor Mallard and David Benson-Pope made reference during Question Time to allegations Don Brash was having an affair with Business Roundtable vice chairwoman Diane Foreman. Rumours to that effect had been circulating for some time, however the allegations were not published by the media until National MP Brian Connell raised them in caucus and the ensuing debate was leaked to the media. The "Independent Financial Review" first published the allegations.
"Investigate" magazine then published a photograph with commentary implying that Clark's husband Peter Davis was gay. Other mainstream media outlets quickly republished the rumour. Clark and Davis emphatically denied the allegation. Campaigner Chuck Bird said he provided the photo to "Investigate" in protest against Labour's election spending.
Soon after, and within a day of saying that personal abuse had no place in NZ politics, Clark described Don Brash, leader of the opposition, as a "cancerous" and "corrosive" presence in national affairs, a statement for which she was later criticised. In an interview the following day she gave the example of a cartoon on the Young Nationals' website which had been there since before the election campaign, and indeed before Brash's leadership of the Party, depicting her as Star Wars villain Darth Vader telling Luke Skywalker she is his "lesbian father". Brash subsequently requested the image be taken down.
Told that the National Party had expressed sympathy for her, Ms Clark replied:
"I have very, very prominent friends in New Zealand life who have rung me… saying they were simply amazed at the sort of people, seemingly reputable citizens, who were prepared to pass on baseless lies as if they were factual."
Clark also claimed that the Exclusive Brethren had hired a private detective to follow Mr Davis and herself. Within a week, private detective Wayne Idour admitted being hired by the sect "to dig dirt" on Labour MPs and described some of the things he had found out as "alarming". He told the media that he would make these "alarming" discoveries public within a week. Nothing appeared.
"The Hollow Men".
Nicky Hager published "The Hollow Men: A Study in the Politics of Deception" in November 2006 after an interim injunction against the publication of Brash's private email correspondence was lifted at the request of Dr Brash's lawyer. Hager claims that the National Party spent millions of dollars in its election campaign without breaching the legal spending cap. He points to several possible breaches of the election law by National, and asserts that the scope of the Auditor General's inquiry was "very limited" and did not include illegal third party advertising. According to Hager, evidence from undisclosed sources and the leaked e-mails point to a breach of section 221 of the Electoral Act. He further asserts that the book "Postcard From Home", Brash's biography, was called a "significant marketing tool" by Brash, and that the National-produced "Fairtax postcards" were "exactly the same expense as Labour’s pledge card".
In addition, Hager disclosed a letter from the Exclusive brethren to Don Brash and John Key (later head of the National Party) stating that "We are working on 'our/your' campaign full-time" written in May 2005, four months before the election. According to the Sunday Star Times, this and other documents "confirm, that months before the election campaign, that National Party MPs and staff... were fully aware of the Exclusive Brethren advertising campaign and that at least some MPs had seen the draft publications".
The sources and alleged breaches by National in Hager's book remain controversial and have sparked a debate regarding the invasion of privacy versus the public interest. On 27 November 2006, the Greens called for further investigation.
Don Brash resigns.
On 12 December 2006, Don Brash resigned from the leadership of the National Party and subsequently retired from Parliament; the leadership of the party passed to John Key. Speculation exists that Don Brash resigned due to the allegations in Nicky Hager's book. However, Brash has said that the book was "not a factor" in his resignation.
Public response.
Most political commentators believe that Helen Clark misjudged the public mood on the alleged spending, calling it "a beltway issue" - that is, of interest only to those who are involved the political process and not of interest to ordinary voters. A TVNZ opinion poll showed a 13% lead to National during the fallout, but other polls showed Labour and National neck and neck. A TV 3 poll around the same time showed Labour ahead on 4 November 2006. Labour's rating remained within 2 points consistently during the debate. For the first time, some media reported dissatisfaction with Helen Clark's leadership amongst the Labour Party Caucus. Clark continued to lead the party until after their electoral defeat in the 2008 election.
Dominion Post commentator Chris Trotter wrote in the 20-Oct-06 Dominion Post that "Solicitor General Terence Arnold QC's "expansive" interpretation of the Parliamentary Services Act betrayed a woeful lack of knowledge about the way our political system operates", and continued:
His opinion characterised parliamentarians as glorified civil servants subject to executive oversight and prohibited from spending public funds on any form of political advocacy (which he appeared to regard as a private activity). In his version of parliamentary democracy, political parties are viewed as entities extraneous to Parliament and play no role in the day to day operations of government.
Mr Brady went on to compound the anti democratic, effect of the solicitor general's opinion by confining his investigation into "unlawful" parliamentary expenditure to election advertising. It was this decision, another "cock up", which allowed the Opposition to set in motion a major political conspiracy... The auditor general's office and the news media had both become important adjuncts to the Opposition's campaign to destroy Labour's political reputation.
As officers of Parliament, the capacity of the Auditor-General and Solicitor-General to respond to criticism is limited. However, Jim Evans, emeritus Professor of Law at Auckland University, responded to the critics of the Auditor-General's report on a blog saying that "various attempts [have] been made in recent weeks to obfuscate the issues surrounding the Auditor-General's report on advertising expenditure by political parties in the three months before the last general election".
Overhaul of election funding laws.
The government announced that, in light of the funding problems, they would look into changing the "Electoral Act 1993" surrounding election funding. Following the release of the Auditor-General's report, the Appropriation (Parliamentary Expenditure Validation) Bill was moved through Parliament in two days under urgency, being passed on 18 October 2006.
Later, the Government introduced the Electoral Finance Bill to reform electoral finance laws.

Neochlamisus

Neochlamisus is a genus of leaf beetles in the tribe Fulcidacini (the warty leaf beetles). They are members of the case-bearing leaf beetle group, the Camptosomata. Measuring 3–4 millimeters in length as adults, they are cryptic, superficially resembling caterpillar frass. Seventeen, sometimes 18 species are presently accepted in this genus, all of them occurring in North America (including Mexico; some were previously in the genus "Chlamisus").
Life history.
In the spring, female "Neochlamisus" lay eggs singly on the leaves or stems of their host plant and then form a case of fecal material around each. The larvae remain on the natal host plant and add to and enlarge their fecal cases as they grow. Case enlargement in "Neochlamisus" is an elaborate process that larvae perform regularly until the case is sealed to the substrate prior to pupation. During this stage of the life cycle, beetles are immobile and are particularly vulnerable to predation. After about twenty days the newly hardened adult cuts a clean circle around the apex of the case, lifts this cap, and flies off to feed and mate. "Neochlamisus" adults feed and mate on the larval host plant species.
"Neochlamisus" species are typically very host-plant-specific and most species primarily use but a
single host plant genus or even a single species. A rather well-known exception is "N. bebbianae" which feeds on particular species from six tree genera representing five different plant families. "N. bebbianae" populations associated with each of these plants are referred to as separate "host forms" and are the subject of ongoing studies of host-associated speciation.
Species.
Seventeen species are widely recognised:

J. Bazzel Mull

Jacob Bazzel Mull ( in Valdese, North Carolina – ) was a Christian minister and religious broadcaster in East Tennessee.
Biography.
Mull was the grandson of Wallace B. Mull, a circuit riding preacher in the 1800s. His parents and siblings had formed a Gospel music group, The Valdese Sacred Band, and Mull played banjo in the group as a child.
He had been legally blind since the age of 11 months, after an accidental fall into a fireplace had damaged his eyesight. He memorized verses from the Bible as someone read them aloud.
Mull began preaching in 1932. In 1939, Mull began preaching on radio stations in North Carolina. In 1942 he began a Gospel music program on two AM radio stations in Knoxville, Tennessee, WROL and WNOX. He later bought an FM station in Knoxville, WJBZ, which he nicknamed "Praise 96.3". Mull syndicated the program on nighttime clear-channel megastation WWL 870 AM in New Orleans and consequently became known among nighttime truck drivers across the United States. Commonly he was master-of-ceremonies with his wife Elizabeth and used the familiar by-line "This is your old neighbour J. Bazzel [then her voice] and Mrs. Mull [back to his voice] with your Mull—"M-U-L-L"—Singing Convention." Recordings by The Chuck Wagon Gang were frequent. The Mulls also broadcast recordings by Jimmie Davis, whom they habitually introduced as "twice Governor of the great State of Louisiana." Mull would solicit orders for the recordings, emphasizing that they were "pressed by Columbia" and that his address was in Knoxville, Tennessee, lest it be confused with the larger Nashville, which in the public mind was probably more identified with the musical style.
Mull branched into television in the 1950s. He hosted an hour-long Gospel music program, "The Mull Singing Convention", on Knoxville television, first on WBIR-TV and later on WVLT-TV. Mull's Gospel music program was also broadcast in Chattanooga, Tennessee, originally on WRGP-TV when that station went on the air in 1956. Mull's show moved to WTVC when it began broadcasting in 1959. He also used the Mull Singing Convention name on shape note hymnals, still published today.
Mull was a staunch Democrat even though he hailed from Republican East Tennessee. As a minister and a Democrat he was known for his humorous comment that the Lord rode a donkey, not an elephant, into Jerusalem. On 26 September 2006 Mull was eulogized on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives by John J. "Jimmy" Duncan Jr., who said that Mull's most famous line was "Ain't that right, Mrs. Mull?"
Mull was inducted into the Southern Gospel Hall of Fame in 2003.

Miklós Ajtai

Miklós Ajtai (born 2 July 1946) is a computer scientist at the IBM Almaden Research Center, United States. In 2003, he received the Knuth Prize for his numerous contributions to the field, including a classic sorting network algorithm (developed jointly with J. Komlós and Endre Szemerédi), exponential lower bounds, superlinear time-space tradeoffs for branching programs, and other "unique and spectacular" results. He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.
Selected results.
One of Ajtai's results states that the length of proofs in propositional logic of the pigeonhole principle for "n" items grows faster than any polynomial in "n". He also proved that the statement "any two countable structures that are second-order equivalent are also isomorphic" is both consistent with and independent of ZFC. Ajtai and Szemerédi proved the corners theorem, an important step toward higher-dimensional generalizations of the Szemerédi theorem. With Komlós and Szemerédi, he proved the "ct"2/log "t" upper bound for the Ramsey number "R"(3,"t"). With Komlós and Tusnády he proved in 1984 the AKT optimal matching theorem. The corresponding lower bound was proved by Kim only in 1995, a result that earned him a Fulkerson Prize. With Chvátal, Newborn, and Szemerédi, Ajtai proved the crossing number inequality, that any drawing of a graph with "n" vertices and "m" edges, where , has at least crossings. Ajtai and Dwork devised in 1997 a lattice-based public-key cryptosystem; Ajtai has done extensive work on lattice problems. For his numerous contributions in Theoretical Computer Science, he received the Knuth Prize.
Biography.
Ajtai received his Candidate of Sciences degree in 1976 from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Since 1995, he has been an external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
In 1998, he was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin. In 2012, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2021, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Équiterre

Équiterre is a Canadian non-profit and non-governmental organization, operating in Quebec. It manages a community-supported agriculture system of farms and consumers, including households and institutions.
The non-profit's mission at founding had two main threads: to improve the organic agriculture economy in Quebec through stimulation of consumer demand, and to ensure access of citizens to local organic products through direct support of producing farms.
Members of the managed network required abiding by four criteria:
History.
Équiterre was founded in 1993 by a group of young people including Steven Guilbeault, Laure Waridel, Sidney Ribaux, Patrick Henn, François Meloche and Beth Hunter who had participated in various preparatory conferences at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the previous year. This group shared the view that issues of poverty, the environment and North-South inequities must be considered in order for real change to occur in society. They decided to create an organization that would enable them to put their principles into action. Équiterre has since been devoted to implementing projects that focus on solutions rather than problems. The organization has grown thanks to the synergy of the many individuals who have joined its ranks.
Équiterre was incorporated as a non-profit organization in 1995 and was granted charitable status by Revenue Canada and Revenu Québec in 1996 (No. 894057132RR0001). In November 1998, "Équiterre" became the official name for Action for Solidarity, Equality, Environment and Development (A SEED).
Équiterre's first foray into community-supported agriculture (CSA) was with a farm in Mont St-Gregoire, Cadet-Roussel. The success of the first season with this farm led to the notion that management of a CSA network would be feasible.
One driver behind the formation of Équiterre was the consolidation and industrialization of agriculture in Quebec, which over the course of the twentieth century had reduced the number of farms from 200,000 down to 28,000, resulting in rural depopulation and economic depression.
In 2002, Équiterre started a program to connect its production network to daycare centers in Quebec to introduce locally grown food into the diets of young children. Along the same lines, the organization has piloted programs to provide hospitals and schools with organic produce produced by its CSA network as well.
Scale.
Équiterre operates its agriculture network solely in Quebec. In 1996, the organization's network consisted of seven farms and all deliveries were in Montreal. As of 2007, the organization's network consisted of 100 farms and 8,700 households. By 2014, the number of farms engaged remained at around 100.
Activities.
In addition to managing a community-supported agriculture (CSA) network, Équiterre engages in a number of additional activities. For instance, experienced farmers in the CSA network mentor beginning farmers, particularly in their first critical year. Far afield from agriculture, the organization is also certified to conduct energy audits for the Quebec and Canadian federal governments, and has a staff coordinator of energy-efficiency programs.

Ladies Love Outlaws (Waylon Jennings album)

Ladies Love Outlaws is an album by American country music artist Waylon Jennings, released on RCA Nashville in 1972. Together with Jennings' previous album "Good Hearted Woman", it marks his transition toward his Outlaw Country image and style. "Ladies Love Outlaws" coined the use of the term "Outlaw" to refer to the country music subgenre, which was developing at the time of its release.
Background.
At this time, Jennings was suffering from hepatitis and was hospitalized. Frustrated by RCA Records' control over him, and thinking that he would have no more hit records, Jennings was considering retiring and, after a long time of deficient work, he fired his manager Lucky Moeller. During his recovery, his drummer Richie Albright visited him and persuaded Jennings to try again. Meanwhile, his contract with RCA Records was nearing its end. Albright introduced Jennings to Neil Reshen, a New York lawyer who had experience handling bands and contract problems. Jennings engaged Reshen as his manager, who encouraged the singer to grow his hair and beard long to emphasize his "outlaw" image . Willie Nelson, who Reshen would also go on to manage, recalled later, "These were the days when Waylon was still in the clutches of RCA management that demanded he sing certain songs a certain way. Neil put a stop to that. He backed down the establishment." The brash Reshen renegotiated Jennings' deal with RCA Records, and by the time of the agreement, Jennings received complete artistic freedom over producing, recording and selection of material, and the cover art of his albums. This would set the stage for the "outlaw country" movement that would dominate the industry throughout the 1970s, and Jennings, along with Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and a handful of other like-minded renegades, would be its figurehead.
Recording.
The title of the album originated from the song "Ladies Love Outlaws", written by singer-songwriter Lee Clayton. The composition mentions Jennings in one of its stanzas, describing his relation with his wife Jessi Colter: "Jessi liked Cadillacs and diamonds on her hands, Waymore had a reputation as a ladies man/Late one night her light of love finally gave a sign, Jessi parked her Cadillac and took her place in line." Clayton proposed that Jennings record the track, and Jennings decided to use it for the title of his next RCA Records release. Jennings' usual producer Chet Atkins was delegating the production of albums to other studio members so he could focus on his career as an artist so he assigned Danny Davis to produce the album. Davis' collaboration with Jennings ended when Jennings grew tired of Davis' conservative restrictions, took a gun into the studio and threatened to "shoot off the fingers" of the producer or any musician who would play a pickup note. Atkins replaced Davis with producer Ronny Light. Recording took place at RCA Victor's Nashville studio through 1971–72, with the exception of "Thanks", which was recorded in 1970. The album's liner notes were written by "Los Angeles Times" critic Robert Hilburn.
In his autobiography, Jennings said he was dissatisfied with RCA Records' decision to release the album without consulting him and insisted that the recordings of him contained scratch vocals, which he intended to use to help the band obtain a good sound; he had planned on redoing the vocals later. He also said that the label published the unfinished album without asking him about his progress. While he was satisfied with the results of "Frisco Depot" and considered the song complete, he said that Hoyt Axton's "Never Been to Spain" was never planned for a release. Jennings said, "I still cringe when I hear myself singing 'Never Been to Spain'. It sounded like I'd never even been to Cleveland".
"Ladies Love Outlaws" and Jennings' previous album "Good Hearted Woman" marked a change in Jennings' appearance. The cover of "Ladies Love Outlaws" shows Jennings on a scene set in an Old West motif, dressed in black with a revolver strapped to his waist,looking at his five-year-old niece, Ladonna. Previously, Jennings kept his hair short and his face clean-shaven, and he wore suits. After the release of "Ladies Love Outlaws", he started to wear faded jeans and cowboy boots.
In 2013, "Ladies Love Outlaws" was remastered and made available for download by Legacy Recordings.
Reception.
The album was released in September 1972 and peaked at number eleven on "Billboard's" Top Country Albums. The duet with his wife Jessi Colter, "Under Your Spell Again", was released in 1971 as a single; it reached number 39 on "Billboard's" hot country singles. Critic Chet Flippo of "Rolling Stone" wrote a negative review of the album, calling it "vague and unfinished". Jennings liked the review; upon reading it he called Flippo and said that RCA released the album before time without his consent, and invited Flippo to accompany him on his bus during a tour. Author Dean Tudor called the songs on the album "exciting", and wrote that Jennings "finely calculated the art of creating the 'laid back' country sound, and finely complements the forceful, but subdued, instrumentation with vocals that never strain for dramatic effect". Tudor described the album's style as a "blurred" boundary between country and rock and roll. Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote that Jennings' performances offered him in a "deeply expressive terrain" as a vocalist. Jurek also wrote that Jennings "wrings emotion from songs rather than merely projecting them into a microphone".

Norman Naimark

Norman M. Naimark (; born 1944, New York City) is an American historian. He is the Robert and Florence McDonnell Professor of Eastern European Studies at Stanford University, and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. He writes on modern Eastern European history, genocide, and ethnic cleansing in the region.
Career.
Naimark received all of his degrees at Stanford. He taught at Boston University, and was a fellow at Harvard University's Russian Research Center before returning to Stanford as a member of the faculty in the 1980s. Naimark is of Jewish heritage; his parents were born in Galicia.
He is a member of the editorial boards of a number of professional journals, including "The American Historical Review" and "The Journal of Contemporary History".
He was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit by Germany.
He may be best-known for his acclaimed study, "The Russians In Germany". He wrote in a 2017 essay that genocide is often tied to war, dehumanization, and/or economic resentment. He writes, "if there weren’t other very good reasons to prevent war, the correlation between war and genocide is a good one".
Views on the definition of genocide.
Throughout his more recent works, Naimark argues that the "world needs a much broader definition of genocide" than set by the 1948 Genocide Convention to also include "nations killing social classes and political groups." In his 2010 work "Stalin’s Genocides", Naimark makes a case that the government of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin "killed systematically rather than episodically" and that Dekulakization, Holodomor and Great Purge "shouldn’t be seen as discrete episodes, but seen together", calling it "a horrific case of genocide – the purposeful elimination of all or part of a social group, a political group."
Naimark argues that they constitute genocide due to, among other factors, the intent of extermination that underpinned them: the quotas that sometimes were set on the number of people that needed to be executed or arrested, the dehumanizing language directed at kulaks, slogans promoted by activists openly calling for their extermination, and a "great deal of evidence of government connivance" regarding Holodomor. Naimark writes that early drafts of the UN Genocide Convention had included the killing of social and political groups in the initial definitions of genocide, but were dropped after the Soviet delegation threatened to veto the convention.
Reception.
The "Journal of Cold War Studies" asked several academic scholars of Soviet history, Joshua Rubenstein, Paul Hollander, Andrea Graziosi, Roman Szporluk, Jeffrey Hardy, Michael Ellman, and Jeffrey Rossman to write commentaries about Naimark's book about Stalin and genocide and the more expansive definition of genocide he supports. These were released as "Perspectives on Norman Naimark’s Stalin’s Genocides" (2012). 
In his critique, Joshua Rubenstein agrees with Naimark's characterization that both Hitler and Stalin deserve to be known as "genocidaires" from a contemporary standpoint. However, he also disagrees with Naimark's apparent equating of Hitler and Stalin because the Soviet Union prevented Nazi Germany's attempt to conquer and subjugate all of Europe, suggesting the Soviet system was therefore a lesser evil when seen in a historical context. 
Hollander also agrees with Naimark's use of a definition of genocide to include social and political groups. 
Andrea Graziosi's analysis was more critical than Naimark's, writing he "could have presented an even stronger case" because his analysis of the Great Terror is outdated and overemphasizes the nature of that purge (which primarily targeted elites), failing to reflect recent research that highlights the mass operations and targeted minority groups. Graziosi stated that his approach thus aligns more with older interpretations and neglects the true scope and systematic nature of the terror that victimized primarily ordinary people and specific ethnic groups. 
Jeffrey Hardy's review raises a critical question within the broader argument of Naimark's book. Hardy highlights the complexities of categorizing Stalin's victims, particularly the kulaks, who he believes were defined more by their perceived opposition to the regime than any inherent shared identity. Despite this, Naimark insists that the kulaks constitute a social 'group' targeted for genocide, a stance Hardy finds questionable. Furthermore, Hardy questions Naimark's decision to limit the designation of genocide to specific subgroups within the Soviet peasantry, rather than recognizing the widespread suffering as a whole. 
Michael Ellman takes the most critical view of the book: "The liberal interpretation of genocide that Naimark favors is... in line with recent jurisprudence. However, he fails to point out the boomerang effect of such an interpretation. According to a recent book by a U.S. specialist on genocide... the massacres of some of the native Americans by European settlers, the Atlantic Slave Trade, the use of a nuclear bomb against Nagasaki...should all be considered genocides. This would make the United States founded on two genocides and guilty... of more... In view of this boomerang effect, my advice to Western governments is to stick to a strict constructionist interpretation of genocide. Hence, I disagree with Naimark’s wish to classify Stalin’s mass murders as genocide."
Roman Szporluk agreed with Naimark about deeming Stalin's actions as genocidal. He also suggests that Naimark's book aligns with a lesser-known aspect of Marx's theory of class struggle. While Marx is often associated with revolutionary reconstitution of society, he also acknowledges the possibility of "common ruin" for the contending classes. Szporluk argues that Stalin's regime, with its widespread violence and purges, exemplifies this alternative outcome of class conflict, highlighting the destructive potential inherent in Marxist theory.
Stalin and post-War Europe.
Though primarily focused on the history of genocide, Naimark has also written books dealing with geopolitical history. He authored "" in 2019. In this work, he criticizes the notion that the outbreak of the Cold War in Europe after World War II was "inevitable". Throughout, Naimark argues that Stalin was far more amenable to a settlement with the Western Allies than previously thought and did not initially have a plan to build the cohesive Eastern Bloc of Soviet satellite states within Europe. He also states that, while Stalin imposed his will in some countries like Poland and East Germany, he surprisingly favored restraint and accommodation in others like Denmark, Finland, and Austria. Stalin's ultimate goal remained a Europe susceptible to Soviet influence, showcasing a leader navigating a delicate balance between dominance and diplomacy.

CTX (explosive-detection device)

The CTX (Computed Tomography X-ray) is an explosive detection device, a family of x-ray devices developed by InVision Technologies in 1990 that uses CAT scans and sophisticated image processing software to automatically screen checked baggage for explosives.
CTX-5000.
In 1994, the CTX-5000 became the first computed tomography explosive detection system certified by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The certification of the CTX-5000 followed nine years of development. During that time the FAA invested $90 million in explosives detection and nearly $8.6 million in the specific technology. From 1995 to 1997, the CTX-5000 was tested to solve the challenges involved in integrating an explosives detection system into a baggage system and to validate the estimated costs of wide-scale deployment of the systems.
CTX-5000 SP.
The CTX-5000 SP scanning system, an improved version of the CTX-5000 for checked baggage, was delivered to the FAA in 1997 and placed at several of the US's busiest and largest airports. From 1997 to 2000, more than 100 of the systems have been purchased by the FAA to install in US airports, according to InVision.
CTX-5500DS.
The CTX-5500DS is an automated explosives detection system that uses computed tomography to characterize materials in checked bags and automatically identify objects that could be improvised explosive devices. The CTX-5500DS is the most widely used, FAA-certified Explosives Detection System in the world. It can be used for either standalone applications or in an integrated manner with airport baggage handling systems. It can also be configured to detect other types of contraband material. The CTX-5500DS has an FAA-certified throughput of 384 bags per hour. Its Dynamic Screening (DS) capability offers flexibility by allowing manual or automatic switching between various screening modes.
CTX-2500.
The CTX-2500 is a small-sized explosives detection system that is half the length of earlier CTX models. The CTX 2500 utilizes a single rotating X-ray source to acquire positioning images and CT-slice images, thus achieving its smaller size. The CTX 2500 system is the first FAA-certified Explosives Detection System (EDS) mounted on a truck for easy mobility and access to cargo. One of the units costs approximately US$700,000.
CTX-9000.
The CTX-9000 DSi system is the world's fastest FAA-certified (Certification moved to TSA Transportation Security Lab in 2002) Explosives Detection System, handling 542 bags per hour. It features alternate operational modes yielding even higher throughputs. The CTX-9000 DSi is designed for integrated airport installations. Its 1-metre wide conveyor coordinates with standard airport baggage handling systems. The system's architecture utilizes modular components, helping to ease scanner upgrading and servicing. The scanner contains 4 active radiation-shielding curtains. In addition, the gantry rotates at 120 RPM, enabling a slice image to be generated within half a second. A high-speed RF data link connects the rotating gantry to the stationary part of the unit. An air-conditioning unit ensures high performance and reliability in hot, dusty and humid airport environments.
Competition.
In the late 1990s, L-3 Communications developed a competing computerized tomography system that also met FAA approval, however it was not TSA Qualified until late 2002. In November 1999, the FAA awarded a contract worth up to US$75 million to L-3 to purchase up to 60 of its explosive detection systems. The eXaminer 3DX 6000 explosive detection system developed by L-3 operates similarly to the CTX system.
In 2013 Rapiscan Systems made the first delivery of its RTT product. This machine operates with a non-rotating 360 degree multi source X-ray tube and detector array CT imaging system so the only moving part is the conveyor belt. This allows it to achieve a throughput of 1800 bags per hour.
Recent developments.
Recent research has evaluated the use of computer vision based algorithms that operate on the volumetric data used collected as CT-slice images by these and other manufacturers computed tomography (CT) baggage scanner machines for the automatic detection of other threat types (e.g. guns, knives, liquid containers) using 3D object classification.

Ace of Cakes

Ace of Cakes is an American reality television show that aired on the Food Network. The show focused on the daily operations of Duff Goldman's custom cake shop, Charm City Cakes, in Baltimore, Maryland, including small-business ownership, working with various vendors, tasting with customers, constructing cakes, and delivering his products.
Synopsis.
"Ace of Cakes" highlights the frantic activity encompassing the production of a substantial number of custom edible art cakes in a short period of time. The staff consists primarily of Duff Goldman's good friends who have varying personalities. They are frequently shown working long hours to build and decorate the cakes, yet are always making jokes to offset the alleged stress of hitting each deadline. Staff members sometimes drive the cakes to their final destinations, which can require road trips of several hundred miles. Goldman has an informal approach to running Charm City Cakes. He is known for using non-traditional cooking utensils such as blowtorches, belt sanders, and power saws, and more to construct his designs.
Some of the notable cakes created by Charm City Cakes include cakes for the Preakness Stakes horse race at Pimlico in Maryland, Baltimore Zoo, the premiere of the 2007 film "Hairspray," a replica of Radio City Music Hall for The Rockettes, a hatbox-shaped cake for an 80-year-old grandmother, the Hogwarts castle for the premiere of the fifth Harry Potter film in Los Angeles, an edible replica of Wrigley Field, a replica of the shark ray at the Newport Aquarium, a cake for the Paramount Pictures premiere of the DreamWorks Animation film "Kung-Fu Panda", and a replica of the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA. For the season finale of Season 5, the bakery's staff traveled to Hawaii to create a cake for the 100th episode of "Lost".
Episodes.
Season one of "Ace of Cakes" consisted of six episodes airing in early fall 2006. The show proved to be one of the highest-rated prime time shows in Food Network's history, causing the network to order 15 episodes for season two including a 2-hour-long episode featuring the official NFL cake for Super Bowl XLI. A one-hour special featured the show's first international delivery (to London, England) in an episode aired in December 2010. Season 10, planned to be the program's last (despite its popularity), premiered in January 2011 and had six episodes. The final episode featured a large-scale Delorean time machine cake created for Universal Studios' "Back to the Future" anniversary event in New York City. Seasons 1–5 have been released on DVD.
Production.
"Ace of Cakes" was shot on location at the bakery in Baltimore, Maryland, a converted church. The show has also featured other locations where Duff, Geof and occasionally others travel to in delivery of cakes such as Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., Miami, Boston, Alaska, and Hawaii, among others. The show was edited in Los Angeles at the show's production company, Authentic Entertainment, a subsidiary of Endemol.
Reception.
During Season 8, "Ace of Cakes" launched a new promotion concept involving a deck of Las Vegas-style playing cards.
"Ace of Cakes" has been a very large success with fans and critics alike. The show has brought Food Network some of the highest ratings it has ever received for a prime-time program. "Ace of Cakes" is also broadcast in the United Kingdom on food network, in Mexico and Latin America on FOXlife, in New Zealand on the Food Channel, in Australia on LifeStyle Food, in Spain on , and in Portugal on SIC Mulher.
On November 19, 2010, Food Network announced that the 10th season of "Ace of Cakes" would be its last. Season 10 began airing in January 2011, ending shortly thereafter in February.
In 2019, Food Network announced that Goldman would appear in a new series, "Buddy vs. Duff", where he competes against Buddy Valastro of the similar TLC series "Cake Boss" (both networks are now owned by Discovery Inc.).
Cancellation.
Many concluded that "Ace of Cakes" may have run its course, as there were few cake-related premises left to explore without the risk of repeating content or overextending the show's original concept. 
"Ace of Cakes", a popular Food Network series featuring Duff Goldman and his team at Charm City Cakes in Baltimore, concluded in late 2010. Each week, the team created up to 20 elaborate cakes, some requiring as much as 29 hours to complete. Over time, however, many felt the show had explored most cake-related concepts, making it increasingly difficult to introduce fresh ideas without repeating themes or overreaching creatively.

The American Dad After School Special

"The American Dad After School Special" is the second episode of the second season, and the twenty-fifth overall episode, of the animated comedy series "American Dad!". It aired on Fox in the United States on September 17, 2006, and is written by Dan Vebber and directed by Pam Cooke.
In the episode, Steve falls for an overweight girl, and the appearance-obsessed Stan is so appalled by the way she looks that he develops anorexia. Roger, however, falls for her, too, and attempts to sabotage her relationship with Steve.
Plot.
Steve, while attempting to escape from gym class, finds a hideout used by a gothic, overweight girl named Debbie, whom he finds fascinating and on whom he develops a crush. When Steve tells his father about his new girlfriend, Stan is delighted to hear the news and he even helps Steve to build up the courage to ask her out by using an explosive collar that will kill him within twenty-four hours if he doesn't. However, Stan messes up the programming while activating the device, accidentally setting it to kill Steve in just twenty-four minutes instead.
Eventually, Steve manages to ask Debbie out, and the two begin dating each other while making plans to invite Debbie to meet Steve's family. However, when Stan sees Debbie for the first time via security camera, he becomes appalled by the fact that she's fat, and he forces the family to hide in the safe room of their house until Debbie leaves. Francine and Hayley then berate Stan for his behavior, and they (along with Klaus) are even able to point out his hypocrisy in which he is somewhat overweight after letting himself go over time. When Stan realizes they're right after checking himself in the mirror, he decides to go on a crazy exercise program and starts to gain an unhealthy obsession with his weight. While working out, Stan meets a personal trainer named Zack, who is depicted as being verbally abusive while also wearing a trucker's cap, and he's able to help him with his constant workout routine.
Steve continues dating Debbie, not realizing that Roger is secretly in love with her, especially while watching them kissing each other. Meanwhile, Stan becomes surprised to learn that the more he exercises and the less he eats, the fatter and fatter he gets; he then suspects that Francine and Hayley are tampering with his vegetables to make him fatter, which turns out to be true. Shortly after, he is eventually suspended from the CIA for his "weight problem" when he passes out during a physical after taking just a couple of steps past the starting line. Upon coming home, Stan's family engages in an intervention with him over his weight problem, to which it’s revealed that Stan’s fat body was an illusion; instead, he was getting thinner to the point where he was almost becoming like a skeleton, and the reason for him thinking that he was getting fatter was because of it being a symptom of anorexia. It is also revealed that Stan's trainer, Zack, isn't a real person at all, but rather a figment of Stan's delusional imagination.
Francine, Hayley, and Steve are then able to force Stan to attend an anorexia support group, which is mostly populated by teenage girls (and run by a man who either doesn't notice or care that Stan is a grown man). During the meeting, Stan befriends an anorexic girl named Veronica, who teaches Stan how to consume food without actually eating it, which he's able to do when his family feeds him. He's even able to get rid of some of his food by feeding it to Klaus, who starts to become so big that he outgrows his fishbowl shortly after. Steve then decides to dump Debbie due to him thinking that it will help make his father feel better after believing that she was the source of Stan's weight problem. Stan then decides to set Steve up on a date with Veronica, thinking that she is much more suitable for his son due to her not being fat like Debbie.
Meanwhile, Francine is able to take out the garbage and drops an empty bottle onto the swimming pool cover. She accidentally falls into the pool while trying to get the bottle, and she and Hayley both shockingly discover all the uneaten food that Stan had gotten rid of, realizing that he never actually ate any of it when they tried to feed him.
During Steve's date with Veronica, Roger goes out with Debbie in the same restaurant while pretending to be part of an Anne Rice fan club. After realizing that Steve is also in the restaurant with them, he attempts to make Steve jealous by trying to make out with Debbie. Just then, Francine and Hayley both show up to confront Stan after they discovered his secret, and Steve becomes quite upset with his father after realizing that breaking up with Debbie didn't help him in any way. Steve then explains to Stan how much he loved Debbie, and that he didn't care if she was fat or thin while also calling out his displeasure of Stan's fatphobia. Debbie, who was in the same room as Steve, hears everything, and the two are happily reunited again, much to Roger's unhappiness. When Stan realizes how happy the two of them are together, he starts to feel bad on both the inside and the outside. He decides to start eating for real by dining on some rolls in the restaurant, which also causes Zack to disappear physically, ending Stan's anorexia.
Reception.
The episode was watched by a total of 7.71 million people; this made it the third most-watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to "The Simpsons" and "Family Guy" which had 9.23 million viewers. Daniel Solomon of "Cinema Blend" called the episode the best of the season: "The device that the writers use to display Stan's problem is both a visual metaphor for the distorted self-image of people with anorexia, as well as a narrative twist for the audience".

Duff Goldman

Jeffrey Adam "Duff" Goldman (born December 17, 1974) is an American businessman, pastry chef, television personality, and writer. He is the executive chef of the Baltimore-based Charm City Cakes shop, which was featured in the Food Network reality television show "Ace of Cakes", and his second, Los Angeles–based, shop Charm City Cakes West, which is featured in Food Network's "Duff Till Dawn" and "Cake Masters" series. His work has also been featured on the "Food Network Challenge", "Iron Chef America", "Oprah", "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno", "Man v. Food", "Buddy vs. Duff", "Duff Takes the Cake", and "Duff's Happy Fun Bake Time".
Early life, family and education.
Goldman was born in Detroit, Michigan, to a Jewish family. Goldman's nickname Duff came about when he was a baby. His toddler brother, Willie Goldman, was unable to pronounce Jeffrey and kept saying Duffy. When he was four years old, his mother caught him in her kitchen wielding a meat cleaver and watching food personality Chef Tell.
After the divorce of his parents when he was ten years old, Goldman resided in both Northern Virginia and in the town of Sandwich, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod. In 1992, Goldman attended McLean High School in McLean, Virginia where he played on the Highlanders ice hockey team. In 1993, he graduated from Sandwich High School.
At the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), he earned a bachelor's degree in East Asian History with a minor in Ethics. Thereafter, he attended Corcoran College of Art and the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in Napa Valley, California.
Early career.
From age fourteen, he began to work in kitchens; his first job was at a bagel store at a mall. Goldman also worked as a fry cook at McDonald's. Goldman has said that when he was a sophomore in college, he went to the Baltimore restaurant Charleston, which he considered the finest restaurant in Baltimore. Aspiring to be a cook there, he applied. The head chef, Cindy Wolf, looked at his résumé and noted that it consisted of irrelevant experience. However, Cindy did offer him a job to make cornbread and biscuits only, and this is what Goldman cites as the turning point in his career. He worked under acclaimed chefs in California, including a stagiaire position at the French Laundry and as executive pastry chef of the Vail Cascade Hotel in Colorado, he returned to Washington, D.C., to work at Todd English's restaurant, Olives, baking bread.
Charm City Cakes.
In 2002, Goldman made forays into the food industry when he started his own business by opening his own bakery called Charm City Cakes. Initially, his cake sales began as he worked out of his house in Charles Village in Baltimore, Maryland, with the help of two assistants he employed. As demand grew, he hired more employees, hiring painters, architects, and sculptors to work on the development and expansion of his bakery. Charm City Cakes frequently uses blow torches, as well as power tools such as grinders and drills to help create the underlying supports of cakes.
Goldman has made cakes for former President Barack Obama during his second inaugural ball in 2013, novelist Tom Clancy, the cast of "Lost", the "30 Rock" cast (along with a cake prop), actor Sir Roger Moore, and for pop singer Katy Perry's "Birthday" video.
Cookbooks.
Goldman has written three cookbooks: "Ace of Cakes: Inside the World of Charm City Cakes", "Duff Bakes: Think and Bake Like a Pro at Home," and "Super Good Baking for Kids."
Other televised appearances.
In 2022, Goldman competed in season seven of "The Masked Singer" as "McTerrier" of Team Good. After the performance of Loverboy's "Working for the Weekend", McTerrier's mask accidentally came off and he had to shield his head while the panelists shielded their eyes until a crew member had to run out and put the mask back on. He was the first to be eliminated.
Goldman is a judge on several Food Network cooking competitions, such as Holiday Baking Championship, Spring Baking Championship and Kids Baking Championship. He co-hosted the last show with Valerie Bertinelli from seasons 1-12, and with Kardea Brown in season 13.
Duff has appeared in "Guy's Grocery Games" - most notably the Season 25 Episode 18 episode titled "Delivery: All-Star Hanukkah", in which he competed against Aaron May and Eric Greenspan, and the judges were Antonia Lofaso, Catherine McCord, and Jonathan Waxman. All of whom are of Jewish descent, except for Ms. McCord, whose husband is Jewish.
Personal life.
As of 2021, Goldman lives in Los Angeles, California. He played bass guitar in an indie-rock band called "...soihadto...". He later became the bass player in the band Foigrock (a play on foie gras and rock and roll). He states his alternate dream job would be to perform as a bass player with the band Clutch. Goldman has made a wedding cake for Clutch's lead singer, Neil Fallon. In addition, Fallon's younger sister and Goldman's friend from college, Mary Alice Fallon-Yeskey, works at Charm City Cakes as the office manager.
Goldman is Jewish and enjoys giving back to the community. In an interview with , Goldman said "Tzedakah is very important to me. I’ve been so fortunate with everything that has happened to me, it would be a crime not to give back."
In 2012, Goldman lost toes in a motorcycle accident.
On April 2, 2018, Goldman proposed to Johnna Colbry, whom he later married. On September 25, 2019, Goldman spoke at Cornell University, discussing the importance of Jewish identity and tzedakah in his life. On August 8, 2020, the couple announced they were expecting their first child, expected in January 2021. In January 2021, their daughter was born.

Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome

Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, which affects the development of the teeth, eyes, and abdominal region.
Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome is part of the so-called iridocorneal or anterior segment dysgenesis syndromes, which were formerly known as anterior segment cleavage syndromes, anterior chamber segmentation syndromes or mesodermal dysgenesis. Although the exact classification of this set of signs and symptoms is somewhat confusing in current scientific literature, most authors agree with the classification cited here. Axenfeld Anomaly is known as the development of a posterior embryotoxon, associated with strands of the iris adhered to a Schwalbe line that has been displaced anteriorly, which when added to glaucoma is called Axenfeld Syndrome. Rieger's Anomaly is defined by a universe of congenital anomalies of the iris, such as iris hypoplasia, corectopia or polycoria. When systemic findings are added to Rieger's anomaly, such as bone, facial and/or dental defects, it is known as Rieger syndrome. The combination of both entities gives rise to the Axenfeld-Rieger Anomaly when there are no systemic abnormalities and Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome when there are.
Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome is a rare disease that affects the eye bilaterally, with an estimated prevalence of 1/200,000 people, without gender predilection, and is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance of variable expressivity. The genes that have been identified in approximately 50% of cases are PITX2 and FOXC1. Given the important hereditary factor, it is important to evaluate the most direct members of the family.
To explain the ocular alterations, there is a theory of the mechanism postulated by Shields et al., which implies an arrest in the migration of neural crest cells towards the third trimester of gestation, which leads to the persistence of primordial endothelial tissue in the iris and anterior chamber angle. Contraction of these membranes after birth leads to the progressive changes seen in some patients. This primordial endothelium also generates an excessive and atypical basement membrane, especially near the limbal corneal junction, which accounts for the prominent Schwalbe line. In the case of secondary glaucoma, it would be the consequence of dysgenesis in the chamber sinus.
Signs and symptoms.
The intensity of the symptoms can range from asymptomatic to florid symptoms, characterized by ocular and systemic diseases, affecting multiple organs that have in common their origin in the neural crest.
Eye manifestations.
Bilateral ocular manifestations are usually pathognomonic of the disease. In the case of children who develop glaucoma, they may attend the consultation with signs and symptoms of buphthalmos, photosensitivity, tearing, corneal decompensation, which associated with poor vision, can be completed with a strabismus. In the case of the adult, there is a greater chance of not presenting symptoms, so an ophthalmological control may be required to detect the problem. Using a slit lamp, a posterior embryotoxon characterized by a prominent anteriorly displaced Schwalbe's ring near the temporal corneal limbus can be revealed. The unexpected finding of a posterior embryotoxon as a single whitish irregular arcuate ridge, on routine examination, is not necessarily a diagnosis of ARS, as this occurs in a percentage estimated in the literature from 8% to 15% of the normal population. In the case of gonioscopy, we can observe that the extension of the posterior embryotoxon can be greater and be present in the 360○, with a variable thickness of the annulus and unusually detached and hanging within the anterior chamber. Regarding the iris, we can observe peripheral extensions to Schwalbe's line, which can be thin or thick and extend over the trabecular meshwork, obscuring the scleral spur and even pulling the iris and producing corectopia in iris tissue that can range from atrophy mild stromal to the presence of uveal ectropion, pseudopolycoria or even absence of iris or pseudoacorea. These chamber sinus anomalies predispose half of the cases to open-angle glaucoma, which can manifest throughout life and therefore require regular ophthalmological check-ups. Other related anomalies are strabismus due to alteration in the insertions of the extraocular muscles or secondary to amblyopia, and with a predisposition to exotropia and retinal detachment.
Extraocular manifestations.
In the case of pathologies that affect the extraocular organs, greater attention must be paid to anomalies in the cardiovascular system, since they represent the most worrying associations due to their repercussions at the systemic level. These are present in different structures that make it up, such as heart valve defects, the presence of Fallot's tetralogy, atrial septal defects or persistent truncus arteriosus. Other alterations described are craniofacial anomalies associated with hypoplasia of the midface, hypertelorism, telecanthus, maxillary hypoplasia, short nasolabial fold, thin upper lip and larger everted lower lip, which are typical facial characteristics although expressed in a variable way. Maxillary hypoplasia and poor tooth development produce a prognathic profile. Inspection of the oral cavity may show microdontia, hypodontia, oligodontia, and a thickened frenulum. The crowns of the anterior teeth may be conical or peg-shaped and the roots may be shortened, the gingival attachments may be reduced, and the enamel may be hypoplastic, contributing to poor dental health. There are other described associations such as umbilical, auditory, pituitary, psychomotor, size, urethral and anal anomalies as well as albinism.
Pathophysiology.
The molecular genetics of Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome are poorly understood, but center on three genes identified by cloning of chromosomal breakpoints from patients.
This disorder is inheritable as an autosomal dominant trait, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and only one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who has the disorder. As shown in the diagram, this gives a 50/50 chance of offspring inheriting the condition from an affected parent.
Diagnosis.
The age of diagnosis differs according to the intensity of the symptoms.
Although most recognized for its correlation with the onset of glaucoma, the malformation is not limited to the eye, as Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome when associated with the PITX2 genetic mutation usually presents congenital malformations of the face, teeth, and skeletal system.
The most characteristic feature affecting the eye is a distinct corneal posterior arcuate ring, known as an "embryotoxon". In severe cases, iris may be adherent to the cornea anterior to the Schwalbe's line.
One of the three known genetic mutations which cause Rieger syndrome can be identified through genetic samples analysis. About 40% of people with Axenfeld–Rieger have displayed mutations in genes PITX2, FOXC1, and PAX6. The difference between Type 1, 2, and 3 Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome is the genetic cause, all three types display the same symptoms and abnormalities.
Classification.
The OMIM classification is as follows:
Detection of any of these mutations can give patients a clear diagnosis and prenatal procedures such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis, chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis can be offered to patients and prospective parents.
Management.
One of the surgical techniques used to treat this rare disease is the Phakic Retroiridian Pupilloplasty is an original surgical technique involving the creation of a sclerocorneal incision through a peripheral iridotomy, with the surgeon working behind the iris and creating a neopupil with an anterior chamber vitrectome. It requires very few follow-up visits and the patient's recovery is fast.
Eponym.
It is named after the German ophthalmologist Theodor Axenfeld who studied anterior segment disorders, especially those such as Rieger syndrome and the Axenfeld anomaly.
Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome is characterized by abnormalities of the eyes, teeth, and facial structure. Rieger syndrome, by medical definition, is determined by the presence of malformed teeth, underdeveloped anterior segment of the eyes, and cardiac problems associated with the Axenfeld anomaly. The term "Rieger syndrome" is sometimes used to indicate an association with glaucoma. Glaucoma occurs in up to 50% of patients with Rieger syndrome. Glaucoma develops during adolescence or late childhood, but often occurs in infancy. In addition, a prominent Schwalbe's line, an opaque ring around the cornea known as posterior embryotoxon, may arise with hypoplasia of the iris. Below average height and stature, stunted development of the mid-facial features and mental deficiencies may also be observed in patients.

Chastleton

Chastleton is a village and civil parish in the Cotswold Hills in Oxfordshire, England, about northeast of Stow-on-the-Wold. Chastleton is in the extreme northwest of Oxfordshire, on the boundaries with both Gloucestershire and Warwickshire. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 153.
Archaeology.
Chastleton Barrow or Burrow is an Iron Age hill fort southeast of the village. It is fortified with a single bank built of oolite and earth that encloses an area of about . Part of the fort was excavated in about 1881 and sections of the bank and areas near it were excavated in 1928–29. Hearths were found, along with Iron Age pottery and other artefacts that are now held at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. These artefacts were used to date the fort as Early Iron Age, which in Britain is about 800 to 400 BC. The fort is now marked by a ring of mature trees.
In the eastern part of the parish are a number of prehistoric sites including a tumulus that still retains a few of the stones that formed its burial chamber. Archaeological examination of the surface at the centre of the tumulus found three flints that showed signs of being worked and two small fragments of human skull. At Lower Brookend Farm in the north of the parish are the remains of a linear fishpond formed by damming a brook. It is either medieval or post-medieval and seems to have been abandoned by about 1800.
Manor.
The earliest known record of the manor is from 777, when Offa, King of Mercia, gave land at Chastleton to Eynsham Abbey. The name derives from Old English; the prefix likely from "ceastel", signifying a cairn or boundary marker, and the suffix from "ton", a town. In the "Domesday Book", the manor is recorded as "Cestitone", and its landowners as Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, Henry de Ferrers and Urse d'Abetot. Later, in the Middle Ages, the manor's owners included Robert D'Oyly, the likely builder of Oxford Castle, and Thomas Chaucer, son of Geoffrey. 
Next to the parish church is Chastleton House, one of England's finest and most complete Jacobean houses, and a Grade I listed building. Completed in 1612, the house has been occupied by members of the Jones family since 1602. It is now owned by The National Trust who opened the property to the public in 1997 after six years of conservation work. The house is full of objects accumulated by the family over the years: rare tapestries, portraits, furniture, as well as personal belongings, some just lying around, such as walking sticks and Wellington boots. The gardens are typically Elizabethan and Jacobean, with a ring of topiary at their centre. The middle lawn is regarded as the birthplace of croquet and visitors may play there today with equipment provided by the National Trust.
Parish church.
The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin was built late in the 12th century, was enlarged and refenestrated in the 14th century. It has a south bell tower that was added in 1689 and has a ring of six bells. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

Pehčevo (, ) is a small town in the eastern part of North Macedonia. It is the seat of Pehčevo Municipality. Pehčevo is known for its winter tourism.
History.
In the late 19th and early 20th century, Pehčevo was part of the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. According to the statistics of Bulgarian ethnographer Vasil Kanchov from 1900, 4070 inhabitants lived in Pehčevo, 3300 Bulgarian Muslims, 700 Bulgarian Exarchists and 70 Romani.
In 1913, as a result of the Balkan Wars, the town became a part of the Kingdom of Serbia, which in 1918 joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (in 1929 renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia).
In 1922 many Gallipoli Serbs, adherents of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, arrived in Yugoslavia as refugees from Gelibolu and part of them were resettled here. Their number in Pehčevo was ca 1,100
From 1929 to 1941, Pehčevo was part of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.
From 1941 to 1944, during the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, Pehčevo, along with most of Vardar Macedonia, was annexed by the Kingdom of Bulgaria.

Ample Destruction

Ample Destruction is the first studio album released by American power metal band Jag Panzer, released in 1984. Originally released on Azra Records (a small independent label), it received poor marketing from the label, thus only becoming an underground hit amongst the metal community, being bootlegged repeatedly.
Re-issues.
The album was re-issued officially twice by two different companies, though the track listings were the same, with three bonus tracks: "Black Sunday", "Eyes of the Night" and "Lying Deceiver".
There is also one other version of the album which includes four tracks from the "Tyrants" EP ("Battlezones", "Death Row", "Metal Melts with Ice" and "Iron Shadows"), one track from the Tyrants era ("Tower of Darkness") and four unreleased tracks from the "Ample Destruction" era ("Instrumental", "Black Sunday", "Eyes of the Night" and "Fallen Angel"). This version was marketed by Azra International and includes lyrics for all 18 tracks.

<doc id="6935871" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6935871" title="Bridge Base Online">
Bridge Base Online

Bridge Base Online (BBO) is the world's largest bridge-playing online platform, with about 11.6 million monthly visits as of September 2024.
History.
In 1990, Bridge Base Inc. was founded by Fred Gitelman and Sheri Winestock and released BASE II, an analytical tool for serious bridge players that ran on DOS. In 1992, teaching software, Bridge Master, was released for MS-DOS. In 1998, Bridge Master for Microsoft Windows was released. Also in 1998, an online bridge offering in Microsoft Gaming Zone, later MSN Games, was supplied by Bridge Base.
Created by professional bridge player Fred Gitelman, BBO was first published by Bridge Base, Inc. in 2001 as a Windows downloadable software offering free online multiplayer bridge rooms for practice and play. Around 2008, BBO was ported to a web application to also support Linux and macOS users, as well as mobile devices.
In 2018, Bridge Base Online was inducted into the American Contract Bridge League's Hall of Fame for its long-term commitment to bridge. As of February 2022, BBO was the only organization ever inducted by the Hall of Fame.
Main features.
In addition to bridge rooms for casual play and teaching, BBO hosts many types of duplicate bridge tournaments, including events sanctioned by official bridge organizations such as the American Contract Bridge League or the English Bridge Union, which award official masterpoints to players.
Bridge Base Online also features free tools that help novice players learn and improve their game skills, like 'Bridge Master' and 'Minibridge'. Partnerships can practice their bidding methods at Teaching Tables. Users can register at no cost. Many playing activities are also free, while premium tournaments charge an entry fee. Players may also rent robots for play practice.
A significant contribution to the game is the Vugraph "broadcasts", which presents live matches from around the world, enhanced by expert commentary. Because the language of bridge bidding and play uses only 15 words and all selections are done via mouse click, people who speak different languages can play together. BBO's interface supports many languages, and it allows players and "kibitzers" to chat, mainly using a text-based interface, at tables and other virtual rooms. Records of hands played are archived and are publicly accessible, enabling players to view their own and other competitors' actions.
Robots in BBO.
BBO also offers playing robots, which allow users to practice or compete without human partners and/or opponents, even in high-end competitive events. An example is the "NABC Robot Individual", a 3-day duplicate tournament where about 2000 players compete for an ACBL national title while partnering with robots. 
The main BBO robot is also known as Ginsberg's Intelligent Bridge player (GIB). GIB is an artificial intelligence bridge player. It can be rented on BBO. It plays the 2/1 game forcing system and can be used to fill in for one or more players or to provide advice. 
For players who want to practice extensively, BBO offers a subscription ("BBO+") that allows a choice of robots that play different bidding systems.
American Contract Bridge League.
In partnership with the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL), Bridge Base Online sponsors ACBL-sanctioned tournaments on its website. These tournaments award ACBL masterpoints©. Masterpoints awarded for online play can be combined with other types of ACBL masterpoints, which helps players achieve higher ACBL ranks.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, BBO partnered with ACBL and The Common Game to initiate an online platform named ACBL Virtual Clubs. This grew significantly during the pandemic by allowing duplicate bridge clubs to hold their games via an online platform, with most of the game fees going to the clubs. Collusive cheating, which is very easy on BBO and all but impossible to prove except through statistical means, became a significant issue during this period. In response, the ACBL announced it was joining forces with the EDGAR foundation and BBO, effective February 1, 2024.
Browser Add-ons and extensions.
Several browser add-ons have been developed to enhance the functionality of BBO. These include BBO Helper (double dummy display and many other features), BBOAlert (for remembering and automatically alerting complex system agreements), BBO Extractor (PBN and CSV download of boards), and BBO Visual Assist (for the visually impaired).
Competitors.
The increase in online play during the COVID-19 pandemic has generated new competitors such as Swan Bridge, IntoBridge, and RealBridge.

Adam and Company

Adam and Company Investment Management Limited is a wealth management company based in Edinburgh, Scotland offering discretionary investment management and wealth planning services to high-net-worth clients in the UK.
Founded in 1983, it is named after Adam Smith, a leading figure of the Scottish Enlightenment era who revolutionised economic theory in 1776 with the publication of "An inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations".
In 2021, the business was acquired by Canaccord Genuity Group through its UK wealth management business, Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management. 
History.
The bank was founded by Sir Iain Noble and another partner in 1983, opening its first branch in Charlotte Square, Edinburgh on 29 May 1984. In 1986, Adam and Company acquired London-based Continental Trust and later established an international arm in Guernsey. Branches in Glasgow, Manchester and Aberdeen were also opened between 1987 and 2005.
Royal Bank of Scotland.
In 1993, following substantial foreign-exchange related losses, Adam and Company was acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland who provided the capital needed to rebuild the Bank's weakened balance sheet. After the Royal Bank of Scotland acquired NatWest in 2000, restructuring of the group saw Adam and Company placed in the bank's Wealth Management Services division, alongside rival Coutts, the largest private bank in the UK.
In 2002, Adam and Company acquired Stewart Ivory Wealth Management.
In late 2011, the company moved its registered office to a newly refurbished Georgian townhouse at 25 Saint Andrew Square.
During the years until 2012, Adam and Company established itself as a bank for the wealthy. In 2012, Adam and Company became the first UK bank to implement the Avaloq investment and banking platform which paved the way for integration with Coutts and a range of efficiency savings leading to job losses for almost half of the workforce.
The Adam International business in Guernsey closed in 2012 and the Manchester office closed in 2014 after 15 years of operations.
In 2014, as part of a wider and more radical shake-up to the divisional structure of the parent company, Adam and Company, under the leadership of Graham Storrie, was made a subsidiary of Coutts and consolidated into the Commercial and Private Banking division of RBS, under divisional CEO Alison Rose.
In early 2018, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (now NatWest Group) announced its plans for restructuring to comply with new UK-wide rules on ring-fencing retail banking operations from investment banking operations. As part of this restructuring, all retail banking assets of the Royal Bank of Scotland were transferred to Adam and Company, which was renamed Royal Bank of Scotland. Adam and Company continued as a private banking brand operating on the main PRA licence of RBS, where customers enjoyed privileged services such as relationship management and discounts on standard retail banking products but where FSCS protection for deposits and other regulatory matters were not distinct from those relating to high street banking customers.
In 2022, RBS transferred the banking and lending business to Coutts &amp; Co. using a banking business transfer scheme approved by the Court of Session in Edinburgh under Part VII of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
Canaccord Genuity.
In 2021, the investment management business was acquired by Canaccord Genuity Group through its UK wealth management business, Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management for a cash consideration of £54 million.

Relationship education

Relationship education and premarital counseling promote practices and principles of premarital education, relationship resources, relationship restoration, relationship maintenance, and evidence-based marriage education.
History.
The formal organization of relationship education in the United States began in the late 1970s by a diverse group of professionals concerned that the results of conventional methods and means of marriage therapy resulted in no appreciable reduction in the elevated rate of divorce and out-of-wedlock births.
The motivation for relationship education was found in numerous studied observations of the elevated rates of marital and family breakdown, school dropouts, incarceration, drug addiction, unemployment, suicide, homicide, domestic abuse and other negative social factors when divorce and/or out-of-wedlock pregnancy were noted. In all of the negative categories noted above, statistical over-representation of adults whose childhood did not involve both of their parents was present.
Initial planning for the field of relationship education involved the participation of psychologists, counselors, family life educators, social workers, marriage and family therapists, psychiatrists, clergy from various faith traditions, policymakers, academicians in the fields of social science, attorneys, judges, and lay persons. The goal was to seek the broadest possible dispersal of research and marriage education skills courses which could improve interpersonal relationship functioning, especially with married and pre-marital couples.
Early contributors to the field of relationship education included David and Vera Mace, who founded The Association for Couples in Marriage Enrichment. The Maces conducted their first couples retreat in 1962. Bernard and Louise Guerney launched the "Institute for the Development of Emotional and Life Skills," later known as "Relationship Enhancement," in 1972. 
Examples.
The National Council on Family Relations focuses on preparing professionals in family life education, a prominent approach to relationship education.
In 2006, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services began funding significant multi-year demonstration projects through the Administration for Children and Families to expand the availability of marriage education classes in more than 100 communities nationwide. This project, known as the "Healthy Marriage Initiative," was designed to improve the well-being of children by providing tools and education to strengthen marriages and families.
Jeffry H. Larson conducted several studies on marriage and relationship education, including a review of three widely used premarital inventories – Focus, Prepare, and Relate.
Studies.
Relationship education for premarital couples.
A multi-year US federal study, known as the Building Strong Families Program, and 2010 meta-analysis of 47 studies found that relationship education "does not improve relationship quality/satisfaction" for unmarried couples.
"Previous studies have asserted that premarital education programs have a positive effect on program participants. Using meta-analytic methods of current best practices to look across the entire body of published and unpublished evaluation research on premarital education, we found a more complex pattern of results. We coded 47 studies and found that premarital education programs do not improve relationship quality/satisfaction when unpublished studies are included in the analysis, although studies that follow couples past the honeymoon stage to detect prevention effects are rare. In contrast, premarital education programs appear to be effective at improving couple communication, with studies that employed observational measures rather than self-report measures producing large effects. Still, given the mixed, modest results, there is ample room and a real need to improve the practice of premarital education."
Relationship education for married couples.
Several studies, notably the Supporting Healthy Marriage Project funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, a meta-analysis by Hawkins and Ooms and a five-year impact report by Peluso, Eisenberg and Schindler found that relationship education provided statistically significant benefits for married couples.
"The emerging evidence suggests that MRE [marriage and relationship education] programs can work for low-income populations as well as for those who are economically better off. The evidence from a new meta-analysis of 15 program evaluations (including three randomized control trials) shows that MRE programs can have positive, moderate size effects on low-income couples’ relationship outcomes, at least in the short run. However, the largest and most rigorous study of low-income, unmarried couples produced mixed results and shows there is still much to learn ... Across nearly all the studies reviewed for this Report, MRE improves communication—a core, essential relationship skill—as well as other measures of relationship quality. There is also some initial evidence that MRE for low-income couples can decrease divorce rates, reduce aggression, and improve children’s problem behaviors."

Anthony Pleeth, born in 1948 in London, is an English cellist, specialising in the historically informed performance of music of the 18th and 19th centuries on period instruments.
Biography and career.
He studied cello with his father, renowned cellist William Pleeth, at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he was the Gold Medallist in 1966. He made his first recording for the BBC at the age of 13. He was a founder of the Galliard Trio (with Trevor Pinnock, harpsichord and Stephen Preston, flute), with which he performed from 1965 to its disbanding in 1972.
He was the principal cellist of The Academy of Ancient Music, and later of The English Concert, leaving in 1985, but remaining a member of the English Concert Chamber Group until 1991. His recordings have included cello concertos by Vivaldi with The English Concert and The Academy of Ancient Music as well as being the cello soloist in many orchestral pieces and concerti grossi with these two orchestras. He has recorded the complete cello sonatas of Geminiani and Marcello (with Christopher Hogwood and Richard Webb,) and Vivaldi (with Robert Woolley and Suki Towb), trio sonatas by Handel and Corelli and chamber music by J. C. Bach with the English Concert Chamber Group. With fortepianist Melvyn Tan, he recorded Beethoven's complete sonatas and variations for cello and piano. His musical interests are not limited to period performance; he plays modern cello and his cello ensemble has performed and recorded "Bachianas Brasileiras" 1 and 5.
He was appointed professor of cello at the Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama in 1969 and at the Royal College of Music in 1986.
Aside from Classical appearances, he has also been on many film soundtracks, such as "We Were Soldiers" by Nick Glennie-Smith, "Gladiator" by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard and "" by Daft Punk.

Ekla Chalo Re

Jôdi Tor Dak Shune Keu Na Ase Tôbe Ekla Chôlo Re ("If no one responds to your call, then go your own way alone"), commonly known as Ekla Chôlo Re, is a Bengali patriotic song written by Rabindranath Tagore in 1905.
Originally titled as "EKLA", the song was first published in the September 1905 issue of "Bhandar" magazine. It was based and influenced by the Vaishnavite song "Harinaam Diye Jagat Matale Amar Ekla Nitai Re", which was a popular Bengali "Kirtan" song of "Dhapkirtan" or Manoharshahi "gharana" praising Nityananda, disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. "Ekla Chalo Re" was incorporated in the "Swadesh" (Homeland) section of Tagore's lyrical anthology "Gitabitan".
The song exhorts the listener to continue their journey, despite abandonment or lack of support from others. It is often quoted in the context of sociopolitical change movements and was a favourite of Mahatma Gandhi.

&lt;poem&gt;If they answer not to thy call;
Walk alone.
If they are afraid and cower mutely facing the wall;
O thou unlucky one! ,
If they are afraid and cower mutely facing the wall;
Open thy mind,
And speak out alone.
If they turn away, and desert you when crossing the wilderness;
O thou unlucky one! ,
If they turn away, and desert you when crossing the wilderness;
Trample the thorns under thy tread,
And along the blood-lined track travel alone.
If they do not hold up the light when the night is troubled with storm;
O thou unlucky one! ,
If they do not hold up the light when the night is troubled with storm;
With the thunder flame of pain ignite thy own heart,
And let it burn alone.&lt;/poem&gt;
History.
Writing.
"Ekla Chalo Re" was written at Giridih town in modern-day Jharkhand, India. It was one of the 22 protest songs written during the Swadeshi period of Indian freedom movement and along with "Amar Sonar Bangla", it became one of the key songs for the Anti-Partition Movement in Bengal Presidency in 1905.
Titled as "Eka" ("Alone") the song was first published in the September 1905 issue of "Bhandar" magazine. "Eka" was first included in Tagore's song anthology "Baul" in 1905. In 1941, it was incorporated into the "Swadesh" ("Homeland") section of "Gitabitan", the complete anthology of Tagore's music.
The musical notation of "Ekla Chalo Re" was prepared by Indira Devi, a niece of Tagore. The notation was first published in the April–May 1906 issue of "Sangeet-Vignan Prakashika" magazine and later incorporated into the 46th volume of "Swarabitan", the complete collection of Tagore's musical notations.
Recording.
"Ekla Chalo Re" was first recorded by Rabindranath Tagore sometime between 1905 and 1908. The cylinder record labelled H. Bose Swadeshi Records is now lost. Two other records of the song made by Harendranath Dutta (record no P5270) and Hindustan Party (comprising Amala Dutta, Nandita Devi, Sudhin Dutta and Santidev Ghosh) (record no H 191) are released by Gramophone Company of India and Hindustan Records respectively.
Eminent Rabindra Sangeet singer Suchitra Mitra recorded this song twice, first in 1948 (record no N27823), for the film Sandipan Pathshala, then in 1984 (record no PSPL 1501). There is also a third recording of this song by Suchitra Mitra from the album Rupantori (1988). She also recorded the song for the fourth time, with the sarod being played as background music, by Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, from the album Tribute to Tagore.
In popular culture.
In 2004, "Ekla Chalo Re"'s tune was used with Hindi lyrics composed by A.R Rahman and sung by Sonu Nigam in the movie "". In the 2012 Bollywood film "Kahaani", it is sung by actor Amitabh Bachchan under music direction of Vishal–Shekhar. Earlier, it was sung by Kishore Kumar, under the direction of Hemanta Mukhopadhyay. It was recorded by Hemanta Mukherjee in 1989.

Jean Théophile Victor Leclerc

Jean Théophile Victor Leclerc (), a.k.a. Jean-Theophilus Leclerc and Theophilus Leclerc d'Oze (1771–1820), was a radical French revolutionary, publicist, and soldier. After Jean-Paul Marat was assassinated, Leclerc assumed his mantle.
Leclerc was the son of a civil engineer and joined the National Guard in Clermont-Ferrand at the outbreak of revolution in 1789. He then went to Martinique as a merchant's agent. However, his militant pro-revolutionary stance brought him into conflict with the planter aristocracy, who soon expelled him for revolutionary propaganda in 1791. He returned to metropolitan France and joined the 1st battalion of Morbihan in which he served until February 1792, when he left for Paris to defend seventeen grenadiers accused, in Martinique, of being revolutionaries. He successfully defended them in front of the Jacobin Club and the revolutionary national assembly. On April first that year he made a speech before the Jacobin Club calling for the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.
Leclerc returned to his military duties with the Army of the Rhine, and was sent on an unsuccessful spy mission across the Rhine in southwest Germany. It seems that he was betrayed by Dietrich, the mayor of Strasbourg. In November 1792, he fought at the Battle of Jemappes. In February 1793 he was transferred to the General Staff of the newly restructured Army of the Alps, in Lyon. It was there that he joined the "Club Central" and he was sent to Paris as a special deputy from Lyon.
Leclerc took an extremely radical revolutionary position, even being expelled from the Jacobin Club for being too radical. He was a founding member of "Les enragés" (literally "the Angry Ones") who opposed Jacobian leniency. In 1793, he married Pauline Léon, who together with Claire Lacombe had founded the "Société des républicaines révolutionnaires", a radical and revolutionary feminist organization which was banned the following year. He and his wife published a broadsheet called "L'Ami du peuple par Leclerc" starting in 1793, which advocated a radical purging of the army, the creation of a revolutionary army made up exclusively of the partisans of the Reign of Terror, and the execution of all the suspected anti-revolutionaries. His publishing activities ceased with his arrest in April 1794. After his release in August 1794, he and his wife maintained a low profile until his death in 1820.

A. O. Shirley Recreation Ground

The AO Shirley Recreation Ground is a multi-use stadium in Road Town, British Virgin Islands. It is currently used mostly for football matches and usually hosts the British Virgin Islands national football team's games. The stadium holds 1,500 people.
History.
The Ground was named in honor of Alexander O. Shirley in June 1990. Shirley, a cricketer who also served as the Accountant General of the British Virgin Islands from 1967 to 1987, had requested land to build the ground from the Administrator of the British Virgin Islands. Shirley remains the only British Virgin Islander to have a ground named for him. The ground has traditionally been open for free for public recreation when its not used for formal sports matches. In 2022, it was reported that the Recreation Trust had locked the gates of the only entrance to the stadium and wanted to charge the public $30 a month to use the facilities. However, the Trust stated it was only a proposal and there had not been a public consultation on it.
Cricket.
The ground has also been used as a venue for cricket matches, with the first recorded cricket match played there in 1988 between a Combined Virgin Islands and Nevis. Three years later, the British Virgin Islands cricket team first played there against Anguilla in the 1991 Leeward Islands Tournament. Just over a decade later, the Leeward Islands played a first-class match there against the Windward Islands in the 2001/02 Busta Cup. This is the only first-class match to be played at the ground. The last recorded cricket match played there was in 2005. The ground's end names are the Police Station End and the Super Value End.

Alpha cleavage

Alpha-cleavage (α-cleavage) in organic chemistry refers to the act of breaking the carbon-carbon bond adjacent to the carbon bearing a specified functional group.
Mass spectrometry.
Generally this topic is discussed when covering tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation and occurs generally by the same mechanisms.
For example, of a mechanism of alpha-cleavage, an electron is knocked off an atom (usually by electron collision) to form a radical cation. Electron removal generally happens in the following order: 1) lone pair electrons, 2) pi bond electrons, 3) sigma bond electrons.
One of the lone pair electrons moves down to form a pi bond with an electron from an adjacent (alpha) bond. The other electron from the bond moves to an adjacent atom (not one adjacent to the lone pair atom) creating a radical. This creates a double bond adjacent to the lone pair atom (oxygen is a good example) and breaks/cleaves the bond from which the two electrons were removed.
In molecules containing carbonyl groups, alpha-cleavage often competes with McLafferty rearrangement.
Photochemistry.
In photochemistry, it is the homolytic cleavage of a bond adjacent to a specified group.

Peanut butter cookie

A peanut butter cookie is a type of cookie that is distinguished for having peanut butter as a principal ingredient. The cookie originated in the United States, its development dating back to the 1910s.
History.
George Washington Carver (1864–1943), an American agricultural extension educator, from Alabama's Tuskegee Institute, was the most well known promoter of the peanut as a replacement for the cotton crop, which had been heavily damaged by the boll weevil. He compiled 105 peanut recipes from various cookbooks, agricultural bulletins, and other sources. In his 1925 research bulletin called "How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it for Human Consumption", he included three recipes for peanut cookies calling for crushed or chopped peanuts.
It was not until the early 1930s that peanut butter was listed as an ingredient in the cookies.
Fork pressing and patterning.
Early peanut butter cookies were either rolled thin and cut into shapes, or else they were dropped and made into balls; they did not have fork marks. The first reference to the famous criss-cross marks created with fork tines was published in the "Schenectady Gazette" on July 1, 1932. The "Peanut Butter Cookies" recipe said: "[s]hape into balls and after placing them on the cookie sheet, press each one down with a fork, first one way and then the other, so they look like squares on waffles."
Pillsbury, one of the large flour producers, popularized the use of a fork in the 1930s. The "Peanut Butter Balls" recipe in the 1933 edition of "Pillsbury's Balanced Recipes" instructed the cook to press the cookies using fork tines. These early recipes do not explain why the advice is given to use a fork, though. The reason is that peanut butter cookie dough is dense, and unpressed, each cookie will not cook evenly. Using a fork to press the dough is a convenience of tool; bakers can also use a cookie shovel (spatula).

The Rounders (1965 film)

The Rounders is a 1965 American Western comedy film directed by Burt Kennedy and starring Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda. It is based on the 1960 novel of the same name by Max Evans.
Plot.
Ben Jones and Marion "Howdy" Lewis are two easygoing, modern-day cowboys who make a meager living breaking wild horses. Their frequent employer is Jim Ed Love, a shrewd businessman who always gets the better of them. After they bring him a string of tamed horses and spend the winter rounding up stray cows, he talks them into taking an undistinguished roan horse in lieu of some of their wages.
To his great and frequent discomfort, Ben finds that the horse is unrideable. Rather than turning the horse into soap or dog food, he decides to take it to a rodeo and bet other cowhands that they cannot ride it, thereby doubling his and Howdy's earnings. Along the way, the duo stop to help two dimwitted strippers, Mary and Sister, with their car, which has broken down. Not knowing much about cars, they give them a ride to the nearest garage, but end up getting to know them better (going skinny dipping with them) and taking them along to the rodeo. The girls unfortunately lose their clothes and have to dress in waitress aprons, leaving them exposed in the rear. The guys use their hats to cover them up.
Everything goes as planned; nobody is able to stay on the horse. However, the horse suddenly collapses and even though Ben and Howdy are willing to spend all the money that they have won on veterinary help, the vet tells them it is hopeless: the horse should be destroyed. Ben walks into the stable, cocks the pistol and closes his eyes. A shot is heard. Ben comes flying out, and the roan kicks the stable to pieces, They give Tanner $475, all they have (the vet charged them more than $100). Tanner demands $200 more. Love steps in with the rest of the money, tells the boys they can work it out at his ranch and drives. They consider the benefits of life on Love's ranch. Ben muses that the definition of a bronc rider is “a cowboy with his brains kicked out.” They drive away, and a police car makes a U-turn to follow them.
Production.
The highly scenic filming locations were in and around Sedona, Arizona, including the Village of Oak Creek.
Reception.
The film was a sleeper hit.
In a contemporary review, "The New York Times" found the film to be a "...good, small Western—far from perfect but beautifully personified by two wise, winning veterans". Reviewing "The Rounders" for the "Los Angeles Times," Margaret Harford wrote: "The plot is thin, the comedy rather forced and the casting is unbelievable but at least it's a pleasant change from all those psychological westerns and attempted satires on same."

Thomas R. Kline School of Law (Drexel University)

The Drexel University Thomas R. Kline School of Law (previously the "Earle Mack School of Law") is the law school of Drexel University, a private research university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Established in 2006, it offers Juris Doctor, LLM and Master of Legal Studies degrees and provides for its students to take part in a cooperative education program.
History.
In 2005, Drexel University announced its plans to create a new law school adjacent to the Drexel University Main Campus W. W. Hagerty library in West Philadelphia. That same year Drexel received approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Education to start the school. The decision to launch a law school with cooperative education in a city with five other law schools was based on a demand for graduates with immediate experience, with the president of Drexel University, Constantine Papadakis, saying that employers "like to hire a graduate and have them immediately be useful." The School of Law joins Temple University, University of Pennsylvania, Villanova University, Rutgers University, and Widener University to become the sixth law school in the Delaware Valley. The School of Law is the first new law school to be opened by a doctoral university in a 25-year period nationwide.
The School of Law's inaugural class began classes on August 16, 2006. Due to a shortage of construction materials in 2006, caused in part by the need in the gulf coast due to Hurricane Katrina, construction on the building was delayed, resulting in classes being held on Drexel University's Main Campus and within the Jenkins Law Library and the auditorium of the National Constitution Center. The first class was expected to be composed of 120 students; ultimately, the inaugural class consisted of 183 students with an incoming median GPA of 3.4 and a median LSAT score of 156. On May 1, 2008, the Drexel University College of Law was renamed the Earle Mack School of Law in honor of Earle I. Mack, a Drexel University alumnus, after a donation of $15 million dollars.
In 2013, the school's name was changed from Earle Mack School of Law to Drexel University School of Law to create new fund-raising opportunities by opening the naming rights.
In 2014, it received a $50 million gift from Thomas R. Kline, a trial lawyer in Philadelphia, and was renamed after him. The gift, which was the single largest in Drexel University's history and the fifth largest received by a law school, was designated for the support of scholarship and to enhance the school's Trial Advocacy Program. The gift includes the conveyance of an historic building designed by Horace Trumbauer. Thomas R. Kline Institute of Trial Advocacy will move into the building and be used for courtroom simulations, Continuing Legal Education (CLE) programs, and development of the Master of Laws (LLM) program.
Academics.
The school offers Juris Doctor, LLM and Master of Legal Studies degrees, as well as joint-degree programs for those pursuing a degree through Drexel University's LeBow College of Business, School of Public Health, Department of Psychology and Center for Public Policy.
It received provisional accreditation from the American Bar Association in February 2008 enabling the first graduating class, 2009, to take the bar exam upon graduation. The school offers optional concentrations in business and entrepreneurship law, criminal law, health law, and intellectual property law and as of 2019 has 134 full and part-time faculty members. The School of Law is the first to have enrolled all of its students in the Philadelphia Bar Association's Young Lawyers Section. The students also have automatic membership to the Jenkins Law Library. In addition to admittance to the Law Library students also publish a Law Review, "Drexel Law Review", which is published semiannually. In August 2011, after three years of being provisionally accredited, the American Bar Association granted the School of Law full accreditation.
Cooperative education.
Like Drexel University's cooperative education program, the School of Law offers cooperative education for its students. The School of Law is the second law school in the country to have a co-op program for law students, the first being Northeastern University. The first co-op cycle for the school started in September 2007 and over ninety area corporations, law offices, judiciary positions, non-profit organizations, and government offices offered internship positions.
During their first year at school students concentrate on basics such as legal writing and contracts before starting their first six-month co-op cycle. In order to be eligible to participate in the program students must complete their first year with a minimum GPA and satisfy any job orientation that is required. While on co-op students are required to work at least 20 hours a week at their position and take an additional 3 credit hours in either a class or an approved academic program.
Beginning with the class that enrolled in 2014, all students are required to complete at least one co-op placement or a clinical placement in addition to providing a minimum of 50 hours of pro bono service.
Admissions.
For the class entering in 2024, the law school accepted 37.79% of applicants, with 22.66 % of those accepted enrolling. The median enrollee had a 158 LSAT score and 3.72 undergraduate GPA. Two students were not included in the GPA calculation, and one student was not included in the LSAT calculation. Its 25th/75th percentile LSAT scores and GPAs were 153/160 and 3.45/3.85.

1974 South Carolina gubernatorial election

The 1974 South Carolina gubernatorial election was held on November 5, 1974 to select the governor of the state of South Carolina. Initially considered a longshot candidate, Republican James B. Edwards defeated Democrat W. J. Bryan Dorn with a narrow majority of the vote.
Edwards' victory made him the first Republican since Daniel Henry Chamberlain in 1874 to win a gubernatorial election in South Carolina. It was also the closest gubernatorial election in South Carolina since the disputed election of 1876.
Democratic primary.
Campaign.
Existing term limit restrictions made Governor John C. West ineligible to run for reelection. The South Carolina Democratic Party held their primary for governor on July 16, 1974 . Charles D. Ravenel emerged as the winner of the runoff election, but the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that Ravenel did not meet the five-year residency requirement in the state's constitution.
U.S. Representative W. J. Bryan Dorn was chosen in a special state convention to be the Democratic candidate in the general election for governor. Dorn, who had supported George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign, was described by "The New York Times" as a "political maverick" who took a relatively liberal line on racial and religious issues.
Republican primary.
Results.
The South Carolina Republican Party held their primary on July 16, 1974 and the contest pitted state senator James B. Edwards against former Army Chief of Staff William Westmoreland. Edwards scored an upset victory in the first Republican primary of the state and earned the right to face Dorn in the general election.
General election.
Results.
The general election was held on November 5, 1974 and James B. Edwards defeated W.J. Bryan Dorn in what was a banner year for the Democrats in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Turnout was higher than the previous gubernatorial election because of the increasingly competitive nature of the race between the two parties.

<doc id="6936065" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6936065" title="Octopodiformes">
Octopodiformes

Octopodiformes is a superorder of the subclass Coleoidea, comprising the octopuses and the vampire squid. All living members of Octopodiformes have eight arms, either lacking the two tentacles of squid (as is the case in octopuses) or modifying the tentacles into thin filaments (as in vampire squid). Octopodiformes is often considered the crown group of octopuses and vampire squids, including all descendants of their common ancestor. Some authors use the term Vampyropoda for the same general category, though others use "Vampyropoda" to refer to the total group (all cephalopods closer to octopods than to true squid). Another term is Octobrachia, referring to cephalopods without prominent tentacles.
It is considered one of the two extant groups of the Neocoleoidea.
"Pohlsepia", originally described as the earliest octopod, is now considered as dubious for this group according to a later study. "Syllipsimopodi", a squid-like cephalopod from the Mississippian-age Bear Gulch Lagerstätte of Montana, was originally described as the oldest unambiguous vampyropod. However, further analyses might be necessary to unequivocally assign this cephalopod to Vampyropoda.
"Syllipsimopodi" has a combination of squid-like features (like 10 arms) and octopod-like features (like biserial suckers and a simplified internal shell).

<doc id="6936068" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6936068" title="2006 Indianapolis Colts season">
2006 Indianapolis Colts season

The Indianapolis Colts season was the franchise's 54th season in the National Football League (NFL), the 23rd in Indianapolis and the 5th season under head coach Tony Dungy. The team failed to improve on their regular season record of 14–2 from the 2005 season, finishing at 12–4. However, they did improve upon their postseason performance and advanced further into the playoffs, winning Super Bowl XLI.
For the fourth consecutive season, the Colts had won 12 or more games. They also won the AFC South for the fourth time in a row, and they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card round and the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional round, before winning the AFC Championship, beating the New England Patriots 38–34 to advance to Super Bowl XLI, in which they dominated the Chicago Bears, winning 29–17 on February 4, 2007, at Dolphin Stadium. This was the franchise's first Super Bowl since Super Bowl V in 1970, and first since relocating to Indianapolis, as well as their fourth title in their history (1958, 1959, 1970, and 2006). They were just the second football team in a domed stadium to win the Super Bowl after the 1999 St. Louis Rams.
The 2006 Colts surrendered 5.33 rushing yards per attempt, by far the worst since the merger, and seventh-worst in NFL history. Still, the Colts won the championship with the help of the most statistically efficient offense in the league. During this season, the Colts, who were very successful in the 2000s despite being impacted by the Patriots dynasty, made history by becoming the first team that played in an indoor stadium to win a Super Bowl in an outdoor stadium and for helping Tony Dungy to become the first African American coach to win a Super Bowl. In 2019, the NFL ranked the 2006 Colts as the 37th-best NFL team of all time.
Offseason.
The offseason marked the dissolution of the trio of Edgerrin James, Peyton Manning, and Marvin Harrison, affectionately nicknamed the "Triplets" by Colts fans. While the latter two signed long-term contracts, James' contract expired at the end of the 2005 season. He signed with the Arizona Cardinals in the off-season as a free-agent. Other key losses included Larry Tripplett (Buffalo Bills, free-agent) and David Thornton (Tennessee Titans, free-agent). The Colts opted not to re-sign kicker Mike Vanderjagt, instead inking ex-New England Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri to a lucrative deal. Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Shaun King was signed to compete with Jim Sorgi for the backup quarterback position, but was later cut and replaced with Josh Betts.

Game summaries.
Week 1: at New York Giants.
Indianapolis opened the regular season on the road against the New York Giants on September 10, 2006. In a much-hyped and highly anticipated matchup dubbed "The Manning Bowl", Colts QB Peyton Manning led the Colts against the Giants and QB Eli Manning, who is his younger brother. This contest marked the first time in NFL history that two brothers started at QB opposite one another. On an opening drive that lasted nearly nine minutes, the Colts went 58 yards on 17 plays, only to be held to a 26-yard Adam Vinatieri field goal in his first regular-season appearance as a Colt. Indianapolis scored again on another Vinatieri field goal, this one a 32-yarder, before finally finding the endzone on a 2-yard pass from Peyton Manning to TE Dallas Clark. The Giants trimmed the Colts' lead on a 34-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to WR Plaxico Burress, though the Colts responded promptly with another field goal before the half expired. The Giants struck first in the third quarter with another touchdown pass from Eli Manning, this time 15 yards to TE Jeremy Shockey. It proved to be too little too late, however, as the Colts increased their lead on a 1-yard touchdown run by RB Dominic Rhodes. A 1-yard touchdown run by Giants RB Brandon Jacobs made the game interesting in the final minutes, but Indianapolis responded with one last field goal and timely defensive plays down the stretch, and were able to seal the victory.
Week 2: vs. Houston Texans.
In their Week 2 home-opener against AFC South rival Houston, Indianapolis continued its offensive dominance by starting the game with a 10-yard touchdown pass from QB Peyton Manning to WR Brandon Stokley and a 21-yard touchdown pass from Manning to rookie running back Joseph Addai. In the second quarter, kicker Adam Vinatieri successfully converted a 39-yard field goal attempt to push the Colts' lead to 17–0. The Texans responded with a field goal of their own, but the Colts tacked on another field goal as time expired to end the half. The third quarter witnessed more scoring as Peyton Manning completed a touchdown drive on the first possession of the half, this one a 15-yard touchdown pass to TE Bryan Fletcher. Five minutes later, Adam Vinatieri converted another field goal for Indianapolis, this time from 38 yards out. Houston showed signs of life in the fourth quarter as QB David Carr completed a 33-yard touchdown pass to TE Owen Daniels. Indianapolis would respond, however, with a 2-yard touchdown run by RB Dominic Rhodes. The Texans answered on Carr's 1-yard touchdown pass to TE Mark Bruener, but the Colts scored yet again, this time on a 3-yard TD run by RB Ran Carthon. Houston scored one more time in the final moments as David Carr completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to WR Andre Johnson, but the game was never as close as the final score indicated. This victory improved the Colts' record against the Texans to 9–0. Also noteworthy, QB Peyton Manning surpassed Johnny Unitas for the most pass completions in franchise history. Manning accomplished this feat on his third completion of the game.
Peyton Manning finished the game 26 of 38 with 400 yards passing and three touchdowns. David Carr finished with 219 passing yards on 22 of 26 passes completed and also had three touchdown passes as well. Neither quarterback threw an interception, but Carr did fumble the football three times. Colts RB Joseph Addai finished the game with a career-high 82 rushing yards, and also had a touchdown reception. Peyton Manning was sacked twice in this game, and David Carr was sacked four times.
Week 3: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars.
Playing again in front of the home crowd, the Colts faced a big test in their AFC South rivals, the Jacksonville Jaguars. Jacksonville scored first on a 4-yard touchdown run by QB Byron Leftwich. The Colts were not able to respond until early in the second quarter when WR/PR Terrence Wilkins returned a punt 82 yards for a touchdown. Indianapolis grabbed the lead for the first time in the game during the third quarter on QB Peyton Manning's 30-yard touchdown pass to TE Dallas Clark. In the fourth quarter, Manning increased Indianapolis' lead on an uncharacteristic two-yard touchdown run. That score put the Colts up 21–7. The Jaguars, though, would get to within a touchdown late in the game on Byron Leftwich's 7-yard TD pass to RB Maurice Jones-Drew. That score, however, proved to be the last of the game as Indianapolis hung on for the victory, and improved their record to 3–0.
Quarterback Peyton Manning finished the game 14 of 31 with 219 passing yards for one touchdown pass, while Byron Leftwich finished 16 of 28 with 107 passing yards for one touchdown pass. Leftwich also threw two interceptions. RB Maurice Jones-Drew had 103 rushing yards for Jacksonville, and Marvin Harrison had 6 catches for 94 yards receiving. Jacksonville Kicker Josh Scobee missed both of his field goals, and they proved crucial in the game in the late stages.
Week 4: at New York Jets.
The Colts traveled to The Meadowlands for a showdown with the New York Jets. This would be the second time this season that the Colts played at Giants Stadium, as they played the New York Giants in the regular season opener. Indianapolis scored first on a 6-yard touchdown run by running back Dominic Rhodes. The second quarter, though, was taken over by the Jets as they tied the game on QB Chad Pennington's 33-yard touchdown pass to WR Jerricho Cotchery, and took the lead on RB Kevan Barlow's 1-yard touchdown run. The Colts tied the game just before halftime on a 2-yard touchdown run by rookie RB Joseph Addai. After a scoreless third quarter, kicker Martin Gramatica, filling in for the injured Adam Vinatieri, made a 20-yard field goal early in the fourth to give Indianapolis the lead, 17–14. But New York regained the lead, scoring on a Kevan Barlow 5-yard touchdown score. Colts QB Peyton Manning rallied the Colts on their next possession, leading them on a scoring drive that led to a 2-yard touchdown pass to TE Bryan Fletcher. Illustrating perfectly the back-and-forth nature of the contest, the lead changed hands once again as DB Justin Miller returned the ensuing kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown to quickly move all the momentum to New York's side. But Indianapolis took the setback in stride as Manning methodically marched the Colts up the field and scored the game's final points on a 1-yard quarterback sneak. Facing a long field and with only eight seconds on the clock, on the game's last play Chad Pennington completed a pass up the middle to RB Leon Washington, who lateraled the ball to wide receiver Brad Smith in a desperate attempt to score a touchdown reminiscent of "The Play" between Stanford University and the University of California. Five laterals and three fumbles later, the Colts ended any hope of a Jets miracle comeback by recovering the final fumble of the play as time expired.
Quarterback Peyton Manning finished the game 21 of 30 for 217 passing yards and one touchdown, Chad Pennington was 17 of 23 for 207 yards passing and had one touchdown pass and one interception. Manning was sacked twice while Pennington was sacked three times. Colts rookie running back Joseph Addai had a career-high 84 yards rushing as the Colts improved their record to 4–0.
Week 5: vs. Tennessee Titans.
Following their close win against the Jets, the Colts returned home for a Week 5 matchup with AFC South rival Tennessee. The Titans took the lead early as rookie QB Vince Young ran 19 yards for a touchdown in what would be the first quarter's only score. In the second quarter, Tennessee expanded its lead to 10–0 on a 22-yard Rob Bironas field goal. Indianapolis cut the deficit with six minutes left in the third quarter on QB Peyton Manning's 13-yard touchdown strike to WR Marvin Harrison. However, Tennessee countered on Rob Bironas' 47-yard field goal, which gave the Titans a 13–7 lead going into the fourth quarter. Showing the resolve that allowed them to come from behind in their two previous games, the Indianapolis offense delivered what turned out to be the game-clinching score with only five minutes left in the fourth quarter on a 2-yard touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to WR Reggie Wayne to give the Colts a 14–13 lead. That ended up being the final score after Vince Young could not convert on a hail mary pass in the end zone. With the win, the Colts stayed undefeated and expanded their lead in the AFC South to two games over second place Jacksonville.
Peyton Manning finished the game 20 of 31 for 166 passing yards with 2 touchdown passes and one interception, and Vince Young finished with 63 passing yards on 10 of 21 pass attempts and threw one interception also. Tennessee running back Travis Henry had 123 rushing yards in the loss.
Week 7: vs. Washington Redskins.
Coming off their bye week, the Colts gave a solid offensive performance at home against the Washington Redskins. Indianapolis won the contest 36–22 despite being down 14–13 at halftime. QB Peyton Manning, who was hit hard by defenders twice in the first half, rebounded resoundingly in the second half with 3 touchdown passes in the third quarter. On a day when Manning was almost perfect, he and WR Marvin Harrison connected for two touchdowns. The performance also saw the pair move up in their respective career yardage lists; Manning passed Jim Hart to move into 14th place in all-time passing yards and Harrison passed Irving Fryar to move into eighth on the career receiving yardage chart. Washington QB Mark Brunell threw for two touchdowns and no interceptions, but his performance could not prevent the Redskins' third consecutive loss going into their bye week.
Colts quarterback Peyton Manning finished the game 25 of 35 for 342 yards passing and four touchdowns, while Washington quarterback Mark Brunell completed 27 of his 37 pass attempts for 226 yards passing and two touchdowns. Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai had a career-high 85 yards rushing on 11 carries, and Redskins RB Ladell Betts carried the football 10 times for 52 yards. Colts WR Reggie Wayne had his first big game of the season, as he had 7 catches for 122 yards receiving and one touchdown. In 2011, Tony Dungy speculated that the hard hits Peyton Manning suffered in the first half of the game were the start of the neck issues that would ultimately lead to Peyton Manning leaving the Colts in 2012.
Week 8: at Denver Broncos.
After a convincing win over a struggling Redskins team in Week 7, the Colts faced one of their toughest opponents of the year in the Denver Broncos. The Broncos sat atop the AFC West standings with a 5–1 record thanks in large part to a strong running game and a dominating defense that had only allowed two touchdowns on the season. Both defenses played well in the first quarter, which ended with the Colts leading 3–0. Denver took the lead early in the second quarter on a Jake Plummer one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis cut the lead to one on their next drive, which ended in a 30-yard Adam Vinatieri field goal, but the Broncos answered with a 15-yard touchdown pass from QB Jake Plummer to WR Javon Walker just before halftime to expand their lead to 14–6. On their first drive of the half Indianapolis came within one point of the lead on a 12-yard touchdown pass from QB Peyton Manning to WR Reggie Wayne. On the Colts' next possession, Wayne and Manning hooked up again for another touchdown, this one a 5-yard TD pass to take the lead 20–14. But the Broncos came back with a one-yard touchdown run by Mike Bell, giving them a one-point lead at the end of the third quarter. After a Vinatieri field goal and another Denver touchdown, the Colts were down by 5 points with a little over half of the fourth quarter remaining. After the Colts received the kickoff, they marched down the field. The drive ended with a 19-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Wayne, the third time they hooked up for a touchdown in the game. The Colts were now up by one point and decided to go for the two-point conversion to go up by a field goal. The conversion was a success as Manning found Reggie Wayne in the end zone again. Jason Elam came through for Denver and made a 49-yard field goal to tie the game at 31. The final drive of the game resulted in an Adam Vinatieri field goal with two seconds left to put Indianapolis up by three.
Manning ended the game with three touchdown passes, all of them to Reggie Wayne. Rookie RB Joseph Addai had a career-high 93 yards rushing on only 17 carries. DE Dwight Freeney was credited with half a sack, his first of the season.
Week 9: at New England Patriots.
The Colts headed to Gillette Stadium for a highly anticipated Sunday Night Football matchup with the New England Patriots in Week 9. In the first quarter, an interception in the end zone by Colts rookie FS Antoine Bethea set up the Colts' first scoring drive, a 68-yard march that ended with a 5-yard touchdown pass from QB Peyton Manning to WR Marvin Harrison for the only score of the quarter. Already banged up on defense, the Patriots lost SS Rodney Harrison to a shoulder injury in the first quarter, and he never returned to the game. The second quarter was a lot more eventful after two scores by Patriots RB Corey Dillon, a TD run by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai, and a field goal by Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri.
The Patriots played from behind for the rest of the game and could not catch up to the Colts. Patriots QB Tom Brady was intercepted four times in the defeat, and Colts LB Cato June intercepted two of those passes. Also of note, Colts WR Marvin Harrison had 8 catches in the game for 145 yards and two touchdowns. The victory marked the Colts' second straight versus the Patriots after having lost the previous six. With the win, the Colts became just the second team in NFL history to begin consecutive seasons 8–0 (the Green Bay Packers began three consecutive seasons 8–0 from 1929 to 1931). Also, with 326 yards passing QB Peyton Manning has thrown for over 300 yards in three consecutive games for the first time in his career.
Week 10: vs. Buffalo Bills.
The Colts defeated the Buffalo Bills in Week 10, 17–16, becoming the first team in NFL history to start consecutive seasons 9–0. The game's scoring consisted of four touchdowns and three field goals. Buffalo struck first, as they converted a field goal attempt by K Rian Lindell. The Colts then followed with a score of their own, a 1-yard TD pass from QB Peyton Manning to WR Reggie Wayne to take the lead with 11:14 left in the half. The Colts had a 7-point lead near the end of the half, but Buffalo swung the momentum their way as Terrence McGee returned a fumble 68-yards for a touchdown to tie the game at 10.
On the opening possession of the third quarter, the drive ended in a 5-yard touchdown run by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai. Terrence McGee then took Adam Vinatieri's kickoff 88 yards to the Colts 12-yard line. Buffalo could not come up with anything on the rest of the drive and had to settle for another field goal. On the opening drive of the fourth quarter, Lindell made another field goal for the Bills to reduce the Colts' lead to 1 point. When the Bills drove down the field on their next possession, they had a chance to take the lead, but Rian Lindell missed his field goal, and the Colts ran out the clock to move to 9–0. With the Colts' win and a loss by the Jacksonville Jaguars, 13–10 to the Houston Texans, the Colts are now four games ahead in the AFC South.
Week 11: at Dallas Cowboys.
The Colts suffered their first defeat of the season, 21–14, at the hand of the Dallas Cowboys and became the last team to lose during the 2006 NFL season. The game was full of turnovers, and neither team could take care of the scoring opportunities. Colts QB Peyton Manning threw two interceptions and one of those was returned for a touchdown by Cowboys OLB Kevin Burnett early in the second half. The first quarter was back-and-forth as each possession ended with turnover after turnover. After Cowboys QB Tony Romo was sacked by DE Dwight Freeney, Colts WR Marvin Harrison fumbled, and after the Cowboys punted, Manning was sacked by Jay Ratliff and Bradie James recovered the fumble. After a couple of punts by both teams, Peyton Manning &amp; Co. pushed the Cowboys deep in their own territory thanks to the great rushing by rookie RB Joseph Addai. The Colts reached the 4-yard line, and on third down, Manning attempted a pass to the endzone, but in a controversial situation, SS Roy Williams nudged TE Dallas Clark near the end zone, and while Clark fell down, Williams intercepted a Peyton Manning pass for the second time in his career, and gave the Cowboys the ball at their own 7-yard line. The Cowboys scored all of their points in the second half after a first half that was full of turnovers.
Colts QB Peyton Manning went 20 of 39 for 254 passing yards with two touchdown passes and two interceptions, Cowboys QB Tony Romo was 19 of 23 with 226 passing yards and had one interception. Colts WR Reggie Wayne had 7 catches for 111 yards, and Cowboys RB Julius Jones rushed the football 22 times for 79 yards. Also of note, former Colts kicker Mike Vanderjagt missed two of his three field goals during the game.
Week 12: vs. Philadelphia Eagles.
This Week 12 showdown between the Colts and Eagles was originally scheduled for 1:00 ET, but due to the NFL's "flexible-scheduling" system this year, the NFL moved the game to Sunday night at 8:15 ET. This was the Colts' third primetime game this year on NBC, and the Eagles' first. There were 10 scores in this game, 5 each half. The first three scores of the game were by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai. He had a 15-yard TD run, a 10-yard TD run, and another 15-yard TD run after that. His fourth rushing touchdown of the game came in the second half. The Eagles' first score came with about a minute to go in the half. Quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to L.J. Smith on that drive. On the Colts' next drive, combined with a couple of passes and a 13-yard run by Dominic Rhodes, the Colts put K Adam Vinatieri in field goal range to get some more points before the end of the half. At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24–7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31–7.
On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a 3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game.
With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game.
Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game. During this game, the Colts lost SS Antoine Bethea, TE Dallas Clark and OT Ryan Diem all to injuries in the first half, and they did not return.
Week 13: at Tennessee Titans.
This game at the Tennessee Titans saw the return of two crucial players for the Colts: WR Brandon Stokley and FS Bob Sanders. The Colts started hot in this game, and the only score of the first quarter came off a 68-yard touchdown pass from QB Peyton Manning to WR Marvin Harrison. The next score for the Colts came in the second quarter, as RB Dominic Rhodes had a 2-yard run for a touchdown. With less than seven minutes to go in the half, the Colts were up 14–0 on Tennessee. But, within a few minutes Titans K Rob Bironas made a 25-yard field goal to cut the lead to 11 points. The Colts' next possession uncharacteristically ended abruptly when Peyton Manning's pass intended for TE Bryan Fletcher was intercepted by OLB Keith Bulluck with 31 seconds left in the half. 20 seconds later, Titans QB Vince Young connected with WR Drew Bennett for a 20-yard touchdown pass to shrink the Colts' lead to 4 points. With 11 seconds left, the Titans' kickoff went out of bounds and the Colts had the ball at their own 40-yard line. On the following play, Manning hooked up with Bryan Fletcher for a 25-yard pass to the 35-yard line. The Colts brought out K Adam Vinatieri to attempt a 53-yard field goal, but the kick stayed right and just missed the upright. At the half, the Colts were in the lead, 14–10.
The third quarter did not yield a score, but Vince Young ran wild. The Colts' rushing defense was at its worst towards the end of the regular season. Three minutes into the last quarter, Vince Young hooked up with WR Brandon Jones for a touchdown to give Tennessee its first lead of the game. Ten minutes later, the Colts tied the game with a Vinatieri field goal from 20 yards out. On what ended up being the last possession of the game, the Titans were trying to defeat the Colts for the first time since the 2002 NFL season. After two first downs, the Titans had the ball at the Colts' 41-yard line with 31 seconds to go. After a short pass for 4 yards and an incomplete pass, the Titans had one last shot at a field goal to win the game. Kicker Rob Bironas had very high winds at his back and he made the 60-yard field goal with a lot of help from wind. He cleared the crossbar by almost 3 yards, and made the game-winning field goal for the Titans for the second straight week. With the brutal loss, the Colts went to 10–2 on the season.
Week 14: at Jacksonville Jaguars.
The Colts came into this game three games ahead of the Jaguars in the AFC South standings, and with a win in this game, the Colts can clinch a playoff spot and the AFC South Championship for the fourth straight year.
On the Jaguars' first play from scrimmage, RB Fred Taylor ran up the middle for 76 yards down to the Colts' 18-yard line. On the following play rookie RB Maurice Jones-Drew rushed 18 yards for the first score of the game. The Colts led the Jaguars at one point in the game, 10–7, but after Jacksonville scored six times before the Colts scored again, there was no way to catch up.
The Colts allowed 375 rushing yards in this game, the second-highest total since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970. Jacksonville RB Maurice Jones-Drew ran for 166 yards and RB Fred Taylor ran for 131 yards. Third-string RB Alvin Pearman also ran for 71 yards. To further emphasize how effective the Jacksonville running game was, Jaguars QB David Garrard was only 8 for 14 with 79 yards passing. While he only threw the ball 14 times, Colts QB Peyton Manning threw the ball 50 times, completing 25 of those passes for 313 passing yards. Neither quarterback threw a touchdown pass, but both of them threw one interception each. The Colts WR tandem of Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne did well in this game. Harrison had 8 catches for 110 yards receiving, and Wayne had 6 catches for 101 yards. Jaguars RB Maurice Jones-Drew did not just succeed on offense—he ran back an Adam Vinatieri kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown also.
The Colts lost SS Antoine Bethea to a shoulder injury, and he would not return. As a consequence, the Colts fell to 10–3, losing first place in the AFC, while the Jaguars improved to 8–5, with the embarrassing loss.
Week 15: vs. Cincinnati Bengals.
Hoping to rebound from their blowout road loss to the Jaguars, the Colts went home for a Monday Night Football matchup with the Cincinnati Bengals. In the first quarter, Indianapolis struck first with K Adam Vinatieri nailing a 30-yard field goal. The Bengals would respond with K Shayne Graham converting a 27-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Colts began their breakout with QB Peyton Manning completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to WR Marvin Harrison. Harrison would end up catching three touchdown passes in this game. Even though Cincinnati responded with 12-yard touchdown run by RB Rudi Johnson, Indianapolis responded with Manning completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to Harrison. In the third quarter, the Bengals converted another field goal, and the Colts continued their power with Manning completing another touchdown pass to Marvin Harrison. Afterwards, Manning would complete another touchdown pass, this one an 18-yarder to WR Reggie Wayne. In the fourth quarter, the Bengals' only response was another field goal. After that last field goal by Shayne Graham, Adam Vinatieri responded with a 44-yard field goal to close out the game. With the win, the Colts improved to 11–3.
Colts QB Peyton Manning finished the game 29 of 36 for 282 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions, while Bengals QB Carson Palmer was 14 of 28 for 176 passing yards. Palmer also fumbled the football four times in this game. Colts DE Dwight Freeney forced three fumbles in the game and also had three sacks on Carson Palmer.
Week 16: at Houston Texans.
Coming off a primetime victory over Cincinnati, the Colts flew to Reliant Stadium for an AFC South rematch with the Houston Texans. Heading into this game, Indianapolis had never lost a game to the Texans, winning their first 9 games against them.
In the first quarter, the Colts got an early shock as RB Ron Dayne ran for a 3-yard touchdown and a 6-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis would respond with 37-yard touchdown pass from QB Peyton Manning to WR Marvin Harrison. In the second quarter, the Colts tied the game with Manning completing a 9-yard touchdown pass to WR Aaron Moorehead. However, Houston reclaimed its lead with QB David Carr's 3-yard touchdown pass to RB Vonta Leach. In the third quarter, Indianapolis crept closer with K Adam Vinatieri making a 33-yard field goal for the only score of the period.
In the fourth quarter, the Texans responded with kicker Kris Brown's 42-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Colts tied the game with Manning hooking up with Harrison again on a 7-yard touchdown pass, Harrison's second of the game. However, Houston managed to pull off a huge upset with Kris Brown's game-winning 48-yard field goal as time expired, giving Indianapolis their first ever loss against them. With the loss, the Colts fell to 11–4. Colts QB Peyton Manning finished the game 21 of 27 for 205 yards passing with three touchdowns and Texans QB David Carr finished with 163 passing yards on completing 16 of 23 passes with one touchdown. Rookie RB Joseph Addai ran the ball 15 times for 100 yards and former Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne finished the game with 153 rushing yards on 32 carries.
After this game, the Colts were now 11–4, having lost 4 of 6 after a 9–0 start and dropped to 4–4 on the road.
Week 17: vs. Miami Dolphins.
Following their first-ever loss to the Texans, the Colts wrapped up the regular season at home against the Miami Dolphins. So far, the Colts were 7–0 at the RCA Dome during the regular season. In the first quarter, the Dolphins scored first with K Olindo Mare's 28-yard field goal for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, Indianapolis took the lead with QB Peyton Manning completing a 2-yard touchdown pass to DT Dan Klecko. The Dolphins would follow Indianapolis' touchdown with a 38-yard Olindo Mare field goal. The Colts struck right back with Peyton Manning's 11-yard scamper into the end zone. After Dolphins QB Cleo Lemon was intercepted on his first pass of the possession by LB Cato June, Indianapolis had the ball on the Dolphins' 37-yard line. Kicker Adam Vinatieri would come out and convert a 46-yard field goal to close out the half.
In the third quarter, the Dolphins managed to get another field goal from Mare, and Indianapolis answered back with Adam Vinatieri making a 34-yard field goal. Mare would kick yet another field goal for Miami to reduce the Indianapolis lead to 8 points, but to keep up with the Colts, they needed to score a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, the Dolphins sent out Mare to kick another field goal, his fifth of the game, yet the Colts managed to score another touchdown with Peyton Manning completing a 27-yard touchdown pass to WR Marvin Harrison.
With less than ten minutes remaining in the last game of the season for Miami, they finally found the end zone when Cleo Lemon completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to TE Randy McMichael. The Colts ran out the clock and closed the season with a win at home, to improve their record to 8–0 in the RCA Dome. With the win, Indianapolis wrapped up the regular season at 12–4 and the AFC's No. 3 seed.

AFC Wild Card: vs. (6) Kansas City Chiefs.
Entering the NFL Playoffs as the AFC's third seed, the Colts began their playoff run against the sixth-seeded Kansas City Chiefs at home, where they finished 8–0 during the regular season. In the first half, the Colts defense started off playing exceptionally well, holding the Chiefs offense without a first down the entire half. On offense, K Adam Vinatieri had all 9 of the Colts' first half points converting field goals of 48-yards, 19-yards, and 50-yards out. In the third quarter, Indianapolis continued where they left off in the first half with rookie running back Joseph Addai running into the end zone for a touchdown from 6 yards out. Kansas City's only scoring drive of the game came with less than 30 seconds remaining in the third quarter. The drive concluded with QB Trent Green completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to TE Tony Gonzalez, along with a successful two-point conversion pass to FB Kris Wilson. In the fourth quarter, with 10:16 remaining, the Colts scored another touchdown, this one a 5-yard pass from QB Peyton Manning to WR Reggie Wayne.
The Colts' rush defense held Chiefs RB Larry Johnson to just 32 yards on 13 carries and 29 receiving yards on 5 receptions. The Colts also outgained the Chiefs in total yards 435 to 126 and in first downs 28 to 7. Both teams committed three turnovers, Peyton Manning threw a season-high three interceptions, two of them picked up by former Patriot Ty Law. Manning finished the game 30 of 38 for 268 passing yards with 1 touchdown. Trent Green completed 14 of his 24 passes for 107 total passing yards with one touchdown also. RB Joseph Addai had 25 carries for 122 rushing yards with 1 touchdown. The Colts defense also forced two fumbles by Trent Green and also sacked him four times.
With the win, the Colts advanced to the AFC Divisional Round to face the second-seeded Baltimore Ravens at M&amp;T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.
AFC Divisional Playoffs: at (2) Baltimore Ravens.
Making their first playoff appearance in Baltimore since relocating to Indianapolis 23 years earlier and coming off their win over the Kansas City Chiefs, the Colts traveled to M&amp;T Bank Stadium for the Divisional Round playoff game against the second-seeded Baltimore Ravens and their top-ranked defense. In the first quarter, Indianapolis scored first with K Adam Vinatieri making a 23-yard field goal. While the next drive failed to produce a touchdown, it produced another field goal, this second one from 42 yards out. In the second quarter, the Ravens responded with K Matt Stover converting a 40-yard field goal to reduce the Colts' lead to 3 points. Afterwards, Vinatieri would boot a career-long 51-yard field goal with 6:00 left in the half to give the Colts a 9–3 lead. In the third quarter, the Colts struggled to find the end zone, yet it provided Adam Vinatieri to cement his immense value to the team as a free agent pickup. He made his fourth field goal from 48 yards out; in the process making NFL history with that kick: Vinatieri surpassed Gary Anderson's mark of 32 career field goals made in the postseason. After Vinatieri's last of his five field goals that he made this game, he had made 34 field goals in his postseason career. With the win, the Colts improved their overall record to 14–4 this season and would advance to the AFC Championship Game to play against the New England Patriots at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis.
Colts QB Peyton Manning finished the game 15 of 30 with 170 passing yards and two interceptions, while Ravens QB Steve McNair completed 18 of his 29 passes for 173 total passing yards and also had two interceptions. The Colts' 32nd-ranked rushing defense allowed only 83 total rushing yards this game, and proved that their defense had dramatically improved from the regular season.
AFC Championship: vs. (4) New England Patriots.
Coming off their Divisional road win over the Baltimore Ravens, the Colts came back to the dome for the AFC Championship Game against the fourth-seeded New England Patriots, who were fresh off of their win over the top-seeded San Diego Chargers.
After a pair of punts, the Patriots scored on their second drive of the game. However, the play did not happen the way they planned it. Patriots QB Tom Brady fumbled the handoff to RB Laurence Maroney, the ball started rolling towards the goal line, went through a few pairs of Colts defenders' hands, and G Logan Mankins fell on it for a touchdown. The touchdown was one of two touchdowns in this game by offensive linemen. Indianapolis spent over six minutes on their next possession that resulted in a 42-yard field goal by kicker Adam Vinatieri. On the Patriots' first possession of the second quarter, they had no trouble moving the ball downfield and eventually scored on a 7-yard touchdown run by RB Corey Dillon, and the Colts were looking to score quickly to get momentum on their side. However, on the second play of the drive, Colts QB Peyton Manning threw a pass that was intercepted by CB Asante Samuel and he ran that back 39 yards for a touchdown to put the Colts down 21–3 with a little over nine minutes left in the half. The Colts closed out the half with another field goal by Vinatieri to reduce the Patriots' lead to 15 points.
The first possession of the third quarter belonged to the Colts, and they spent almost seven minutes on that drive, which ended with a 1-yard quarterback sneak by Peyton Manning. The Colts were now only down by one score, 21–13. After the Patriots went three-and-out on their next possession, the Colts did not waste time before scoring. Within three minutes, Peyton Manning threw a screen pass to DT Dan Klecko for a 1-yard touchdown to bring the Colts within two points of New England. Klecko was signed this offseason by the Colts after he was released by, ironically, the Patriots. After that touchdown catch, the Colts elected to go for the two-point conversion, and Manning completed a pass in the end zone to WR Marvin Harrison to tie the game at 21. The Patriots responded on the ensuing possession with a 6-yard touchdown pass to WR Jabar Gaffney in the back of the end zone. The Colts countered that touchdown with a score of their own, this one by C Jeff Saturday. He ended up with the football in the end zone when RB Dominic Rhodes fumbled at the 1-yard line. The game was now tied 28–28 with 13:24 left in the game. After punts were exchanged, the Patriots broke the tie when K Stephen Gostkowski made a 28-yard field goal to give the Patriots the lead by 3 points. Adam Vinatieri made another field goal for the Colts right after Gostkowski's previous field goal to tie the game at 31, but Gostkowski then converted another field goal with 3:49 left in the game to put the Patriots back on top, 34–31. After the teams exchanged punts again, the Colts had one final opportunity to take the lead with 2:17 left in the game, and the ball on their own 20-yard line. After two passes completed to WR Reggie Wayne totaling 25 yards, and a 32-yard completion to TE Bryan Fletcher, the Colts had the ball on the Patriots 11-yard line. Three plays later, rookie RB Joseph Addai ran right up the middle for a 3-yard touchdown to put the Colts up by 4 points, and give them their first lead of the game, 38–34. The Patriots had exactly 1:00 to put together a winning drive, but on the drive's fourth play, Colts CB Marlin Jackson intercepted Tom Brady with less than 20 seconds to play and he quickly dropped to the ground so that there would be no risk of a fumble, sealing the win for the Colts. Their 18-point comeback was the biggest in conference title game history, and would later be matched by the 2021 Cincinnati Bengals.
With the win, Indianapolis improved their overall record to 15–4 that season and would move on to face the NFC champion Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI at Dolphin Stadium.
Super Bowl XLI: vs. (N1) Chicago Bears.
Two weeks after their record-breaking comeback in the AFC Championship Game against the Patriots, the Colts flew to Dolphin Stadium for Super Bowl XLI against the NFC Champion Chicago Bears. Bears CB/KR/PR Devin Hester returned the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown, the first time that has ever happened in Super Bowl history. After the extra point by Robbie Gould, Chicago had an early 7–0 lead. On the following possession for the Colts, QB Peyton Manning threw an interception on the Colts' seventh play from scrimmage. His pass intended for WR Marvin Harrison was intercepted by FS Chris Harris and the Bears had the ball on their own 35-yard line. After Chicago went three-and-out on that possession, the Colts were ready to even the score. The drive ended with a 53-yard touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to WR Reggie Wayne, but punter Hunter Smith mishandled the snap on the extra point and kicker Adam Vinatieri could not convert the PAT. However, Chicago would answer right back with a score of their own. QB Rex Grossman completed a 4-yard pass in the end zone to WR Muhsin Muhammad to increase Chicago's lead over Indianapolis, 14–6. After a Colts punt, the Bears had the ball on their own 48-yard line. On the second play of the drive, FS Bob Sanders caused RB Cedric Benson to fumble the football, and the Colts recovered. But, the Colts went three-and-out and could not take advantage of the turnover. After a Bears punt, the Colts spent four minutes on their next drive that ended with an Adam Vinatieri field goal. There were five turnovers in the first quarter, a first in Super Bowl history. This was most likely due to the rain and poor conditions that both teams were playing in.
In the second quarter, the Colts' next possession resulted in a touchdown by RB Dominic Rhodes and gave the Colts the lead for the first time in the game, 16–14. In the second half, the Colts got right back to work as Adam Vinatieri made another field goal, this one from 24-yards out, to make the score 19–14 in their favor. On the following Colts possession, Vinatieri came through yet again and converted a 20-yard field goal to put the Colts up by 8 points. The Bears immediately responded with a field goal of their own, but they would not score any more points in the half. QB Rex Grossman threw two crucial interceptions in the second half, the first was returned 56-yards for a touchdown by DB Kelvin Hayden. Four plays after Grossman's first interception, he was intercepted again, this time by FS Bob Sanders. Both interceptions thrown by Grossman were deep passes that were not thrown accurately.
The Colts defeated the Bears 29–17, and finished the season with an overall record of 16–4 and Colts Head Coach Tony Dungy became the very first African-American coach to win a Super Bowl. The game's MVP was Colts QB Peyton Manning, who finished the game 25 of 38 for 247 passing yards with one touchdown and one interception. Rookie RB Joseph Addai finished the game with 19 carries for 77 yards rushing and had 10 catches which is today four shy of the Super Bowl record. RB Dominic Rhodes had 113 rushing yards and one touchdown on 21 carries also.
